On the back of hefty position reductions across the end of 2021 it seems that long positions are once again being rebuilt in crude as traders look to regain bullish momentum. Crude prices are now higher by around 30% off the Q4 2021 lows following the weakening of the US Dollar rally. The initial strength in the greenback early in Q4 struck a blow to crude upside. However, with USD bulls having lost momentum since early December, crude has been able to recover.|0.5|0|0|0

I have compiled a list of my top 3 crypto currency discord servers that I would recomend the most to experienced people looking to build more knowledge in crypto, as well as begginners who are just starting out.

1. Cryptodra - [https://discord.com/invite/NFH9KQNQwv](https://discord.com/invite/NFH9KQNQwv) Cryptodra provides the most in depth insight into crypto currency market, It mainly focuses on the current conditions of the market and when would be the best times to buy/sell/hedge. Behind every piece analysis is backed up with market data that I have not seen in other crypto discords, he tries to avoid technical indicators and instead focuses on; On-chain, Fundamental &amp; derivatives data. This is the perfect discord for people who are looking to take that step into growing an advanced understanding of crypto currency markets.
2. Cryptocurrency - [https://discord.gg/cryptocurrencyofficial](https://discord.gg/cryptocurrencyofficial)Cryptocurrency is one of the largest communities in discord. Here you will find people from all different backgrounds and all different skill levels, it is more suited to beginners who are looking to get started in their crypto journey. It is very active active chat and has sections for mining and NFTs also
3. Bitcoin - [https://discord.com/invite/748tBsz4Wz](https://discord.com/invite/748tBsz4Wz)Bitcoin is a very good discord for those who want to focus solely on bitcoin, you could refer to this as a ""bitcoin maxi"" group, users here are more experienced and have an in depth knowledge of fundamentals surrounding bitcoin. The admin of the group is also very knowledgable and is a very mature community."|0.83|4|0|4

The crypto folks are praying about decentralization and immutability of transactions. However, there is this so-called MEV (maximal extractable value) problem. Which is used by bad actors (miners). Since January 2020 more than 136.6k of Ether were extracted according to https://explore.flashbots.net/.

I'd like to share with you a blog post that introduces the MEV problem to beginners without tech knowledge. I hope to create more awareness for traders who are starting to trade crypto as you might see opportunities at the current bull run.

(GoHealth) (NASDAQ: GOCO), a leading health insurance marketplace and Medicare-focused digital health company, and GoodRx, Inc. (NASDAQ: GDRX), America's leading resource for healthcare savings, today announced an exclusive agreement to bring GoHealth's Medicare enrollment and engagement solutions directly to GoodRx users on the GoodRx platform.

Of the nearly 20 million people who come to GoodRx every month looking for savings, millions of them have Medicare, based on GoodRx's internal analysis, while many others qualify for the program each year as they age in. GoodRx consumers who want to explore Medicare coverage options and understand potential benefits or savings will be able to access information about GoHealth's market-leading Medicare plan selection solutions. Those who enroll in a Medicare plan through GoHealth have access to a suite of healthcare services to further improve health outcomes. For instance, GoHealth members will receive ongoing engagement and education around pharmacy options and prescription savings related to their Medicare Advantage plan to maximize the value of their prescription plan benefits.

GoHealth consumers will also have access to GoodRx prescription discounts on GoHealth's Encompass platform. GoodRx prescription discounts can provide savings of up to 80% from the pharmacy retail price and are accepted at over 70,000 pharmacies nationwide, including Albertsons, CVS, Kroger, Rite Aid, Walmart and Walgreens.

""We're excited to bring GoodRx into GoHealth's robust ecosystem of strategic partners. Prescription costs are a major financial barrier for many people, especially Medicare members, and GoodRx's platform is greatly beneficial to finding savings for our members. Through this strategic partnership, we are giving our members affordable choices to further improve health outcomes, while also helping GoodRx's users find and enroll in the right Medicare coverage plan that fits their needs, a real win-win,"" said Ben Miller, Senior Vice President, Strategic Partnerships at GoHealth.

GoodRx is one of the many strategic partners GoHealth has added to its Encompass technology, a proprietary engagement platform that maximizes members' utilization of their benefits once enrolled in a plan, ensuring that members receive the care they need. This agreement is part of GoHealth's ongoing commitment to improve access to healthcare in America.

""The strategic partnership with GoHealth adds critical information to our platform that helps users as they seek to understand and navigate the complex world of Medicare,"" said Doug Hirsch, co-CEO and co-founder of GoodRx. ""The level of Medicare expertise and service that GoHealth provides, combined with our prescription savings value proposition, creates immense value all around.""

Although GOCO missed pretty bad on EPS last quarter their revenues have GROWN BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS 2018 rev's $226M\*\*, FYE 2021 rev's $1.01B\*\*

**Last reported cash on hand (recent) $112M**

**Last reported short % of float 8.52%**

**Book value per share $4.47**

**Qurterly revenue growth YOY 55%**

**Quote from the recent Earnings report**

Clint Jones, co-founder and CEO said, ""GoHealth's second quarter revenue growth of 55% was driven by an 84% gain in our Medicare‚ÄîInternal segment with LTVs expanding 5%. Our ramped up investments in our Encompass Platform led to $17 million in revenue contribution from the platform's additional services beyond enrollment for carriers. Given the 50% top-line growth over the first six months and continued strength in the market, **we have raised and tightened our revenue expectations for full year fiscal 2021.""**

**52 week low $4**

**52 week high $19.50**

It's all about risk reward and I do not see alot of downside here.

I started building a position early this week and plan to add on dips.

Please share your thoughts."|1.0|2|0|2

Greed got to me and I just started placing trades without any analysis because I would miss even more profits by being scared of being wrong, even when my analysis was right 10/10 times (literally. It was just a lucky streak I guess). I‚Äôve been placing sells since the beginning of the crash but now everything is going back up. I‚Äôm down everything. Every time I close my eyes, I see charts. It‚Äôs 5AM and I haven‚Äôt slept, just been looking at my losses. Everything was red, I just closed the app. I favored crypto because it was so volatile but gah dang... I won‚Äôt even be looking to see if these trades closed or hit profit for about another week. Maybe a month. Maybe I‚Äôll just open a new account with my broker and start all over and in a decade or so, come back and have a look just for shis and giggles. I just know I gotta stop looking. I‚Äôm deleting all of the apps that show crypto prices. I just can‚Äôt take it anymore. Idek how I‚Äôm gonna sleep. Yes, I only really ‚Äúlost‚Äù $200 but I cannot get over the fact that I was up while everyone was down and now I‚Äôm not even in the game anymore. Or so I think. This is the third time it‚Äôs happened. I gotta keep improving my mindset and withdrawing from my feelings while trading. Enjoy the rest of the ride folks.|1.0|3|0|3

t3_ngpxgs|1621482540|traders|Hi guys! I've been trading for 2 years. Was lucky enough to achieve consistency within my first year. I just want to share some of the rules I've stuck by that has significantly affected my trading career.|"Profitability certainly isn't a one way road. If you ask pretty much any profitable trader on their journey, you'd be met by how much money they've  burnt for the sake of learning how to trade; and how you should place special emphasis on planning your positions. Conventional and generic as it may sound, trading the most liquid market on the field of investments actually needs a lot of attention to detail and groundwork.

With so, throughout my experience and journey in the forex market, here is my checklist before I enter a trade.

1. **KNOW YOUR BROKER.**  Yes, you've read that right. Knowing your broker can have a factor on your win rate. You have to know how much spread and leverage they offer--given so, it will help you determine whether your type of trading (Scalping, Swing, or Day Trading) would suit their services. For this, I use [Fazzaco.com](https://Fazzaco.com). They provide in-depth analyses on different FX Brokers. From trust ratings to news and economic datas , they have it all.
2. **KEEP TRACK OF YOUR TRADES.** Jot down your performance. Treat trading like a competitive online game. As much as possible, you would want to be one of the bests--having high win rates and a good stat sheet is one of our goals. To do that, you must be self-aware of your trading history. Trading is more than just making money. Part of it is also keeping records. I highly suggest using myforexbook
3. **CHECK THE FUNDAMENTALS.** Technical Analysis is one thing--personally, I use TA to find the best position to enter a trade. But other than that, my bias would entirely depend on the economic situation and datas the currency has to offer. Again, NEVER NEGLECT YOUR FUNDAMENTALS.
4. **TRUST YOUR ANALYSIS.** One of the many reasons why most traders fail is the tendency to switch bias while in a middle of a trade. Although some harbor success  on these methods, it isn't exactly for everyone. Stick to your plan. Remember, there are only two outcomes in trading. Either you win, or you lose. There is no middle ground.
5. **HAVE A GROWTH PLAN.** Think long-term. If you want to find success in the career of trading, set ideal objectives. It is essential to have daily, weekly, and monthly goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Always remember that rules are what distinguishes viability from seasonality. A good trader is built step after step.  Hope you guys find this post useful."|0.75|2|0|2

- Bonus: Mylol Crypto Community

Mylol Crypto Community is meant to be a group that provides mentoring education in the first place and signals secondly.

The team members genuinely want their members to succeed, and in keeping with that, they've given people free VIP access, extended memberships, and in many cases opened their live training, TA, and training sessions up to non-paying members as well as to paying members.

Mylol is actually an anagram of one of the members' 1-year-old daughters called Molly. This is important to know because the team very much sees its members like they would family in that they noticed in many signal groups there were great signals, a lot of subscribers but a lot of unanswered questions.

The team frequently does free one on one sessions with members that it identifies as struggling to encourage them to learn and grow.

For the immediate future, the team is looking to further expand its analyst team to increase its signal and TA capacity, and a new website will be launching soon to support a project they've been working on to provide a managed trading solution to group members.

- Bonus: Super Pump

Super Pump is a pump and dump group that has achieved some profitable results for those who took part in the process.

How pump and dump groups work:

The group's team chooses a coin and announces it to its members
The members of the group buy the coin and pump the value
The group's team and members promote the coin on social media in order to create FOMO surrounding the chosen coin
After the price has seen a considerable rise, members of the group start selling the coin and collect profits
Be aware that pump and dump groups can be risky, that being said, they can also be profitable, consider witnessing some results before you decide to take part in the process, and remember this is not financial advice.

The ECB minutes from the April‚Äôs policy meeting are due today, with traders waiting more details on why the central bank decided to keep its main tools unchanged in April even as it pledged to inject more liquidity through its newly-introduced pandemic emergency bond purchase program and adjust its composition as much as it is needed.  Hence, any strong comment that reflects a muddy outlook on the EU economy and flags more QE increases in the future could pressure the Euro, whereas a softer language may reduce the risk of additional stimulus actions, raising demand for the currency.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:** Yet another ‚Äúquiet day‚Äù with most things trading within recent ranges. With headlines coming out of the China‚Äôs National People‚Äôs Congress meetings, watch out for reaction to the recent China-bashing that is led by the US and its allies. For now, enjoy the lull before the storm."|1.0|2|0|2
t3_gnovda|1590029673|traders|Day Ahead and Sentiments for 21 May 2020|"**DAY AHEAD**

The Eurozone‚Äôs flash PMI readings for the month of May will hit the markets tomorrow, likely showing a reviving business sector as most member states moved forward with their reopening plans. The data are expected to contribute to the bullish atmosphere of the German-Franco deal for a virus relief fund created for the euro this week, exposing the currency to fresh buying pressure. On the same day, the ECB meeting minutes could clarify if there is any willingness for more monetary stimulus.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:** 

On a generally quiet day, stocks tried again to break to new highs, but failed. USD weakened against almost all the developed currency except the JPY. Subscribed trades such as short GBP and NZD got squeezed as stops were triggered. With the weak hands out, the strong hands will likely prevail as fundamentals eventually reassert themselves."|1.0|2|0|2
t3_gnb77k|1589980792|traders|Day Ahead &amp; Sentiments for 20th May 2020|"**DAY AHEAD**

In Britain, the preliminary PMIs for May will hit the markets on Thursday, ahead of retail sales for April on Friday. The PMIs are expected to rise, but to remain deep within contractionary waters, while retail sales are primed for a record collapse. As for GBP, it is being battered from all sides. The UK economy will reopen very slowly, investors are worried that deficits will result in austerity, the BoE is considering negative rates, and to top everything off, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is back on the radar.

First, markets weren‚Äôt impressed by the government‚Äôs handling of the health crisis, as the early hesitation to shut down the economy now means a longer period of things staying shut. Second, there are growing fears the exploding government deficit will result in ‚Äòbelt-tightening‚Äô austerity once the crisis ends, either via tax increases or by spending cuts or both, sapping demand as the recovery begins.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:** 

The rallies continue to be stronger than the sell-offs but S&amp;P500 is trading close to previous recent highs. Caution should be the order of the day as Fed speakers continue to speak of the economy in a much more sombre tone than the politicians. Horrible economic data is pretty much expected and ignored these days, but bankruptcies and layoffs will eventually take a toll on confidence."|1.0|2|0|2
t3_ghg848|1589169128|traders|Day Ahead and Sentiments for 11th May 2020|"**DAY AHEAD**

There can be no hiding from the awful economic data that is now pouring in from all angles as we move well into the second quarter. Australian jobs, UK Q1 GDP, and US retail sales and inflation numbers will be the next key releases to showcase the virus-inflicted damage. But amid growing optimism about the pandemic easing, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will likely err on the side of caution at its policy meeting, posing a downside risk for the Kiwi and other commodity dollars.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:** 

US stocks continued to grind higher, while Fed Futures edged away from negative interest rates territory to hover around 0%. With interest rates edging higher, Gold lost some momentum and backed off more than 1% from the highs. USD, however, remained weak against most developed currencies except the JPY. With stock sentiment diverging from the economic reality, it has become a market that requires patience as fundamentals will eventually matter again. 

With Australia and New Zealand seemingly doing all the right things to keep the outbreak under control, their currencies are leading the way in this bout of USD weakness. This is likely to continue as food security and optimism on re-opening of economies become key themes going forward."|1.0|2|0|2

The Bank of England (BoE) meets tomorrow. Having already slashed rates to almost zero and restarted QE, BoE is unlikely to do any more for now. But it will still have a tough job on its hands, as its new economic forecasts will try to estimate the depth and length of this unique recession.

Sterling's reaction though may depend mainly on the comments of the new Governor, Andrew Bailey. From a risk-management perspective, Bailey probably has more incentive to maintain a dovish tone and hint that his central bank is prepared to do much more if need be. Anything short of that could trigger a sizable rebound in sterling and a tightening of financial conditions, which the BoE likely wants to avoid.

Overall, the outlook for Sterling seems challenging. In the near term, Britain is one of the few major economies that haven‚Äôt announced an opening-up plan so far, and the longer things stay shut, the bleaker the outlook for the economy. Longer-term, Brexit worries could come back to haunt the currency, as PM Johnson insists that he won‚Äôt request an extension to the December deadline for the transition period, setting the stage for more eleventh-hour negotiations, brinkmanship, and drama ahead.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:** 

Trump tones down his anti-China rhetoric, and asset markets regained the positive tone. However, while risk assets were enjoying a good day, the German courts finally delivered a ruling, in a lawsuit that started 5 years ago, that ECB‚Äôs indiscriminate bond buying is beyond its mandate. So, the German Central Bank now has to stop participating in the program unless ECB can prove in the next 3 months that the policy is delivering the monetary effects it is supposed to and not just monetising the debts of governments. 

This caused weakness in the EUR but small sell-off in risk did not last. However, it is a theme that needs to be watched going forward."|1.0|1|0|1

The Fed meets later today and, having thrown everything including the kitchen sink to protect the US economy in the battle against the economic damage of this crisis, no action is expected this time. As such, the market reaction may depend mainly on Powell‚Äôs remarks. From a risk-management perspective, Powell has more incentive to soothe investors‚Äô nerves and hint that more stimulus is possible, which could briefly hurt the Dollar.

Investors will be hanging from Powell‚Äôs every word, eager to find out whether the central bank is willing to do even more if the crisis worsens, or whether policymakers feel they have done enough. For example, would the Fed consider going down the Bank of Japan‚Äôs path and introduce yield-curve control? How about buying stocks (though Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was quoted yesterday that this was an unlikely option for the Fed)?

Overall, he is likely to maintain a very cautious tone, and probably keep even these extreme options on the table. Ruling out more stimulus now would risk increasing market volatility, which is the last thing the Fed wants as that could reduce the effectiveness of all its previous actions. Better be safe than sorry, especially in the middle of a recession.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:**

Yet another day of wild swings in the WTI crude oil June future falling almost 30% at one stage before retracing the losses to close slightly positive on the day. The volatility was likely exacerbated by the USO ETF announcing that they would be selling the June future to switch their long positions to contracts further out the calendar. S&amp;P500 slowly crept to test the highs of the day before the open of the US session, and promptly sold off when the US trading hours got fully underway. There seems to be a puzzling trend of risk assets being bought during Asian hours before retracing during NY hours. Seems inexplicable why that is the case, but it‚Äôs something to keep an eye on."|1.0|1|0|1

Singapore and many other established governments are good reference cases for how things can go awry in a short span of time if they rest on their laurels. The city-state was the poster boy for the containment of Covid-19 earlier on in the pandemic, but that proved to be an illusion. Mistaking a victory in an early battle means that the war is won, imported cases started to infect the community and with uncurtailed community spread, it quickly became one of the countries with the highest % rate of infections (adjusted for population size) and eventually had to implement draconian social distancing measures.

Watch out for the increase in rate of infections for the re-opened countries and states and that will be a good barometer for how much more protracted this crisis will be. The next 3-4 weeks will be a crucial period."|0.6|1|0|1

The Fed has thrown everything including the kitchen sink at the US economy in a desperate bid to avoid total catastrophe as the deadly Covid-19 has forced most businesses to go into hibernation. That has left the Fed with very few new options and policymakers are expected to sit tight when they meet on Wednesday for their first regular meeting since January.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:** 

WTI June futures fell more than 25% but did not cause much of a panic as the market seems to have become used to the wild moves. Gold weakened more than 1% against the USD but the USD was weak against most of the other currencies, especially the AUD (+0.97%). Stocks started weak in early Asia with S&amp;P down 0.5% but steadily recovered throughout the day to close more than 1% higher.

t3_g8wn6u|1587975571|traders|TRADING TIP: Time to Shine|"Though the economic prospects of the world seem extremely bleak, risk assets such as stocks have relentlessly crept higher due primarily to the incessant money printing from various policymakers around the world. Until the folly of such policies manifests itself in the form of inflation, the printing presses will continue to work overtime. 

To sell risk assets will be to fight against this tide of money. It could work, but it sure takes a lot of struggling. The easier thing to do would be find trades that go along with the tide. Gold is one such beneficiary. With infinite amounts of fiat money being printed, hard assets in finite supply will be repriced. Gold, although volatile, will inevitably and inexorably creep higher as time passes."|0.5|0|0|0

Bank of Japan‚Äôs policy meeting will kick off on Monday, but it will not be a usual two-day gathering this time as policymakers are expected to reach their decision the same day. While under other circumstances, such an adjustment would signal an eventful meeting, the current virus situation may pressure the central bank for additional corporate aid and likely some flexibility on government bond purchases, whereas there is no doubt that interest rates will remain steady.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:** Risk assets rallied into the close without any clear reason but that seems to be the case these days. The relentless money printing has pretty much taken away the fear of the economic damage that is about to come. Economic damage, though inevitable, will slowly manifest itself in various ways. For now, focus on the trades that do not go against the tide of money."|0.5|0|0|0
t3_g73az7|1587709445|traders|TRADING TIP: Begin at the Beginning|"This seems like an obvious thing to do but somehow many people start at the end. What I mean is that quite often conclusions are arrived at even before facts are determined and analysis is done. A good example of this is that many believe that this will be a V-shaped recovery. 

This belief is strongly held to without any concrete evidence to back it. Why should there be a V-shaped recovery? Oh, because that‚Äôs always been so for the market corrections we have seen in recent memory. 

That might well be true, but the economic damage, demand destruction and supply disruption that the world is experiencing is unprecedented. To be successful in trading, it is critical to form conclusions after examining the facts. The facts so far do not suggest that the recovery will be V-shaped.

Covid-19, reopening of states in the U.S. and Oil developments will continue to grab headlines and drive risk appetite across the board. US durable goods orders later today will give us a sense of how quickly business spending is falling.

**SENTIMENT**

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:** Market sentiment turned strongly risk seeking as oil rallied aggressively off the lows. The rally got serious when the Bank of Japan was reported to be considering unlimited bond buying in their next policy meeting. The party stalled when news that Gilead‚Äôs drug trial was not going so well. How fast things turned on a dime as the US stock indices backed off from the highs and oil, gold and risk currencies followed suit. 

Volatility remains high as the short-term investor sentiment can change from headline to headline. However, focus on the inevitable.

If forecasts are true, the gauge will have retreated for the second consecutive week to 4.35 million in the week ending April 18, hinting that measures by the Trump administration may have brought some stabilization in the labour market.

**OVERALL SENTIMENT:** Another day of wild swings in the oil market but this time, prices went higher. That soothed the market and both stocks and Gold rallied on the day.

t3_bzez75|1560272095|traders|Explanations -&gt; Trailing Entry, Trailing Stop Loss, Trailing Take Profit|"# Hello Smart Traders,

&amp;#x200B;

The Trailings are very useful to maximize the profits.

You can put Trailings on the Entry, on the SL (Stop Loss) and on the TP (Take Profits).

&amp;#x200B;

Upvote if you like :)

&amp;#x200B;

Let's consider that we have a buy Entry, and that we want to sell at a higher TP. We set as well a lower SL for sell.

&amp;#x200B;

# Trailing Entry

With a Trailing of x%, it sets the Entry at x% higher than the Market Price.

The Entry goes down when the Market Price goes down, keeping a gap of x%.

It does not move when the Market price goes up.

It buys at the lowest price.

&amp;#x200B;

Example :

If you buy at the price of 100 and set a Trailing Entry of 5%, a Stop Buy Order at 105 will be set.

Then if the price goes down to 90, the Stop Buy Order moves to 94.5 (90\*1.05).

Then if the price goes up to 92, the Stop Buy Order stays at 94.5.

Then if the price goes down to 85, the Stop Buy Order moves to 89.25 (85\*1.05).

Then if the price goes up to 90, the Stop Buy Order at 89.25 is executed (buy).

&amp;#x200B;

# Trailing SL

With a Trailing of x%, it sets the SL at x% lower than the Market Price.

The SL goes up when the Market Price goes up, keeping a gap of x%.

It does not move when the Market price goes down.

It sells at the highest price.

&amp;#x200B;

Example :

If you buy at the price of 100 and set a Trailing Stop of 5%, a Stop Order at 95 will be set.

Then if the price goes up to 110, the Stop Order moves to 104.5 (110\*0.95).

Then if the price goes down to 105, the Stop Order stays at 104.5.

Then if the price goes up to 120, the Stop Order moves to 114 (120\*0.95).

Then if the price goes down to 110, the Stop Order at 114 is executed (sell).

&amp;#x200B;

# Trailing TP

It is like the Trailing SL, but it triggers only when the TP is reached a first time.

With a Trailing of x%, it sets the TP at x% lower than the reached TP.

The TP goes up when the Market Price goes up, keeping a gap of x%.

It does not move when the Market price goes down.

It sells at the highest price.

&amp;#x200B;

Example :

You buy at the price of 100, you set a Take Profit at 110 and a Trailing Take Profit at 5%.

Then if the price goes up to 105, nothing happens because the Take Profit at 110 has not been reached.

Then if the price goes up top 110, a Stop Order at 104.5 will be set (110\*0.95).

Then if the price goes down to 105, the Stop Order stays at 104.5.

Then if the price goes up to 120, the Stop Order moves to 114 (120\*0.95).

Then if the price goes down to 110, the Stop Order at 114 is executed (sell)."|0.8|3|0|3

**Daily Insights**

**Stocks sliding again as bottoming process continues.**¬†After the 3-4% selloff Tuesday, the¬†S&amp;P 500 Index¬†continues to slide in early trading. We view this morning‚Äôs action as progress toward a stock market bottom, and we could see enough fear today to set the stage for the next rally based on prior support levels, breadth, volume, put option activity, and other sentiment indicators suggesting a potential washout. While news that Chinese telecom provider Huawei violated economic sanctions against Iran isn‚Äôt helping, recent weakness has stemmed from three primary issues, all of which are tied to global growth concerns:

1. **Trade:**¬†Initial news coming out of the¬†G20¬†was positive. Despite mixed messages in recent days, progress toward a resolution has been made. Factoring all the headlines in, we continue to see a deal coming into view in early 2019.
2. **Monetary policy:**¬†As expected,¬†Federal Reserve (Fed)¬†Chair Powell‚Äôs speech in New York last week delivered on our expectation that the Fed would not be as aggressive in 2019 as many market participants feared. On the¬†yield curve, the more predictive inversions (2s, 10s and T-bills/10s) have not occurred, and even when they potentially do, stocks can continue to go higher based on history. Keep in mind that year-end supply issues may be distorting the short end of the curve.
3. **Oil:**¬†OPEC¬†is meeting in Vienna today and hopes for a coordinated production cut to lessen the downward pressure on oil prices remain high. Our projection was for a reduction in output of about \~1.3m barrels per day (bpd), but as of this writing (8:30 AM ET) it was unclear to what degree OPEC output would be reduced. Saudi officials threw out a smaller cut of 1m bpd. We believe supply is a much bigger issue for oil than demand, so we would not view $50 crude as an indication of increased probability of a recession in the United States.

**ADP employment data misses, but labor market remains healthy.**¬†Today‚Äôs ADP employment report showed U.S. firms added 179k jobs in November, below consensus estimates of 195k, and signals that job growth in tomorrow‚Äôs November nonfarm payrolls report could fall short of the forecasted 190k increase. Meanwhile, a separate report showed initial claims for unemployment benefits fell to 231k last week but has trended higher over the past few weeks. While lower-than-expected payrolls growth and an uptick in claims may sound worrisome, investors place more emphasis on the nonfarm payroll data, and job creation levels &gt;150k amid a very tight labor at this point in the cycle remains encouraging.

**Global manufacturing divergence widens.**¬†The latest batch of global manufacturing surveys for November indicate the U.S. has strengthened its lead in terms of manufacturing health. The U.S. measures are highest (mid-to-high 50s) and held firm or accelerated last month-depending on the source-while China‚Äôs measures are at 50, the breakeven between expansion and contraction, and Europe‚Äôs measure, at 51.8, has fallen to near two-year lows. Overseas economies may benefit from fresh stimulus at some point and/or potential trade deals, but for now the U.S. economy remains the standout performer globally and remains our preference to focus asset allocations.

**EM resilience.**¬†Since the September 20 peak in the S&amp;P 500, as of December 4, the¬†MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) Index¬†has lost just 1.9%, much better than the 7.5% loss in the S&amp;P 500 during that period. The developed international equity benchmark¬†MSCI EAFE Index¬†has fared slightly worse than the S&amp;P 500 with a 7.8% decline. Despite this week‚Äôs confusion around what China has agreed to in trade negotiations, we view recent EM outperformance as a reflection of the market‚Äôs optimism that a deal will come into view before too long."|1.0|1|0|1

I'm working on a project to see how floor traders can become more efficient and get key information delivered to them more quickly. One of my main hypothesis in the project is that floor traders care about hearing the news about a stock even a few seconds before others. And it is also important for them to receive a buy / sell order 3 or 5 seconds quicker than now. 
I was wondering if anyone here can help me determine if these assumptions / hypothesis are right.

t3_1nkoal|1380708337|traders|Spreadbetting Google shares|"I've been spreadbetting for about 6 months on my national exchange FTSE 100. I concentrate on three shares at a time. I chose to trade shares and not FX or commodities because over the long run shares have more volatility. Most FTSE 100 companies on average move 40-100 points a day - well I've just discovered the american markets, especially Google. Yesterday Google shares rose 1019 points in single day - so if you love volatility then tech shares in the USA are the thing to trade and try to predict.

The shares went up due to the good news over the European competion story hopefully coming to an end with no fines or regulations.

So let's hope my large bet of ¬£10 a point to sell goes off - currently 885.33, I have a target of 869-875.41 by the end of next Tuesday. A move of 1633-992 points netting a nice ¬£16,330-¬£9,920 profit.

Anyone else have any input on the Google price as of today?"|1.0|3|0|3

t3_ueg85|1338496809|traders|Advice wanted: I am ignorant about trading yet want to learn. Thanks for reading if you do|"Hi, 

I've always liked the idea of ""trading"", even as a young kid I romaticised it, now I'm somewhat older an in a position to possibly do it (casually and small scale), I have no idea how to enter the world.

Here's who I am: Just a guy, I work at a job, I have some spare money and I like the idea of picking a company, and looking at how they are doing, and investing and maybe ""winning"" some more money. I figure it will be like a casino that I can keep on my second screen at work and pretend like I can predict the outcome :P

For instance I've been reading the news about Facebook and watching their shares do what they are doing (I don't even know if shares is the right term, shares/options/futures/stocks basically float around interchangeably in my head and mean = mythical imaginary money numbers). A while back I thought to myself, 'I bet they will do this' and then they did, and now I am thinking to myself 'I bet they will climb back up now', and maybe they will.

which lead me to thinking, 'boy wouldn't it be fun to buy a small number of shares and watch them increase in value a bit, and then sell them and feel smug about it'.

now, don't get me wrong, I don't presume I'll be good at this, and I wont be investing anything I can't afford to loose.

But I would like to know more about how it works, how for example, can an everyday schmuck like me, sit down and buy $200 of shares (yeah I know you guys probably trade thousands at a time), in some company I like the look of? Just with my computer? Or have I got to employ some guy to wave a phone around on the 'stock floor' and yell a lot as per many films?

Is it possible? do I have to go through a stock broker? why do i have to go through a broker? is there a minimum amount that needs to be bought before it is worthwhile?

basically, where can I learn how to do this causally?

Thanks in advance! :) and feel free to tell me my dreams of armchair trading are foolish and I should walk away.

What is your method of objectively comparing trading strategies?

What kind of backtesting or other analysis, if any, did you perform to gauge whether you should use one trading strategy over another?

I'm defining ""trading strategy"" as the set of conditions one uses to ""time"" a purchase or sale of some security.

factors for a weaker yen :

- huge debt (highest of developed world at 200% of GDP) - BUT 95% held domestically (avoids sovereign debt crisis, but in the long run, has to print (or grow) itself out of it, inflationary, pressures Yen down),

- weakening gdp growth (the most affected during the 2008-09 meltdown, affected twice now, w/ fukushima),

- jap export industry is pissed.

- sep 2010 BOJ starts a policy of selling Yen to deter deflation, incent exporters. march 2010 G7 central banks try and help BOJ after quake. no results by june.

factors for a stronger yen :

- deflation (or, less inflation than america + europe)

- lower unemployment than us+europe, suggesting that japanese has less of an incent to get its economy moving .

- short term effect of non-life insurers selling part of foreign assets to cover huge payout from earthquake/tsunami/nuclear accident.

- safe haven currency.

- as US treasury yields fall (because of QE), carry trade w/ america is less interesting. or unwinding of japanese carry trade and the start of the Dollar carry trade ?

- yen is best available substitute to yuan given large 2-way trade w/ china ?

- china is biggest yen investor ?



factors against my own assertion :

- the yen is not much worse than it was in the mid 90's.

Opinions? |I've noticed that volume over the last few days has picked up tremendously, the share price is also closed at $13.43 today. ZSL has plummeted from $164 over the last year. Over the same time period, silver has rallied from $18 to $48. I do believe that silver is in a bubble and that by buying ZSL, it  would be a somewhat safer play to ride the bubble burst. I do understand that ZSL is a 2x leveraged ETF that seeks to produce the opposite return of Silver. I do not trade much with stocks or ETF's but I think this is a good risk to reward trading opportunity. Anyone have an opinion??|1.0|5|0|5
