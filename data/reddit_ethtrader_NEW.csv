t3_xct8v1|1663029814|ethtrader|No, we do not need CeFi to go mainstream. The main thing that made crypto famous in the first place was decentralization.|"I think its extremely ignorant when some people comment ‚ÄúSadly, we can‚Äôt reach mainstream adoption without CeFi‚Äù

The entire reason people started using crypto is because of its decentralized nature.

Without decentralization, crypto is just internet money. I would literally become no different than digital money from a bank‚Äôs credit card.

I think the exact opposite of these CeFi claims it true. Decentralization is strictly unique to crypto right now and with governments gaining more and more control over our lives, people will start realizing the true potential and importance it decentralization.  
DeFi gives us complete control over our finances. This is something that we‚Äôve never had before in history.

AAVE holders are voting to launch their own stablecoin.  
BitDAO holders are voting on developing their own L1 and how the liquidity will be used  
Curve holders are voting on increasing liquidity on their pools.

DeFi users just have full control over what they invest in and that gives these users a lot of power.  
CeFi provides NON of these features.  
I‚Äôm surprised that we still need to remind people that ‚Äúnot your keys not your coins‚Äù is a thing.

We do NOT need CeFi to go mainstream. DeFi alone as a concept is the value that crypto aims to deliver.  
But DeFi is still very new and obviously needs more time to gain mainstream adoption just like any other new and revolutionary idea out there."|0.78|5|0|5

t3_xcjn92|1663005643|ethtrader|Anyone worried about LP impermanent losses from Ethereum price possibly going up post-merge?|"Anyone worried about LP impermanent losses from Ethereum price possibly going up post-merge?

First, for those who don't know what impermanent loss is:

Being a Liquidity Provider (LP) for yield farming and liquidity mining can provide awesome returns, but at a risk of impermanent loss. Impermanent loss is where the LP experiences a temporary loss of value due to price volatility of the trading pair. Additionally, it shows the value/money the LP could have realized if they held on to the assets instead of locking them in the liquidity pool.

‚ÄúImpermanent loss‚Äù describes the losses LPs experience due to **price divergence**. The key word is ‚Äúimpermanent‚Äù, the loss due to price divergence **may be reversed** if the price divergence is also reversed. Although, this is not a guarantee that the loss will reverse, again this is the RISK!

Another great ELI5 I read in the past describing [Impermanent Loss with dragons, unicorns and magical fees](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sb7cnx/impermanent_loss_explained_like_you_are_5_years/)!

No one knows how the market will react or move, so it's possible Ethereum will go up from here and never come down or it might hit 10K and swing back down to 1.5K, but who knows? NOBODY! 

For LPs starting recently, let's say your Ethereum average value is 1K\~1.5K and expect Ethereum to hit 10K in the next 1\~5 years, are you worried about the Impermanent loss from providing liquidity?

LPs that are bullish may counter that the fees make up for the impermanent losses. For example, if Ethereum doubles and the trading pair stays at the same price, impermanent losses can be calculated to be &lt;6% which could be much less than the rewards from providing liquidity.

Would love to hear your thoughts and worries (or confidence) with providing liquidity and future outlook on Ethereum."|0.67|1|0|1

t3_xchljz|1663000841|ethtrader|üåç What is happening on Crypto Market now?|" **Read full report on our Blog:** [**https://altfins.com/crypto-market-update-2/**](https://altfins.com/crypto-market-update-2/)¬†**or in Research Hub:** [**https://altfins.com/research**](https://altfins.com/research)  


**Crypto and equities markets finished the week up with NASDAQ and RUSSELL up by more than 4%, squaring the losses from the week before.** Crypto markets outperformed equities with Bitcoin up by almost 9% compared to the previous week, closing at 22.769 on Sunday.

ETH experienced the highest jump again by more than 11% closing at 1.761. ETH continues to be supported by **the upcoming Merge that is about to happen this week between 13th** **‚Äì 15th** **September 2022**. The FED is expected to raise interest rates later in September, with overall expectations still closer to 0.75% than 0.50%. We expect they will raise by 0.75%. The US is in technical recession, as its last quarterly GDP contracted for the second straight quarter, declining by 0,90%.  


**All eyes are on the US CPI and ETH Merge this week.** The CPI is expected to remain slightly lower because of the lower-than-expected petrol prices in the US for August, which is the second month in a row. Economists polled by Reuters forecast the CPI fell by 0.1% month-on-month in August, **resulting in 8.1% for August 2022,** down from 8.5% a month earlier.

Lower inflation would be good news for risk assets like equities and crypto, however the FED is unlikely to be distracted from implementing another steep interest rate rise later in September, as inflation remains well above its target and growth in prices in services remain strong.  


Overall, the crypto market sentiment (measured by Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index) is at 25/100, indicating **Extreme Fear**. The total crypto market cap was roughly above $1 trillion. ETH continues to outperform Bitcoin, crossing again the 20% market share.

Even though ETH performed well over the last week, investors should remain cautious over the looming Merge event as the second-largest cryptocurrency has far outpaced Bitcoin, being up more than 90% since June 2022. This may indicate that the Merge has already been priced in, therefore, any rallies in prices could be short-lived.

**WATCH OUT FOR:** September 13th, 2022 ‚Äì US will publish its monthly CPI measure for August 2022. The next monetary policy meetings are scheduled for September 20-21st, 2022 for the FED and October 27th, 2022, for the ECB. The ETH Merge is scheduled for September 13th, 2022."|1.0|1|0|1

I was just curious what the community thought about using Block-Fi in general and as alternative to staking. My company is considering using them to get a flat APR over a lockup period on our Ethereum, but we had a few concerns and were just wondering what the general perception of them was.

Specifically, we were wondering how they lend Ethereum and achieve staking awards while being able to return your Ethereum at the end of the period? Isn't any Ethereum used in staking locked until the Shanghai update? How are they accomplishing this?

It's also somewhat similar to Celsius in its business model. What do you guys think about its similarity to them? Any similar risks they decide to lockup people's assets when they can't pay bills? Any other risks unique to them?

Finally does anyone know what happened to the people who led Celsius. What are they doing now? We were wondering if they might have been absorbed by companies like Block-Fi?

Stop shoving this sentiment down our throats.

Remember the ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never be able to buy ETH below $4k ever again‚Äù?? Some people genuinely thought this was true and bought into this narrative.

You have to actually study the market and study your own finances and whether you‚Äôre actually capable of investing now or whether there are global indications that point to a decrease in market prices being more likely than an increase.

There will always be exceptions in every single market. Michael Saylor buys Bitcoin whenever he gets the chance to. BitDAO buys 380 ETH on a daily basis averaged out. And even in the stock market, you‚Äôll find giants buying stocks almost every single day nonstop.

But these are as I mentioned before, the exception. These are giants that can afford to buy every day. Michael Saylor (although pushing his limits) has WAY more liquidity than the average Joe like you and I and BitDAO is sitting on almost half a billion dollars of stablecoins in their treasury.

Normal people like you and I would get much more affected than these moguls and giant organizations.

In what looks to be the market appearing to reach the consensus on US inflation peaking, projections are currently that we will be DEFLATIONARY by -.1% for the month for August. This is a good sign, and should bring us down to 8.1% year over year. At current pace, we should expect to see YoY be somewhere between 6-7% before the end of the year. 

What does that mean for us? If we get a deflationary CPI report...I'd expect a little PAMP. That it rolls around the same time as the merge means we could have some crazy price action next week."|1.0|3|0|3

And while I get the point behind this comment, it still is very wrong and ignorant to the fact that the vast majority of NFTs are artificially inflated by the owners/creators themselves through multiple accounts bidding higher prices.

I think its very sad how the entire crypto community spent billions of dollars combined on overinflated JPEGs when all of this money could have been funding more utility.

I‚Äôm not here to throw shade at NFTs. On the contrary. I think NFTs have a lot of still untapped utility behind them. We just chose to instead spend these funds on usless JPEGs.

Even NFT games had a lot of potential but ended up being ruined by greedy developers replicating successful and entertaining NFT games until the entire NFT gaming marketplace became copycat scams.

I‚Äôm not saying that all NFT games are trash. Obviously there are still big names like Axie Infinity and Aavegotchi that are quite entertaining and there even some new comers like Game7 and are showing a lot of potential with Bitdao is funding them like crazy helping helping the GameFi community overall. This is what I freaking love to see. Entertaining projects with actual utility are much needed in the NFT community especially right now.

But these are all just exceptions. It truly saddens me that whenever we think of ‚ÄúNFTs‚Äù we think of ‚Äúwaste of money‚Äù ‚Äúoverpriced Web3 art‚Äù or straight up ‚Äúscam‚Äù

This wasn‚Äôt what the concept of NFTs should have ended up being like and a big part of what made it that way is the facade of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù that many gullible people believe when in reality its all just made up by greedy owners and and creators."|0.65|18|0|18

Obviously there will be the diamond hand holders who would rather die than part with their coins. I can sympathise with that, I‚Äôm almost certain I will be hodling my coins through this turbulence too.

However I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I should be moving my ETH to an exchange in preparation for this event in case I want to sell‚Ä¶

We all know that the merge technically won‚Äôt change anything for ETH holders, at least immediately‚Ä¶ So realistically the price should remain roughly the same. But this is crypto and nothing is ever off the table, in fact, the unexpected is about the only thing you should ever expect.

So are you guys looking to purchase a boat load more during a dump after the merge? Are you sitting on a stack of fiat ready to strike?

Or are some of you up to the hilt on ETH ready to sell upon a post merge pump? Will you be trying to buy back your coins at a cheaper value once the dust settles?

I can‚Äôt really make heads or tails out of what I want to do. I know long term that none of this will make a difference, ETH seems like a great investment opportunity and in several years time it doesn‚Äôt look likely that it won‚Äôt be worth a lot more than it is now. Still though, if I can +10% my coins this year then I‚Äôd be stupid not to entertain it‚Ä¶

I know that the chance of the merge being succesful is very high due to all the heavy testing. However there is always a chance things can go different than initially planned (I heard that there will be added over 10.000 lines of code or something?), so the actually merge can be quite stressful while fingers crossed.

I decided to look on etherscan to check the amount Vitalik holds at the moment (his adress: 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045), and it seems he ""only"" holds around $2M worth of eth currently. This is very little compared to his $760M+ holdings from 2021. Anyone know his rationale behind this? It doesn't give much confidence he holds so little from my perspective, but I'm almost certain I'm just missing something here. Would love to hear you guys opinion on this :)!"|0.63|2|0|2

The original can be found in r/CryptoCurrency, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/x9xj8j/do_not_send_pow_eth_right_away/)

When the Merge happens ETH will be forked, and all users will receive a corresponding amount of ETH on the new POW ETH chain.

It will likely be a race to dump POW eth as fast as possible to get USDC or regular ETH. People might offer to trade you POW ETH for $40 USDC or something. Free money right?

DO NOT DO THIS

As of right now, the clowns behind POW ETH can't even agree on a new chain ID. If POW ETH forks without a new chain ID this is bad. It means is that when you send a transaction on the POW chain it can be replayed on the POS chain, and vice versa.

So if you send someone POW ETH for $40, they will replay that transaction on mainnet and take your hard earned regular ETH for a fraction of what its worth.

If you really want to send POW Eth, here's how to do it safely:

1. Create two new wallets (B) and (C). Transfer all your assets from the main wallet (A) to wallet B just before the merge.
2. After the merge, you can transfer all assets from wallet ‚ÄúB‚Äù to the main wallet (A) for the PoS chain.
3. Then, transfer all PoW assets from wallet ‚ÄúB‚Äù to ‚ÄúC,‚Äù the latter becomes your primary wallet for trading on the PoW chain.¬†

Now when you send POW ETH from wallet C, it contains no regular ETH for attackers to replay the transaction with.

In the beginning, people assumed that blockchains were private due to their pseudonymous nature (e.g. your 0x address doesn‚Äôt have your name). Satoshi even theorised in the Bitcoin whitepaper that Bitcoin would be private because you can just use your public key for all transactions. However, crypto requires fiat gateways with ID requirements meaning: once an address is doxxed, it is doxxed forever. Companies like Chainalysis and people on Nansen can instantly get the lowdown on what you‚Äôre buying, in what quantities and when.

This is a massive problem for both big institutions like prop trading firms and your grandma who doesn‚Äôt want to have the details of her transactions shared instantly online. Currently, transacting on a public blockchain is like having a checking account where everything you spend money on is revealed to the public automatically.

For both big institutional money and mainstream retail to enter crypto, there MUST be robust privacy solutions in place. Privacy and encryption is arguably the key reason why the miracle of online shopping exists today. Without privacy and encrypted payment solutions, how many shoppers could Amazon have attracted? Privacy is the default for cash payments, even online, so why should mainstream users accept anything less from crypto, the most advanced financial system ever built? This is why I think that having robust privacy tools is essential to crypto reaching the next billion people.

**Use cases for privacy**

Cool, but isn‚Äôt on-chain privacy only for money launderers and dastardly North Korean hackers? No, it‚Äôs not and this is a reductive viewpoint taken by OFAC that ignores the myriad of business opportunities that private on-chain transactions can create. With proper precautions (more on this later), a privacy system can empower businesses and individuals to transact privately whilst remaining compliant.

Picture that you are running a crypto company and you pay your employees in stablecoins on the Ethereum blockchain. In its current form, all anyone would need to know how much you pay in salaries or how much you get paid if you are an employee is to doxx one public address in the transaction. How many people would be comfortable transitioning to full time crypto work if they knew that everyone in the world could see exactly how much they get paid with just a few clicks?

This is just one example from many of why current blockchain design and lack of privacy is incompatible with explosive business opportunities and mainstream adoption. How much more volume could we get in DeFi if institutions with doxxed wallets on Nansen didn‚Äôt instantly reveal their hardfought informational advantages?

**Privacy Projects**

With these simple points in mind, let‚Äôs have a look at a few privacy projects as the good news is, there are teams thinking about this problem.

Railgun is built directly on Eth mainnet using the magic of [zk-SNARKs](https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/), meaning no shady custodial bridges and consensus is achieved at the chain level. It is currently live and can be accessed using the first wallet to integrate Railgun, the Railway Wallet. You can hold a private stablecoin/crypto balance and send privately as well as do anonymous swaps and soon will be able to interact with any smart contract that integrates them. Theoretically, everything that you do in DeFi you can do privately with Railgun with the same experience as before (i.e. the same amount of liquidity and using your favourite protocols). Railgun also lets you generate a viewing wallet, where users can cryptographically prove their funds are legitimate for compliance and auditability and only share it with people that they allow to see it.

Another private DeFi project is Aztec, however Aztec‚Äôs implementation as an L2 has a lot of trust assumptions built in which as we know in crypto is a big no no. Whilst they have attracted a lot of liquidity through their promise of cheap gas fees and private transactions, there are a few critical flaws in Aztec‚Äôs design which might lead to some serious issues down the line. Using Aztec requires a bridge and wrapped versions of mainnet tokens as well as having liquidity fractured between L1 and L2, leading to a number of potential failure points and a suboptimal UX. Most bespoke bridges are like big ‚ÄúHACK ME‚Äù signs for malicious actors as they only need to find one entrypoint to drain all the funds contained inside of it, not to mention bridging in crypto is a massive pain. Their validator set is also centralized, opening up the possibility for censored transactions and further security issues.

Panther is another project trying to build out on-chain private DeFi, however, they are still a while off release. Building out privacy tools is exponentially harder than regular crypto projects and it seems unlikely they have the engineering chops to pull it off. It requires an intersection of advanced (like inventing new kinds of maths tier) knowledge of cryptography, opsec, financial engineering, smart contracts, and blockchain engineering. Any team that doesn‚Äôt have all of the requisite knowledge and skills at once will build something that has security flaws and inferior privacy.

Security and track record matters a lot in private DeFi as if the system is not secure then your privacy is also not secure. To date, Railgun is the only on-chain privacy solution that has proven itself as secure and flexible and suitable for DeFi integrations. It is also the easiest to use, with the Railway Wallet having a clear UI and fluid point and click system that works out of the box. Ease of use is also key to mainstream adoption as no one wants to spend hours learning something when there are easier options available. Railgun is the only privacy project to combine blockchain level security, DeFi, and a slick &amp; easy-to-use experience."|0.98|144|0|144

Basically I have a small amount of eth like $500aud in Trezor cold wallet. I've been holding Eth for a bit over a year now. It has dropped but I'm fine with this as imo i am gonna hold for 2 years probably at least to see what happens with 2.0.

Transferring fees from exchanges to cold wallet is kind of a small killer imo and mining fees too. Remembering last year I wasted from money on mining fee on uniswap.

I want to limit the amount of fees.

I'm thinking of swapping my Eth from Trezor linked with Meta mask on Lida (a decentralised exchange) with all of my Eth. 

However, the gas fee is $10. I know this might not seem a lot and it isn't. But before I start staking, I'd like to know roughly I would make staking around $400US stEth on Lido per month? 

I'm just trying to work out how quickly I would make back that mining fee of $10AUD plus more returns through staking.

Hope that all makes sense :)))"|0.67|4|0|4

What the F***|"Okay I guess this is not exactly an ETH topic but it goes to show how much ETH, BTC and other crypto, NFTs have reached all layers of society. This has to be the weirdest thing that I have seen in  crypto in quite some time.  


The Argentine Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons is jumping into nonfungible tokens (NFTs), but with a philanthropic twist. The secretive society is releasing 77 digital art NFTs under the name CryptoMasons, with profits going back to local charities supported by the chapter.   


According to the announcement, it is the first official NFT project supported by a local Grand Lodge. A Masonic Grand Lodge is the governing entity of a given fraternal freemasons group in a specific region. While this project comes from an Argentinian branch, there are hundreds in existence around the globe.  


I mean what's next, people finding out that the Grand Master plays  Axie and Cryptogene or something similar while waiting for Dogge to moonshot and ETH to merge. There is something unsettling about this.  


And of course the collection contains esoteric images related to Masonic history and lore, such as black and white checkered floors and the infamous square and compass symbol. Even the specific number of 77 NFTs available correlates to a numeral significant within occultist traditions and spirituality.

Even though they could be regulated using Metis or any other good form of L2 solutions, some people are not ready to take a chance or they occasionally give up when they learn about high gas prices.  


Have you made any other investments before beginning to invest in cryptocurrencies? Because I've heard that a lot of people have developed a strong interest in cryptocurrencies despite never investing in anything.

t3_x85pfz|1662558760|ethtrader|Why people won‚Äôt sell the news on the merge.|"For starters I‚Äôm just a random dude on the internet, no one actually knows what will happen. I have however been in finance full time for many years and been through multiple cycles, this is why I don‚Äôt feel the merge is a ‚Äúsell the news event‚Äù if anyone cares. 

I‚Äôm going to assume sense you‚Äôre here you already know what is meant by a ‚Äúbuy the rumor, sell the news‚Äù event so I won‚Äôt patronize, it is important to realize that the phrase comes from traditional finance where companies move slow and methodically all while Wall Street junkies try to front run the price movement in order to make a living. When a company announces they are doing a share buyback it doesn‚Äôt actually have an effect on the underlying stock immediately, the company will slowly buy back its shares over a period of months, sometimes years. You will however see, quite consistently, the price immediately skyrocketing after a buyback is announced even though nothing has fundamentally changed about the company in that moment, ergo front-running the price movement. 

The merge is an immediate fundamental change to way ether is added to the supply demand system, obviously there could be a quick sell off in the very short term but the current buying pressure is enough to keep eth around the $1500 level with 13,000 eth being added daily through mining. We will instantly, from one block to the next see the issuance drop to 1,600 and will have to find a new equilibrium in the price dynamics. For that amount of supply reduction, it is objectively more likely that the price will rise to find this new equilibrium rather than fall. 

This may seem redundant sense the majority of us are here because we are bullish on eth but I felt compelled to write something after seeing endless articles and influencers claiming that the ethereum price ‚Äúwill‚Äù collapse post merge. Too many friends missed out on the price spike after EIP-1559 because those same people claimed there would be a major sell off that never happened. 

TLDR: if you believe in ethereum over the long term stop listening to YouTubers and speculators‚Äô dogmatic guarantees that the price will collapse post merge, no one knows what will happen. Now is a great time to buy, so is next week."|0.87|30|0|30

t3_x82brt|1662549047|ethtrader|How may the Merge impact DeFi protocols?|"The Merge is a pretty important topic these days since it will make energy-hungry miners obsolete, replacing them instead with validators who, rather than doing computational work, stake their own funds in order to secure the network.  


The upgrade will see Ethereum under PoS pick up where the proof-of-work chain left off, with all assets preserved. However, the original PoW chain will not cease to exist, and all assets will be preserved there, too.  


Some traders believe that the remaining ETH on the legacy chain (ETHW) will still have some value, even if it is only a small portion of the value of the ""genuine"" ETH, even though the value of assets on the PoW chain is predicted to decline to zero quickly. What do you think?  
'  
But how could all of this affect DeFi protocols?   


You probably heard how DeFi lending protocols such as Aave and Compound are anticipating problems, and are taking steps to mitigate them. I love to say that every bull run needs a 100x dog, and for me, Sanin Inu is the safest dog around, especially when it comes to all of this Merge thing going on.  


Are you aware that the lack of ETH could also cause interference with the on-chain liquidation of ETH-collateralised positions?  


I'm curious what would be the solution of DeFi platforms for this, Compound, on the other hand, is proposing a borrowing cap of 100K ETH. What do you expect to happen next and what do you think will happen after the Merge?"|1.0|8|0|8

t3_x7zban|1662538017|ethtrader|Some tips and strategies for the upcoming ETH Merge|"The Ethereum Merge is scheduled to take place on 13 September. Christmas season is here again.   ETH holders will soon be airdropped ETH PoW tokens.

What should you do to best position yourself?  Here are 7 steps you may consider to fully take advantage of the Merge:

Before we get to the steps, what is happening again?  Ethereum is going through an upgrade where it will transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. After the transition, ETH miners can no longer mine. Miners are forking ETH to keep a PoW version so they can continue mining.

1. To get the ETH PoW tokens, you must first hold ETH on a wallet that supports this fork.   The best would be to have full custody of your ETH on a hardware wallet. If you are holding ETH on an exchange, your exchange may or may not give you the fork tokens. For exchanges that support the fork, this is probably the easier option as you get the fork tokens without doing work. Ideally, the exchange supports the trading too. Some exchanges may take months before crediting your account. Do check your exchange policy on the upcoming Merge.
2. Bridge all your tokens back to ETH mainnet. You will not be getting any ETH PoW for your ETH held on Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche or any other Layer 2 scaling solution. Move them back to mainnet before the Merge to get the ETH PoW tokens.
3. Unwrap all WETH to ETH  There will most likely be a DEX on the new ETH PoW chain to help you unwrap your WETH PoW token but why bother searching for it in a new unstable ecosystem? Just unwrap it before the Merge. The best alpha is to get hold of the ETH PoW tokens immediately.
4. Remove liquidity from DeFi protocols  You will not be getting any ETH PoW tokens for ETH that are being used to provide liquidity. I would withdraw now and provide liquidity again after the Merge. There may be a liquidity crunch on DeFi protocols as more folks do this.
5. Borrow ETH from Aave / Compound  You will get ETH PoW for any ETH held during the snapshot. This means it makes sense to borrow as much ETH as possible. Combined with the previous step, I would expect ETH utilization to get close to 100%.
6. Monitor stETH / ETH market  You could either buy or sell stETH as we get closer to the Merge depending on what others are doing. Would expect some to sell stETH to ETH to get the PoW airdrop. But if selling becomes too strong, you could buy stETH on the cheap.
7. Buy the rumor, sell the fact  Maybe speculating on ETH PoW is not worth it for you. Currently, ETH PoW IOU is trading at about 2.8% of ETH. ETH will probably be bought up in the hours to the Merge and dumped immediately after. You can choose to sell ETH and take profit then.

We have about 8 days to go to the Merge. I think many markets and protocols will get volatile, messy, and complex especially in the hours before/after Merge.  One or more ETH PoW forks may show up.

Will we see another dozen ETH PoW forks coming out? Who knows? But I do know that if I hold my ETH on my non-custodial wallet, I may be eligible to get all these fork tokens. This doesn't mean I will claim all airdrops as some could be scams trying to get my signature/keys.

My strategy for these fork tokens is to sell them all immediately. Almost all the fork tokens are now dead as they are created solely to keep miners temporarily occupied with mining and have no incentive to grow their community and usage.

There are several strategies you may take for the upcoming Merge. I most certainly would have missed out on some other interesting strategies. Would like to hear from you on what you guys are planning to do for the Merge.

Of course, goes without saying everything I said above is not financial advice. Do your own research!"|0.75|4|0|4

If you're going to manipulate votes then at least don't make it too obvious lol. It's also very convenient how there's a sudden influx of Cardano supporters on an Ethereum sub

# EDIT #2: Any comment criticizing Cardano is being downvoted as well. How dumb do you have to be to make these attacks this obvious? at least try to make them a tiny bit organic LOL

&amp;#x200B;

This post is a reply to his most recent tweets where he was so confidently criticizing Ethereum and Ethereum Classic without stopping to think about the current state of his own blockchain.

And this opinion can‚Äôt be more subjective. Cardano has been online for a very long time now yet their ecosystem is non existent.

Charles promised his community thousands of dApps by now yet they have less than 600, non of which are in popular use or bring value to the community.

Over the past couple of years I‚Äôve come to realize how much of a hypocrite he is.

All he‚Äôs good at is criticizing other chains while his own hasn‚Äôt seen any form major development in over a year.

He criticized Ethereum way too many times, but we all see and know that Ethereum does indeed have the WAY more superior ecosystem and dApps. All of the market‚Äôs most popular and useful dApps exist of Ethereum.

Name on dApps on Cardano, I‚Äôll wait‚Ä¶

He also LOVED to criticize Polygon on more than one occasion yet Polygon already has more than 37,000 dApps on their chain and have secured major partnerships with some of the biggest companies in the world like Facebook and Stripe.

They contributed so much to Ethereum and the crypto community as a whole. Way more than Cardano did.

Keep in mind Polygon is a MUCH younger chain and has proven to be superior in tech and development.

The only thing keeping Cardano afloat is hype in my opinion. Let‚Äôs not forget that ADA had the 3rd largest market cap at a time where they DIDN'T EVEN HAVE SMART CONTRACTS!

If this doesn‚Äôt show how much reliant on hype Cardano is then I don‚Äôt know what does.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, criticism is very healthy especially in a competitive community like this one where its a motive to push developers to become better.

However, I think its very wrong, ignorant, and ironic for a person to be criticizing something or someone when they themselves are falling way behind."|0.69|190|0|190

Layer 2 (off-chain solution) stands out in particular. Layer 2 differs from Layer 1 since it is based on Layer 1 and inherits Ethereum's security.  


They can process more transactions, save money, and confirm transactions faster than Layer 1 can.  


Channels, sidechains, plasma, and rollups are a few examples of off-chain scaling alternatives.  


Additionally, MetisDao is a Layer 2 solution for Rollups (Optimistic Rollups), assisting in the removal of processes from the sub-chain and lowering client transaction costs. Among the top three Layer 2 platforms according to L2Beat.com, I now intend to test Metis with the other Layer 2 alternatives Arbitrum and dYdX.  


Even last weekend, I noticed that Metis DEXes had a higher volume than all of the DEXes on Avalanche, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum.

I have to say that I have long since shifted my interest to blockchain financial platforms like Algorand, Ovenue and DigiFt, so this may not affect me, but I still find it an interesting topic to discuss.  


I believe the upcoming Ethereum Merge will force PoW miners to look for greener pastures like other PoW blockchains and thus ""flood"" other coins - increasing the difficulty of mining and reducing profitability.  


As GPU miners point their hardware at other chains, their difficulty will increase, causing lower returns and splitting the reward among more miners.  


The migration will likely force many cryptocurrency miners to give up and abandon their expensive mining rigs.  


Hash rate will flow to alternative GPU PoW coins and many miners will simply give up and try to sell their card farms.  


GPU prices and demand were already falling due to falling Bitcoin (BTC) prices, which resulted in some cards being sold below list price and sellers trying to offload their mining rigs and cards at exorbitant prices.  


So although it will inevitably happen, I wonder how long it will take for the market to stabilise and how much of an effect it will actually have?"|0.9|64|0|64

I‚Äôve looked into big and small communities like Cool Cats, MonkeDao, and doodles, they each have a different vibe that draws me in.

&amp;#x200B;

Cool Cats: They strive to be more than just an NFT art project but also a community-driven platform. People have said that Cool Cats are for wealthy cutie pies, which I cannot refute lol. All of their art styles and recent community events, such as making paper puppets and baking sugar cookies, fit the cute little girls' vibe better (no offense but I‚Äôll probably stay somewhere that‚Äôs for adults)

&amp;#x200B;

MonkeDao: There are so many events &amp; partnerships going on! They recently partnered with ChapterX and you could use your 3D Monkes in their metaverse. They even co-hosted a local event with ChapterX and other NFT projects like JustApe, DarleyGo &amp; Refinable for a NFT party‚Ä¶Feels kinda refreshing to finally have some irl events and get to know different communities.

&amp;#x200B;

doodles: They used to be an interactive project but they haven‚Äôt tweeted in an entire month lol idk what happened‚Ä¶There are so many new NFT projects going on and if you stay quiet for too long, the community will eventually forget about you. Such a pity they‚Äôve been so silent. I hope this is not a prelude to rug pull.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think that NFT is far more than an overpriced jpeg, it can be a license, a membership, and literally everything. And the community itself is directly responsible for the success/failure of an NFT project. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, things are different, now, many believe that the decentralized world of web3 and specifically NFTs offers an alternative.    
 

I had no clue how much NFTs are helpful for artists until I've seen that on the Faith Tribe project there are so many great people who are working on creating different types of NFTs, it's all about fashion, but this project gathers designers, artists, it's really fun and creative space.   
 

Why do you think NFTs are important for artists?   
 

Clearly, NFTs have made such an impact on the art world since they first emerged.   
 

Allowing digital artwork to have value, through its association with an NFT, creates a new class of asset that might fit well with the lives of generations who live in the digital world just as much as they do in the physical world. All of this seems pretty beneficial for artists."|0.74|7|0|7

Have you noticed Ether has vastly outperformed Bitcoin since mid-June?  


Bitcoin has been left in the dust. By almost any metric, investor attention now firmly favors its smaller peer.   


None of the Bitcoin products covered in the latest monthly digital asset-management report from data firm CryptoCompare achieved gains in assets under management or volume in August. Instead, Ethereum-based products dominated growth.   


As I've noticed investors seem bullish on the long-term future of Ethereum, as evidenced by the options markets, but in the short term remain anxious at the possibility of a self-inflicted crisis.  


If Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin how will that affect gas prices, I mean I already use Metis, but could this mean that the gas fees will skyrocket?

t3_x6nf43|1662402477|ethtrader|What are the risks of the Merge? How do you plan to mitigate them?|"The ‚ÄúMerge‚Äù is when the Ethereum blockchain shifts from PoW to a PoS consensus mechanism through a merging of two blockchains. The upgrade will fundamentally change the way transactions take place on the Ethereum blockchain.

As of now, the Ethereum blockchain, like the Bitcoin blockchain, uses PoW, which involves nodes ‚Äî computers that are part of a large network ‚Äî competing with one another to solve complicated math problems. The successful ones are then able to mine the next block of a transaction and create new coins.

This process incentives users to consume more energy and purchase more powerful mining machines in order to increase their chance of getting rewarded with new coins. This describes why both Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently very energy intensive. However, the transition to PoS will solve this issue. 

Another problem with Ethereum‚Äôs current PoW mechanism is scalability. Ethereum currently can handle a total of 15 transactions per second. However, for the blockchain to go mass market and support the entire financial market, this limit is not acceptable. The transition to PoS will also solve this issue by increasing the network‚Äôs Transactions Per Second (TPS) capacity to one hundred thousand.

**What is PoS? And How Does it Work?**

Unlike PoW, which requires miners to compete for rewards based on the amount of computational power they can acquire, the PoS mechanism randomly selects validators relative to the total amount and time their ETH has been staked. 

Furthermore, PoS validators don‚Äôt need to mine blocks to maintain the network. Instead, they need to create new blocks when chosen and validate others when not. Once a validator, which has been chosen randomly, validates the latest block of transactions, others can attest (confirm) that the block is valid. 

When enough attestations are made, the network adds a new block. Rewards are then distributed in ETH to each validator in proportion to their stake. However, to incentivize good behavior, there is slashing, which is a form of penalty that causes validators to lose a portion of their staked ETH for going offline. 

To become a validator, users need to stake a minimum of 32 ETH. Those who can‚Äôt meet the threshold can still contribute by staking ETH in a pool (managed by third parties), and they will then receive a portion of the rewards. 

**Why is the Ethereum Merge happening?**

Proponents argue that the Merge will benefit Ethereum adoption by making it more energy-efficient. According to the Ethereum Foundation, the transition will allow the Ethereum network to reduce its energy consumption by around 99%. 

This could also help address environmental concerns regarding top cryptocurrencies. The negative impact on the environment of crypto transactions has been top of mind for many cryptocurrency critics, and Ethereum‚Äôs shift to the less-energy-intensive PoS is viewed as a significant advance.

As noted above, one more benefit of the Merge and PoS would be in terms of scalability. Following the merge, Ethereum is expected to be able to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, compared to the current 15 transactions per second.

**When is The Merge?**

In recent years, developers have thrown around dates for when the long-awaited update to ETH 2.0 will take place. The update was even once expected to go through by the end of 2021, after which it was postponed to the second quarter of 2022 and then to the latter half of 2022. 

Nevertheless, the Ethereum Foundation has recently shared a tentative date for the Merge. According to a blog post, the upgrade will be fully completed between September 10 and 20. 

The activation is scheduled for epoch 144896 on the Beacon Chain, which should occur at around 11:34:47 UTC. After this, the Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) value triggering the Merge will be 58,750,000,000,000,000,000,000. The Ethereum developers expect that TTD to be reached around September 15 to 16.

**How Does Midas Custodial Crypto-Investment Platform Plan to Handle the Merge?**

During this transformative upgrade, the first priority for [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/) is safety of user funds. The second priority is profitability. Here is how Midas plans to achieve these goals:

* Exit all ETH and DeFi strategies, close trend positions, and get native ETH assets on the new wallets to receive snapshots and hedge against potential market volatility. 
* If Fireblocks supports the ETH PoW chain on the first day, Midas will leave the assets on Fireblocks, which is the best custodial infrastructure. The team is communicating with Fireblocks on this matter. 
* If Fireblocks does not provide the speed of adding the new chain that Midas needs, Midas will migrate the assets to its own custodian infrastructure to claim the potential airdrop. 
* After the snapshot, Midas plan is to get all ETH\_PoW and all the assets that will be supported by the fork and sell them, convert them to ETH, and add ETH to the balance of every ETH holder. 

There is a chance Midas might limit swap transactions and deposit/withdrawals for a short period of time during the merge. 

‚ÄúMy advice on this Merge is to exit all DeFi pools, volatile assets, lending positions, and so on,‚Äù Midas CEO Trevor said. ‚ÄúBased on our research, ETH PoW fork will not support previous liquidity and stablecoins. Those contracts will be frozen at the start, so there is no chance of doubling your DeFi assets, including stablecoins.‚Äù"|0.82|20|0|20

# Ethereum (ETH) TVL Loses More Than $2.9B as Merge Approaches

Ether has sunk by $66.6 billion in value locked in the last eight months. It reached a yearly peak of $100.99 billion in January. Despite this, the coin crossed $2,000 for the first time since May.

The market remains unprofitable for many due to the collapse of several projects which lacks the needed infrastructure to compete, the transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network could see a resurgence in the amount of liquidity poured into the decentralized finance market.

# Ethereum miners made $756 million in revenue in August ahead of the Merge

ETH miners generated $756 million in revenue in August, up 37% from July's $545 million revenue. Just over $30 million of that amount constituted transaction fees, with the rest as block subsidies to miners.

August was the last full month of mining on the blockchain, which will shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) system between Sept. 10 and 20.

Some in the industry have speculated that PoW forks may emerge post-Merge, providing a new source of income for miners.

# Bill Murray‚Äôs Ethereum Wallet Hacked for $174K After NFT Charity Auction

Actor and comedian Bill Murray‚Äôs wallet, which is controlled by his business partners, was hacked last night. About $174,000 worth of Wrapped Ethereum was stolen from the wallet, worth about $174k at the time of the attack.

Attackers gained access to the wallet through a wallet-draining exploit, which could be tied to a hijacked work computer. The wallet also held nearly 800 NFTs from the Bill Murray 1,000 project that are set to be sold next week.

The money was earmarked to support the care of a three-year-old girl named Evelyn.

* There will be some last minute FOMO to get those forked ETH POW coins.  People will be swapping their tokens for native ETH before the fork.  There may also be some last minute fear from some, and they will try to sell and rebuy after the merge.  This will cause one last dip on liquid staking tokens - cbETH (Coinbase), rETH (Rocketpool), and stETH (Lido).
* After the merge is complete, people will have their forked coins. The execution uncertainty of the merge will have passed and staking rewards go up as MEV and tips come in.  I think this is the perfect recipe for people to quickly pile back into staking positions.  The liquid staking tokens will likely close the gap to 1:1 ETH pretty quickly.

So if you already have ETH, I think you've got a choice to make in the next 10 days:

* Gobble up liquid staking tokens on a last discount for an easy 5% to 8% boost to your stack.
* Hold your ETH on main net and see how much your forked ETHPOW goes for."|1.0|10|0|10

I am 16 and have been investing in Ethereum since November 2021. I just crossed my milestone of 3 ETH and wanted to hear some opinions on things I have been curious about.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Since I have heavily been putting 99% of my minimum wage income into Ethereum for almost a year, should I invest in stocks and other assets as a backup? Although I do fully believe in Ethereum's potential I feel like it isn't a bad idea to diversify (even though I am young and can risk it.)
2. Is there a reliable place/indicator for ETH future price? (ex. Ethereum will be worth $3,500 per coin in 2023 and here's why...)
3. I'm currently holding my ETH in a Robinhood account, should I get a cold wallet and transfer to a trezor/ledger?

Instead of a fork going against Ethereum and progressive tech how about if there was a fork that aided Ethereum and filled the gaps in its capabilities.

Testing tech and economics can go hand in hand when it comes to blockchains like Ethereum but current testnets on Ethereum only test the tech side. A ""future chain"" that updates to new versions of Ethereum before Ethereum does and is able to test the tech and economics of these updates in a very radical way could greatly increase the rate that Ethereum is able to innovate.

Testnets are one thing but what I'm suggesting isn't a testnet. This could be a ""midnet"" to Ethereum and on this chain the full extent of technological innovation could be tested while at the same time seeing what economic effects this tech has since this chain will have value. Since we will update to future versiosn of Ethereum before the ""Official"" Ethereum does we will also be able to catch future bugs that would have hit Ethereum before they cause any damage to the ""official"" Ethereum.

Think about the service Kusama provides for Polkadot, I'm basically proposing to bring something similar to that to Ethereum.

I've been working on this lately and can have it up and running in a couple days, do you think this is something I should go through with and launch? Do you think this would bring value to the Ethereum ecosystem?"|0.64|3|0|3
t3_x49q05|1662145634|ethtrader|Curve &amp; Convex: Additional rewards and boosted interest rates|"Decentralized finance (DeFi) users can put their digital assets to work and generate passive income in different ways. One tactic is providing liquidity to automated market makers (AMMs), where users can lock up or stake their coins in exchange for a share of transaction fees or governance tokens.

For instance, Curve Finance, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that uses an AMM to facilitate the trade of digital assets in a permissionless way, distributes 50% of its generated fees among liquidity providers (LPs). It is worth noting that Curve focuses on efficient stablecoin trading, which also enables LPs to minimize the risk of impermanent loss.

Despite its benefits, Curve can be quite confusing and intimidating to new DeFi users. Convex Finance aims to address this issue. By making it easy to optimize providing liquidity on Curve and boosting CRV rewards, the protocol has burst in popularity lately. 

## What is Curve Finance (CRV)?

Curve is a popular AMM that offers a highly efficient way to exchange tokens by only accommodating liquidity pools made up of similarly behaving assets. These assets are mostly stablecoins, but also include different tokenized versions of stablecoins and other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Notably, Curve‚Äôs pricing formula makes it extremely useful for swapping between tokens that remain in a relatively similar price range. It enables users to avoid more volatile crypto assets while still earning high interest rates, making the protocol particularly conservative since it favors stability.

This way, Curve maintains low fees, low slippage, and next to no risk of impermanent loss. And to compensate for the low fees that liquidity providers get, it delivers rewards in the form of CRV tokens and interest by integrating with external DeFi protocols.

CRV is the governance token of CurveDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) running Curve Finance. The token is continuously distributed to liquidity providers of the protocol, with the rate decreasing annually. 

CRV tokens are convertible into veCRV (vote-escrowed CRV), which can be used in governance, boosting rewards, earning trading fees, and receiving airdrops. The more veCRV a user accumulates, the more they can boost their CRV rewards from liquidity pools.

Users can utmost boost their CRV rewards by 2.5x, but they need to apply the maximum amount of veCRV required for their deposited liquidity. Naturally, the more CRV tokens a user deposits, the more veCRV will be required to boost the rewards up to 2.5x.

It is quite inconvenient for small liquidity providers to purchase CRV, lock some of it into veCRV, and then use veCRV to boost the remaining CRV rewards. Similarly, big liquidity providers might find it difficult to gather enough veCRV needed to max boost their astronomical amount of CRV. This is where Convex Finance comes into play. 

## What is Convex Finance?

Built on top of Curve Finance, Convex Finance (CVX) is an innovative DeFi protocol that allows CRV token holders and Curve liquidity providers to earn additional rewards and boost their interest rates. To further benefit users, the platform charges no withdrawal fee and negligible performance fees.

Convex achieves this by allowing users to pool their assets. The platform then uses all of the gathered assets to acquire more CRV, converts them into veCRV, and uses veCRV to boost CRV rewards for all Curve LP token holders. No matter how large or small a user‚Äôs stake in a Curve pool is, Convex usually allows them to boost rewards by up to 2.5x as long as they have Curve LP tokens.

Essentially, Convex allows two cohorts of Curve users to generate boosted rewards: Curve LPs and CRV holders. Curve liquidity providers are paid boosted CRV incentives if they use Convex, which is mainly because other users have also locked their CRV tokens with the protocol. 

Similarly, CRV stakers can earn additional rewards by locking their coins in Convex. Besides the trading fees from the Curve platform and an amount of CRV, stakers will also receive CVX rewards. CVX is the native token of Convex, minted pro-rata for each CRV token claimed on Convex Finance by the liquidity providers of Curve.

By further staking CVX tokens on Convex, users will be able to earn cvxCRV tokens. CvxCRV is a tokenized form of veCRV. It is also revenue generating, offering holders rewards from the Convex protocol and admin fees from the Curve protocol.

However, it is worth noting that staking on the Convex platform is a one-way transaction. Once users convert CRV into cvxCRV, they won‚Äôt be able to go back. That is because the converted CRV will be locked into the Curve protocol and will become Curve Liquidity Pool tokens, which are responsible for maximizing incentives for the entire Convex ecosystem.

## Convex Finance to Boost Rewards in CeDeFi Strategies

[Midas.Investments](http://midas.investments/), the first CeDeFi custodial platform, seeks to create profitable investment tools for users by developing strategies that combine working with different crypto assets and various protocols. Some of these strategies use Convex Finance to offer boosted rewards. 

Specifically, Midas.Investments makes use of Convex Finance in a CeDeFi strategy called DeFi Token Farming. The strategy is a basket of incentivized liquidity pools with DeFi tokens on Convex Finance that can generate up to 35% ROI.  

This strategy taps into top-tier liquidity pools in DeFi with some major cryptocurrencies. Convex is the primary source of this strategy‚Äôs yield, with each liquidity pool including incentivized rewards from the protocol. The strategy acts as a long position on the entire DeFi ecosystem.

Currently, the DeFi Token Farming strategy makes use of five liquidity pools, which include CRV + cvxCRV, CRV + ETH, CVX + ETH, FXS + cvxFXS, Silo + FRAX, each of which is projected to offer an approximate APR of 25%, 30%, 40%, 30%, and 60%, respectively."|0.76|10|0|10

I've always been thinking about grabbing a piece of virtual real estate too, and therefore, I DID IT.

At first, I intended to just hold it for a while and sell at a profit, but then I was told that holding it for the long term would be more lucrative. Tho I won‚Äôt sell my land right away, I can‚Äôt just sit here waiting (unlike some of my friends, I don‚Äôt really enjoy building things in Sandbox, nor minecrafts lol. I would rather all-in on Sims if it‚Äôs profitable) 

I googled some protocols on metaverse mortgages that allow me to borrow cryptos against my Sandbox LAND. Perhaps I can earn more money by investing in more land and NFTs? But this can be risky as a lot could happen, like fraud, volatility, and technical issues with the blockchain structure etc.

So far I've got NFTY Finance, MetaLend and TerraZero on my list. NFTY Finance supports different NFTs for instant liquidity; MetaLend mainly supports Sandbox &amp; Axie; and TerraZero is only supporting Decentraland for now. Compared to NFTY Finance and TerraZero, MetaLend is kinda new and smaller in scale, but it seems that their interest rates are more reasonable. I‚Äôm afraid of loan shark interest rates of big projectsss‚Ä¶ the bigger the project, the higher the rates. And as someone that‚Äôs new to Defi &amp; lending protocols, I just want something that‚Äôs easy to use and risk free.

Has anyone tried these protocols before? And which of these would you recommend for someone new to DeFi?"|0.69|6|0|6

But when I say ‚Äúnot all L2s are built the same‚Äù I‚Äôm not talking about are the features that give an L2 the upper hand. I‚Äôm talking about ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù that compromise security and might even lead to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars from the Ethereum blockchain.

I‚Äôm mainly talking about something called ‚Äúsingle point of failure‚Äù

Let me explain to those that don‚Äôt know what it is.

The way L2s validate transactions is through sequencers which then gets settled on Ethereum after. And there are some Ethereum L2s out there, namely Optimism, that do all their computing one single centralized sequencer meaning that if said sequencer ever fails, gets hacked, or experiences any sanctions, many people (if not all using Optimism) would get screwed and end up losing all their money.

I think it‚Äôs pretty ironic of L2s like Optimism to be calling other L2s especially Polygon Hermez ‚Äúcentralized‚Äù when Optimism themselves operate a sequencer that makes them centralized from within.

Polygon at least operates a decentralized sequencer while also developing open source zkEVM backed completely by Ethereum‚Äôs security and decentralization.

This just goes to show that just cause an L2 looks ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù from the outside, doesn‚Äôt really mean that they are.

You have to always delve deep into the mechanics of an L2s and the way they settle transactions before getting the full picture.

This kind of false advertising is a problem because not many people are informed enough to be able to understand technical terms and research them.

You‚Äôd have to be pretty involved in how the Ethereum virtual machine works for you to understand exactly which L2s are great, good, bad and the worst.

I‚Äôm pretty sure that I‚Äôm not the only person here who thought about this but I‚Äôm on this sub almost every day and I still haven‚Äôt seen anyone talk about ‚Äúsingle point of failure‚Äù which is a huge problem for many of us users."|0.83|8|0|8

t3_x3eonl|1662056497|ethtrader|Ethereum might split into 2 chains after the merge- A historical look at price action of previous splits with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero|"Whenever there's a hard fork, there's a chance one coin splits into two.  The first time this occurred was with Ethereum in July 2016, due to the DAO Hack, which created Ethereum Classic.  Since then, other notable forks include Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash (July 2017), Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin SV (November 2018), Litecoin to Litecoin Cash (February 2018), and Monero to Monero Classic (April, 2018).

All these splits happened for philosophical reasons I won't get into, but what I am interested in exploring is how the old and new chains reacted in the market and how the price action played out.

The following table lists the 5 hard forks that caused the splits.  The prices listed were gathered from CoinMarketCap and listed as the close price on the appropriate date.  You will be able to see the price movements through the years and the relative difference of the old chain to the new chain.  The dates listed are the first date CMC had price info on the coin, not necessarily the day the fork happened.

**NOTE:** To scroll through the table, scroll to the bottom of the post. There will a scroll bar.

Looking at this data, the 5/6 coin splits had the new chain outperform the original chain after 1 month, but only 1/6 chains (BCH to BSV) had the new chain outperform the old chain over time and this was a split of a split.

t3_x37gg0|1662038234|ethtrader|2023-2024 will be pivotal years for Ethereum. I can‚Äôt wait to finally be able to experience an improved and efficient version of Ethereum.|"We got almost accustomed to high gas fees and waiting way too long for transactions to get validated to the point where we don‚Äôt even think about it anymore. That‚Äôs just how Ethereum is and we basically took it as it is.

But it really shouldn‚Äôt be like that. Vitalik‚Äôs vision was to eventually find a solution to the trilemma and that vision is slowly but sure becoming a reality.

The first step will be the merge which is supposed to happen anytime now in September.

I‚Äôm really glad about the merge happening because this will mean that energy consumption will drastically fall and more institutions can start building on Ethereum thus boosting its adoption in the real world.

But what really has me excited are the updates coming after the merge.

With the merge fully implemented, the Ethereum development team will finally be able to work on solving Ethereum‚Äôs scalability issues transforming the blockchain into a much more user friendly and efficient chain.

L2s will be given major boosts in performance and will basically make gas fees irrelevant.

Transactions will cost fractions of fractions of a cent and waiting times will decrease by a significant margin.

Can you imagine this? An Ethereum where DeFi and DAOs cost mere fractions of a cent to use and operate? That‚Äôs so freaking surreal!

In fact we‚Äôre already seeing a lot of major developments from L2s notably in the zero-knowledge sector where L2s are working on developing zkEVMs to make developers‚Äô life easier 

ZkSync already had a zkEVM testnet that is live and they‚Äôre working on other DeFi scaling solutions as well. They‚Äôre even developing a DAO specific scaling solution for bitDAO (ZkDAO) which will be used by the later as a tool to help users with the notoriously high gas fees related to DeFi and DAOs.

Others like Scroll, Immutable X and Loopring are also developing interesting scalability technologies all of which will help Ethereum scale.

All of these efforts combined will be of great importance once Ethereum merges and moves over to the next step of scaling through L2s.

Ethereum critics will finally shut up since the main arguments against Ethereum (high energy consumption and high gas fees) will be of no relevance anymore.

2023-2024 will be the years where Ethereum transforms into something entirely new and I really can‚Äôt wait to see how it all unfolds."|0.78|12|0|12

Blockchain certainly brings video games to a whole new level and it will continue to transform the gaming industry in terms of how games are made, developed, and played.  


At the beginning of this type of gaming I was totally against it, typical hater haha but now, tbh I can't imagine not playing all these cool NFT-powered games. It was quite a pleasure hearing at the AIBC summit last week in Belgrade, about all these amazing plans that game developers have for blockchain gaming.  


What type of blockchain games do you enjoy the most?  


I believe it's fantastic that they have finally realized that we need more interesting gameplay because that is what draws players, not necessarily the earning part.

Many industries started using them because of their great possibilities, but somehow it seems that people are not that hyped anymore.   


So, what do you think that's the next logical step to happen so NFTs could get all that old fame?   


As we had Moonbirds into the spotlight, now we have fashion NFTs (which I wasn't crazy about it tbh until I discovered Faith Tribe), Dour Darcels, the hugely successful NFT community's first project, is launching a collection of 10,000 fashion-focused NFTs.  


Could this cause the NFT market to flourish or do we actually need something much more?  


Did people get used to them, so they're not even so much interesting as was the case at the beginning or there are not so many interesting projects these days?   


The interesting fact is that $176 million was spent on NFTs in the first week of May 2021, but since May, sales appear to have settled to between $10 and $20 million a week.

Since I've been a part of this community for years, I would love to hear your opinion pls, I already heard many times ""You need to research each and come to a decision based on gained knowledge, not by random people on the internet who may or may not know what they're talking about,"" but I'd still like to hear your experiences and opinions.  


Truth be told I want to invest 10,000 dollars into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and some interesting Altcoin with a lot of potentials.  


I already bought some of ETH last year, started getting this whole picture of crypto, getting to know all about it (still learning), and started using Metis as an L2 solution, but I hope this all will be reduced after the merge and the price are gonna rise and rise once again.  


What do you think about buying ETH now? We're seeing that the ETH price started rising, it actually started a fresh increase above the $1,600 resistance against the US Dollar. Do you think it's now gaining pace and might rise further towards the $1,650 level?  


Is this scenario possible for ETH, that a clear move above the $1,650 level might send the price towards $1,700 resistance? I suppose that any more gains may perhaps open the doors for a test of the $1,750 resistance in the near term.  


Would love to hear your thoughts, thanks."|0.86|53|0|53

Do most people just not make money for MANY years in crypto? lol Not braggin at all but this is my third year actively trading and I made a decent amount every year, so I had to report both of those since relatively big amounts of usd left coinbase to my bank account. Did I just get lucky? Am I weird for not thinkin ""this 10x will 10x again, I'm holding""?? Do a lot of people just hold a 10,15,20x then just ride it back down? lol Wtf is goin on like so many people were sayin they'll report \*when\* they cash out. If u bought anytime before like fall 21 u made good money. Why would u not take out some usd? It's been pretty easy (for me) to make multiple 5-10x's for every year since 2020 whether via spot trading, swapping, leverage trading, etc., would suck to think \*THAT\* many people just rode it back down.. I cashed out for like every 5x I made on initial buys, which was about a dozen times...

I found out that A ChainPlay survey participated by 2428 GameFi investors revealed that 75% of the respondents joined the crypto space solely because of GameFi.  


81% of GameFi investors are moving away from the traditional mindset and prioritizing the fun factor over profit-making as they seek positive in-game experiences.  


If you ask me I think that a good in-game experience is the most important, that will actually keep gamers to play these games. This will keep gamers and plus if there are ways of earning, investors would be happy to check out these games as well.  


Game developers now have so many opportunities to use NFTs for a player good, to use Altura to integrate blockchain-backed assets in your applications without the need for any web3 knowledge.

I really love what NFTs achieve, they obviously have created a new, more approachable market for new age and contemporary artists. In 2021, an auction house successfully sold an NFT of a piece of modern art for a whopping amount of US$ 69 million compared to other more famous works, like that of Van Gogh, which sold for nearly half this amount despite its historical relevance and global recognition.  


NFTs are probably most popular in the gaming and fashion industry too, I become more familiar with fashion NFTs not because of these famous fashion brands that announced their NFT collection, it's because of Faith Tribe, I love how it's empowering young designers, love when I see some useful things that NFTs may actually provide.   


Despite these advantages of increased markets, raised funds, and reduced digital reproduction, the unregulated NFT space does not provide desired safety for artists, collectors, and sellers.  


Do you think that it's about time for artists to get some regulations that will help them with their future work?

But, unfortunately not, so choose wisely L2 solution, I will stick to Metis.  


However, don't you think that the recent selling pressure shows that fears of global macro have taken over the Merge optimism?  


Ethereum‚Äôs drop ahead of the impending Merge is also of note as bearish sentiment appears to be taking hold across all so-called risk assets.   


After the first Ethereum network fork, which will take place on September 6 and enhance the likelihood of Merge, we shall see how everything turns out. If everything goes according to plan, EHT might regain its power and surge all the way to $2,200."|0.69|12|0|12

So, what exactly the upcoming Merge is? The Merge is a joining of the Ethereum's layer with its new proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus layer, the Beacon Chain. It reduces the energy-intensive mining and secures the network using staked ETH. All this means more scalability, security, and sustainability.

According to the officials, the Merge will be ready within Q3/Q4 2022, so what projects can't wait for it? We have our personal top 3 for you to share.  


‚úÖ **Lido DAO**

That‚Äôs a liquid staking protocol on Ethereum. The project offers an opportunity to lock the ETH coins on the PoS consensus for a daily reward. Due to a growing number of people eager to participate in validating a new Ethereum chain, the project is getting a contender for native token price growth. Lido has already reacted by growing by 30% amid the news about the upcoming merger.  


‚úÖ  **Ethereum Classic**

The news about Merge renovations on the Ethereum blockchain triggered the ETH price growth up 50% during the week. The price jump occurred amid expectations and vast investments into the ETH ecosystem from Bitmain, a leading mining equipment manufacturer. The coin is in the TOP 30 by market capitalization.  


That's the only blockchain with a launching PoW-based smart-contracts opportunity and Ethash mining algorithm. According to the developers, the number of miners will help the safety growth and attract even more DeFi projects to ETH.  


The miners using a particular ASIC for mining ETH will be pushed to move to the Ethereum Classic dues to the process's peculiarities.  


### ‚úÖ  DYDX

It‚Äôs a decentralized exchange with margin and derivatives trading. The boosting of transactions‚Äô speed will make the exchange more attractive for traders. The exchange will gain an opportunity to create competition for centralized marketplaces. Low Ethereum transaction speeds based on PoW were a main stopper for decentralized exchanges with a margin trading feature.¬†

Or will it? If they choose to continue mining the current (then: old) Ethereum chain, will there be two Ether coins? Indeed. Some exchanges have already signaled they will list a possible ETH POW coin post-Merge. How to deal with this?**

First, a reminder of what the Merge is. The network that we know as Ethereum (ETH1) will be merging with the Beacon Chain (ETH2). Until the Merge, the Beacon Chain is a separate network running parallel to Ethereum.

The Ethereum Merge refers to the merging of the current Ethereum blockchain and the chain that is now running in parallel and being tested: the Beacon chain. This Beacon chain, which is based on Proof-of-stake (PoS), will become the main chain after the Merge. It will, as it were, swallow the old chain, including its entire history.

Will you Own Double the Amount of ETH Coins Post-Merge?

In principle, and after all the dust will have settled, nothing will have happened. So don‚Äôt stress. Your existing ETH will work just as it always has and be unaffected. You do not need to do anything. You don‚Äôt need to buy another ETH asset to participate in Ethereum 2. But for those of us who are interested in deep-dives and trading, listen to this.

After the Merge, the miners are no longer needed to secure the Ethereum blockchain and are invited to switch off their equipment - or move to Ethereum Classic, which will stay a proof-of-work chain.

But miners have a financial incentive to keep mining the old chain and extract the last bit of value out of it. And nobody can tell anyone not to trade the coin associated with the old chain. Let‚Äôs call that coin ETH POW. Exchanges like Poloniex have already stated that they will support this potential Ethereum POW coin:

*'Prior to the official ETH 2.0 upgrade, ETH holders on Poloniex can go to the swap page to swap their ETH into two ""potential forked"" tokens, ETHS \[IOU\] and ETHW \[IOU\], at a 1:1 ratio'.* 

So on an exchange like Poloniex, you can make sure that you will get both the old ETH POW token and the new Proof-of-Stake (POS) ETH token. And you could sell that ETH POW token on the market as you choose.

What if the Merge will complete without a fork? In that case, nothing happens. Poloniex will just keep the ETH symbol. *‚ÄòIn this case, Poloniex will suspend and delist ETHS, ETHW, and their associated markets.‚Äô*

Historical Parallels: Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic

Just look at the continuing existence of Ethereum Classic (ETC): it proves that old and unused chains can still have a price. Ethereum Classic, as the name suggests, was the original Ethereum.

After the DAO hack of 2016, Ethereum decided on a hard fork. All app development since, has happened on the new Ethereum chain, which we simply know as Ethereum. Still, ETC, the coin of the ‚Äòghost chain‚Äô Ethereum Classic, trades at 40 dollars.

A hard fork is like an airdrop to holders of the original token. For example, people that held Bitcoin before the Bitcoin Cash hard fork in 2017, would automatically be ‚Äòairdropped‚Äô a similar amount of Bitcoin Cash. They could opt to hold or immediately sell.

As can be seen from the below graph, hodlers of BCH were not rewarded: since 2017, BCH has lost 95% of its value in Bitcoin terms.

The price history of Ethereum Classic (ETC) versus ETH has a very similar look. ETC has even dumped faster.¬†

Implications of an Ethereum Fork Post-Merge

It is interesting to consider the intricacies of a fork. What happens in the background? Unlike the Bitcoin and Ethereum forks of the past, there is now a gigantic ecosystem of apps and tokens making use of the Ethereum blockchain.

If the miners continue to run the old chain, they will create a sort of parallel universe of sorts in which the Merge never happens. It will have the Ethereum-supported assets living on like ghost assets.

So in that science fiction sense, you will have twice the amount of USDC you owned before the Merge, and twice the amount of (Ethereum-based) NFT‚Äôs. But in practice, it won‚Äôt matter. The major players have signaled support for the POS chain.

For example, USDC, won‚Äôt recognize coins on the potential ‚Äòparallel universe twin USDCs‚Äô on the hard-forked POW chain as valid. The same goes for Chainlink, which has said it would not support any network that is a forked version of Ethereum.

*‚ÄúUsers should be aware that forked versions of the Ethereum blockchain, including PoW forks, will not be supported by the Chainlink protocol.‚Äù* 

So What is the Potential Trade?

After the Merge, all tokens on the POW chain will probably become worthless‚Ä¶ except the Ethereum POW coins themselves. After all, it will be a functioning chain that offers a real alternative to POS Ethereum, which has its vulnerabilities.

The trade is generally speaking to buy ETH, loan ETH and then try to get your hands on the POW Tokens. Remove any ETH on Layer 2‚Äôs to the Ethereum main chain. If you own staked ETH, which is locked, then loan ETH against staked ETH. Why? In both cases, the Layer 2‚Äôs nor the stETH will be forked and hence won‚Äôt get the ETH POW ‚Äòairdrop‚Äô.

So how do you get your hands on the ETH POW? There are two main ways. First, get them on centralized exchanges that recognize it. Second, buy them on decentralized exchanges.

1. ETH POW on Centralized Exchanges

If you want to trade a possible ETH POW coin, make sure you have an account on an exchange that will support the fork. As of now, we know the following exchanges will (this list could grow, of course):

* Poloniex
* BitMEX
* MEXC Global
* Gate.io
* OKX

2. ETH POW on Decentralized Exchanges

Another, more nerve-racking option would be to try to buy ETH POW on dexes like Curve or Uniswap. They might list the ETH POW tokens before cexes. It will possibly be a crowded trade, with liquidity pools that get drained of ETH POW right after the merge. See, that‚Äôs the irony: in order to dump ETH POW, first, everyone has to get their hands on it. This may lead to quite high prices.

3. ETH POW on the Futures Market

Another trade is the futures trade. BitMex has [listed ETHPOW futures](https://www.bitmex.com/app/trade/ETHPOWZ22). ETH POW has been trading in the 60 - 80 dollar range for a few weeks. No need to say that trading these futures is speculative. For a start, it isn‚Äôt even a certainty that the ETH POW token will exist at all.

Conclusion

For people who sit on the sidelines: get your popcorn, the markets after the Merge will be fun to watch. For those who want to trade: be careful out there. There are quite a few moving parts you‚Äôll have to manage. Be prepared to get in a dog fight with trading bots.

Firstly, moving your coins to a cex always comes with a slight risk. If your exchange doesn‚Äôt support the potential fork(s), you‚Äôll have to make an account on a different exchange, possibly one of lesser reputation.¬†

Second, always be aware of scammers that might want to lure you into fake trades.¬†

And to be clear: don‚Äôt expect the forked POW Ethereum to have lasting value. Even if the Merge won‚Äôt be an immediate technical success, issues will be fixed. In the long run, POW Ethereum will trend down in terms of ETH POS. The ETH POW token might spike to decent values though right after the Merge.¬†

Even though trading is fine, DON‚ÄôT INTERACT WITH THE HARD FORKED CHAIN. There is a danger of so-called replay attacks, meaning duplicate transactions on the POS chain. Imagine sending ETH POW to someone and them duplicating the same transaction in the POS chain! You will have sent your POS ETH without intending it.¬†

If you want to trade, be in for a rough ride immediately after the Merge. The first minutes and hours after the Merge, buying and selling ETH POW tokens will be a crowded trade. Probably, it will be easier for centralized exchanges (cexes) to handle the volumes than for dexes. On dexes, you will be troubled by spikes in gas fees."|0.84|9|0|9

My point of this title and post is that we often think ‚Äúis it too late? Did I miss the train?‚Äù and completely forget about the fact there billions of people (hundreds of millions if you want to be really conservative with estimations) that still don‚Äôt own crypto, and vast majority of those people don‚Äôt even know what crypto is to begin with.

More importantly, major companies and retailers still haven‚Äôt tapped into the market completely. Apple alone is said to make huge ripples in the crypto market if the rumors are true regarding them implementing crypto payments with their ApplePay.

We also still haven‚Äôt seen major adoption when it comes to blockchain courses in tech universities.

So far as I know there are a few universities like MIT and UBC that offer blockchain and Web3 related courses but those universities are accessible to everyone.

Some Web3 based organizations like BitDAO are also funding learning programs and organizations like EduDAO in order to help teach students how to become Web3 builders.

But on a macro scale, blockchain and Web3 are still extremely new and young concepts which professors, businessmen and regular people still haven‚Äôt caught up to.

I guess it‚Äôs easy to convince yourself that it is in fact too late since you haven‚Äôt been seeing the same green numbers and crazy profits you woke up to every day around a year and half ago, but don‚Äôt forget that bear markets are a necessity for a bull market to eventually emerge.

Once adoption start boosting is where you‚Äôll see the real profits. I myself am holding on for a long, long time."|0.89|20|0|20

Although the hype around her digital persona is already rock bottom, she has been quite impressive for a non-physical being. How did it lead to this and what awaits us in the future, assuming it hasn‚Äôt come already?

## What‚Äôs Web 3.0?

Throughout the past 30 years, the Internet has gradually entered three stages of its development: Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0. Here‚Äôs how they are different from each other.

### Web 1.0

Companies create content and sell information to the Internet users via the means of advertisement. Customers read what they find online, and the companies get money for it.

### Web 2.0

This is when global corporations stepped into the game. Social media platforms such as Meta get money from their users with the help of advertisement ‚Äî on this level, not much has changed. What‚Äôs different is that content is created by users instead of companies. Now, customers are both those who create and those who consume.

### Web 3.0

Applications, communities, and platforms are decentralized and belong to all the Internet users instead of just one company. Anyone could build a project, use it, and get money from it.

## What does it mean for crypto?

Metaverse already opened up plenty of new opportunities for the world of cryptocurrencies. In the future, we‚Äôll have to use crypto in order to buy digital assets and land in the metaverse, therefore increasing demand for crypto and its development.

GrayScale Investments claimed that the Web 3.0 metaverse industry will increase its annual profit up to $1 trillion. This number is higher than any other economic sector yet. Virtual platforms that use crypto, DeFi, NFT, and cloud storage technologies, attract much more users by creating new forms of integration with the real world.

## How will the metaverse affect us?

Creating the metaverse was a big step for humanity. People around the world take part in implementing their ideas into the virtual world with the help of state-of-the-art technologies that, thankfully, are known to us today.¬†

### Social experience

Metaverse will unite a lot of avatars ‚Äî some of them might be just artificial intelligence, others might be influential in the real world. We‚Äôll be able to meet new people and communicate with them in a way that will be much more lifelike than videochat. Avatars will allow us to express our feelings with facial expressions in the metaverse.

### Personalization

In fact, the metaverse will give us all the same opportunities as social media ‚Äî only at a much bigger scale. We‚Äôll be able to buy and sell land, build and obtain real estate, and change the digital world in any way possible.¬†

### Development

With the help of the metaverse, humanity will be able to create new communities, develop economies and the Internet without any boundaries. While the metaverse may seem like a twin of the real world at first, it might become a completely different place in the future, not limited by our expectations or imagination.

## What projects will we see in the meantime?

Developers spend a lot of time implementing their ideas into the virtual world. In the near future, we will see the rise of new projects that will change our perception of reality. Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit started investing into crypto to create new meta opportunities for their users. One of the most interesting Web3 social networks I‚Äôve seen recently is Raritygram. It‚Äôs a new project that will merge the concepts of social media, NFT marketplace, and blockchain on one platform. The project has already gained lots of support from crypto enthusiasts: over the first 24 hours of Raritygram Mint, users bought $100,000 worth of NFTRarity tokens.

I see all kinds of strategies on how to navigate this event being discussed, but they are scattered wildly across the board from super bear-ish to super bull-ish.

&amp;#x200B;

1. ""The merge is a risky software upgrade and could fail.  No reason to expose yourself to that, so you should sell now and buy back after its successful.""
2. ""You could get free forked coins with ETHPoW, so buy now and sell immediately after the fork.""
3. ""It's obviously a buy-the-rumor-sell-the-news event so buy now and sell just before the fork.""
4. ""Macro continues to look shitty.  Fed is still raising rates, Putin is still bombing people, and we're ankle deep in a recession.  You want to be far away from risk-on assets like ETH because it's only going to get worse.""
5. ""Fiat inflation is still super high, so holding USD is like lighting it on fire.""
6. ""ETH supply issuance is going to near zero (or less) with the merge. We know how BTC halvenings work, and this is a halvening on steroids. So buy now and hold while this price action plays out.""
7. ""Stakers are locked in until the next fork after the merge. You want to at least hold through all that and sell shortly before the Shanghai fork.""
8. ""It's a growth asset that essentially gives a 4-8% dividend (via staking).  This is a unicorn asset.   
 Just buy, hold, and stake forever.""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm personally split three ways between #4, #6, and #8.  I really like the setup for ETH over the next couple of years, but it feels like its going to coincide with a nasty recession.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Power consumption will drop 99.95%.  It will have no bearing on gas prices, but it is still a big deal.  We are now going to put the ETH in Ethical.  Bringing down the carbon footprint of ETH is not only something to feel good about, but will also silence the naysayers that despise Crypto for its environmental impact.
2. Daily ETH issued to Miners and Stakers will drop from 14,600 daily ETH to 1,600 daily ETH for stakers only.  (Source: [https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/issuance/](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/issuance/)) This reduces new issuances of ETH by 90%.  At least 1,600 daily ETH is burned daily bringing ETH to pretty much zero inflation.

This may not impact the price of ETH right away, but each day the selling pressure is potentially reduced by 13,000 ETH and at $1,500usd that‚Äôs $19,500,000 a day less of circulation.  Overtime this reduction of sell pressure should create more demand than supply and thus raising prices.

Obviously the current economic conditions will have an impact on price, however, because of these 2 changes to ETH, I believe that ETH will be stronger and better positioned for some serious ATH during the next bull run.

Next stop: shardding!

From automated market makers (AMMs), which allow users to trade digital assets in a permissionless way, to liquidity pools, where users can ‚Äúfarm‚Äù yield and enjoy high APYs, there are numerous ways to benefit from DeFi. 

However, before dabbling in this promising industry, let's understand some of its main components, how they work, and the risks associated with them.

**What Are AMMs?**

Automated market makers (AMMs) are decentralized trading pools that allow market participants to buy or sell cryptocurrencies in a permissionless and automatic way. AMMs have evolved to become one of the most popular DeFi applications as they power all decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

To better understand AMMs, it is important to know what market makers are. In traditional finance, market makers are liquidity providers that quote both a buy and a selling price in a tradable asset in the hope of making a profit on the bid-ask spread, or turn.

Banks and brokerage firms are the main market makers in TradFi. These are generally brick-and-mortar organizations that facilitate the process required to provide liquidity for trading pairs on centralized exchanges. Some of the biggest market makers are names familiar to everyone, including Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, and more. 

Since traditional market makers are controlled by centralized entities, they have full control over their operations. This also gives them the power to manipulate markets to their own benefit. For instance, a market maker may buy shares of a company for their own accounts and then flip them hours later for a profit. 

To tackle this issue, DeFi has given birth to AMMs. Leveraging blockchain technology and the power of smart contracts, a set of programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met, AMMs automate the process of providing liquidity for trading pairs, removing the need for centralized entities and also making trades more efficient and transparent. 

AMMs are a crucial part of DeFi as they power all DEXes. Instead of using an order book like centralized exchanges (CEXes), DEXes use AMMs, which in turn utilize smart contracts to define the price of cryptocurrencies and provide liquidity. 

Technically, DEX users do not trade against counterparties, rather they are trading against the liquidity locked inside smart contracts. These smart contracts are often called liquidity pools. Examples of AMMs include Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve.

**What Are Liquidity Pools?**

Liquidity pools are piles of digital assets locked in a smart contract that provide essential liquidity to DEXes. As noted above, liquidity pools are an essential part of AMMs, and one of the foundational technologies behind the current DeFi ecosystem.

To better understand liquidity pools, it is important to know liquidity first. In simple terms, liquidity is when assets are converted to cash quickly and efficiently, avoiding sharp price swings. Therefore, it is easy to see that liquidity is an essential part of both the crypto and financial markets.

If an asset is illiquid, either in TradFi or DeFi, it takes some time to convert it to cash or other liquid assets. During this period, users could also face slippage, which is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed, and thus end up with less cash than first anticipated. 

In TradFi, banks, financial institutions, principal trading firms (PTFs), and other organizations provide liquidity. However, since DeFi aims to undercut centralized entities, it uses liquidity pools to gather liquidity. 

Unlike TradFi, where high-net-worth clients can only provide liquidity, all DeFi users can become liquidity providers as long as they meet the requirements hardcoded into the smart contracts of different AMMs. Users who provide liquidity are called liquidity providers (LPs)

In order to incentivize LPs, liquidity pools in DeFi offer rewards in exchange for the amount of liquidity they supply. This reward is usually a fraction of the fees a DEX or an AMM generates and is distributed in the form of the protocol‚Äôs native token. These tokens can then be used in different ways or simply traded for cash.

**What is Yield farming?**

DeFi is replete with money-making opportunities that enable users to put their cryptocurrencies at work and generate income. One such strategy is yield farming, which is the process of lending or borrowing crypto on a DeFi platform in exchange for cryptocurrencies.

To incentivize LPs to stake or lock up their crypto assets, yield farming protocols offer high rewards that can be a percentage of transaction fees, interest from lenders, or their governance tokens. These returns are expressed as an annual percentage yield (APY).

The APY rate of a yield farming protocol is proportionate to the total value of staked assets. As more investors lock up their funds in a liquidity pool, the value of its issued returns decreases. On the other hand, when investors start pulling out their funds, the APY rate increases in order to attract new stakers and increase liquidity.

Initially, yield farmers were able to stake their assets and earn rewards. However, with the prominence of so-called liquidity mining, which enables yield farmers to get a new token as well as the usual return, yield farming became even more powerful and attractive.

Liquidity mining became popular after Compound started issuing its governance token COMP to its platform users. At the time, Compound gained huge traction by bolstering the returns on deposits to its lending platform with COMP token rewards. The skyrocketing value of COMP made this program even more attractive. 

**What is Impermanent loss?**

Yield farming in DeFi offers the opportunity to earn high returns, but it also comes with some risks. Apart from the obvious risks of hacks and exploitations, there is also an impermanent loss in yield farming. 

Impermanent loss refers to the fact that the USD value of the withdrawal from yield farming is lower than the dollar value of the deposit. That can happen if the value of the cryptocurrency that a user locks plunges. For instance, if a user stakes 2 ETH when the ethereum price is at $4,000 and withdraws when the price is at $2,000, they have incurred an impermanent loss.

As the name implies, this loss is impermanent because no loss happens if the cryptocurrencies recover their losses (i.e., return to the same price when they were deposited on the AMM). Furthermore, the reward liquidity providers receive can help offset the risk exposure to impermanent loss.

It is important to note that liquidity providers cannot avoid impermanent loss on volatile cryptocurrencies like ETH. However, they can avoid temporary losses by choosing stablecoin pairs that offer the best bet against impermanent loss since they are mostly stable. 

**AMMs, Liquidity Pools in CeDeFi Strategies**

[Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/), the first CeDeFi custodial platform that serves as a gateway between DeFi and CeFi, uses strategies that combine working with digital assets and various protocols to create profitable intuitive investment tools. Some of these strategies make use of AMMs and liquidity pools to offer users high returns.

For instance, Midas.Investments has recently revealed three new ‚ÄúCeDeFi‚Äù strategies aimed to create new opportunities for Midas users during the current bear market. One of these strategies, called DeFi Token Farming, is a basket of incentivized liquidity pools with DeFi tokens on popular AMMs (like Curve) that can generate up to 35% ROI.

The DeFi Token Farming strategy uses top-tier liquidity pools in all of DeFi, each of which includes incentivized rewards from Convex. Convex is a platform for CRV token holders and Curve liquidity providers to earn additional interest rewards and represents the primary source of the strategy‚Äôs yield. 

Notably, the other two CeDeFi strategies use Alpha Homora, a leveraged yield farming product, to create leveraged positions on a basket of ETH-Stable liquidity pools. Called ‚ÄúSoft Long on ETH‚Äù and ‚ÄúSoft Short on ETH,‚Äù the strategies aim to generate 45% ROI and 25% ROI through price movements of ETH and rewards for providing liquidity. 

Midas.Investments is a custodial CeDeFi platform seeking to bridge the gap between CeFi and DeFi, combining the former‚Äôs reliability with the latter‚Äôs high profitability. The platform implements a strict risk management policy and mandatory audits of all products in a bid to enhance security and transparency standards while reducing the possibility of fraud."|0.89|14|0|14

I read some articles and I was quite shocked, so do you still believe after all of this that cryptocurrency games are innocent fun? Or are they Ponzi schemes facing an imminent crackdown by regulators in the United States?   
 

So, tokens related to cryptocurrency games - known colloquially as ‚ÄúGameFi"", were worth a cumulative total of nearly $10 billion as of mid-August, give or take a few billion.   
 

In this way, the legality of the games is a $10 billion issue that few investors have thought about. So, is this a mistake they might come to regret? Should this mean that game devs may bear responsibility? Will consequences become fines, registration, and disclosures?   
 

All of this is happening even though crypto gaming is surely becoming one of the most playable types of games and so many people started adopting these games or even developing them or NFT stores in games through Altura and other tools. So many people are into these games this way or another.    
 

Penalties that game developers could face may vary depending on how lenient SEC officials feel. At the very minimum, developers will be required to follow the same disclosure laws by which public companies in the U.S. abide.    
 

Beyond unforeseen legal ramifications, developers face a more apparent problem: a rapidly diminishing user base. Axie Infinity would be a great example of that.

It seems though that to move my ETH off of RH I need to actually sell and rebuy somewhere else. That seems‚Ä¶. Bad.

t3_x05b8q|1661718755|ethtrader|If retail companies ever end up accepting crypto payments, it will most likely be stablecoins and nothing more|"The reason I‚Äôm saying this is cause the vast majority of cryptocurrencies are volatile. And that‚Äôs what gives crypto its value, the volatility that comes along with it through leverage and spot trading.

Major retail companies like Walmart, Costco and other similar companies with tens of millions of dollars in daily revenues would suffer VERY harsh consequences if a good portion of their revenue was in ETH for example and then ETH goes from 4k to 2k in a matter of months.

That would be catastrophic and would cause them billions of dollars in losses.

These giant companies LOVE stability more than anything else and so it wouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise if they chose stablecoins as their main crypto payment opinion.

In fact we‚Äôre already starting to see that with some companies. Travala is already accepting USDC through Polygon right now (which is a great thing cause I think travel is exactly where near instantaneous long distance crypto payments shine the most). Also Stripe uses Polygon for their crypto payments as well. I think they‚Äôre the something like the 6th largest Fintech company in the world is that‚Äôs a huge step for crypto in the right direction.

**But most importantly,** Apple is rumored to be implementing crypto payments in their new Apple Cash wallet (apparently Crypto com has already jumped in on the action).

I do think that sometime later in the very far future, retail companies will be accepting crypto payments of all kind. However, for the meantime, I think its a long shot to assume that they‚Äôll be accepting anything other than stablecoins especially seeing how the market tanked real hard the past 6-9 months."|0.83|22|0|22
t3_x053li|1661718202|ethtrader|GameFi will gain A LOT from the Ethereum merge.|"The main reason I‚Äôm saying this is because of gas fees. And while the merge itself won‚Äôt reduce gas fees, sharding will do that indeed

The merge is considered the precursor to sharding where Ethereum moves to the new beacon chain and new upgrades can be implemented there without having to cause any stoppage to the blockchain and its transactions.

One of the most important of those upgrades will be sharding because its going to give L2s scaling solutions huge boost in performance.

GameFi is indeed fun and all but its also very expensive as all Ethereum based DeFi applications are on Ethereum.

With sharding implemented however, this won‚Äôt be the case anymore

Layer 2 scaling solution will make GameFi much much cheaper to all users on Ethereum.

In fact there are already some companies and projects taking advantage of the high efficiency of scaling solutions like how GameStop is working with Immutable X and Loopring

Other organizations like BitDAO are working with Zksync to create a DAO specific scaling solution called zkDAO which will most definitely help them scale GameFi projects like Game7 which they‚Äôre also working with to create new NFT games.

The hype around GameFi is indeed real and its all going to get better and better after the merge is implemented.

By mid 2023 when sharding is complete rolled out, GameFi will see a major boost just like the Axie Infinity days.

Considering the power the L2s already have right now (which by the way is increasing exponentially each day), sharding will turn them into a monster of processing and validation.

Its not just GameFi that will benefit, but honestly GameFi is one of the major things I‚Äôm very excited about."|0.58|2|0|2

t3_wzuu7y|1661691327|ethtrader|Can Web3 gaming guilds STOP only focusing on earning? All we need is a supportive community|"I just joined Web3 and found crypto gaming communities are quite different from traditional ones (Web2). Web2 games are fairly accessible and simple to play, but when it comes to Web3, I encountered quite a lot of difficulties involved with blockchain &amp; crypto jargon (scholarships, gas fee, token &amp; wallets etc. -- MIND BLOWN) ‚Ä¶ and all those different wallets and gas fees just to get started. I'm hoping that Web3 gaming guilds can help me better understand the infrastructure, but most of them fall short of my expectations... let alone improving my gaming experience

&amp;#x200B;

A common vibe in many Web3 gaming guilds: managers only care about recruiting contributive scholars and their performance, i.e. how many profits one can make, how engaged a gamer is‚Ä¶ (they manage gamers as if they were full-time employees lmao) Completely understand some people are treating games as a source of income or even a career opportunity, but I feel like playing games should be something entertaining and STRESS-FREE, even if it‚Äôs crypto game that involves earning. Or don't say stress-free, but at least a community where we can enjoy the gaming part, rather than everyone being demanding and pushy and just focused on the earnings. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tho I‚Äôm sick of this ‚ÄúENERGY‚Äù, m still hopeful of finding a helpful community. Looked at some communities with less aggressive vibe: Fitchin is a gaming platform that combines crypto, games and esports, but members in their English channel are not active at all:/ (saw them talking in their Spanish channel, sad that I can‚Äôt read their language) Earn Alliance has a lot more interactions, not just about gaming, but they also chitchat about everything. I like how clear-cut their channel divisions are (talk food in food channel, pets in pets channel) so it doesn‚Äôt sidetrack convo. It‚Äôll be great if they can also share more game tips.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggested Web3 gaming communities please? 

P.S. I speak English &amp; Filipino"|0.96|25|0|25

* Basically, I believe it is possible to buy eth on spot
* Sell eth futures 
* gain the new coin as a profit

Anyone doing this would have reason to push the new coin and try and make it as valuable as possible. This would also explain why we are seeing such negative funding fees on the futures.

I wrote about it in more detail in [this substack](https://thecryptofool.substack.com/p/if-it-is-possible-and-profitable) but it is still just a theory.

I am not seeing nearly as much talk about a split as there was back in the ETC days, is that because I am in a bubble or is there not much of a push for it?"|0.5|0|0|0

So this Eth fork will always be the most advanced version of Ethereum. What made me first think of this was while I looked at the Eth Pow (proof of work) fork I was thinking it was going in a backwards direction of tech. And then I started to think of a fork that could go in a more progressive forward direction. While other forks will continue to use outdated tech this fork will be the one that's always ahead of everything else. Even the ""Official"" Ethereum would benefit from something that uses its future upgrades in a mainnet environment instead of the current model of only testnets doing so.

The merge is obviously coming up, we could create a POS fork and make it live in the next couple days before it goes live on the ""Official"" Ethereum at the end of September. This would only be a couple weeks of lead time but this is just the start. We could fork to Sharding way before it goes live on the official Ethereum possibly months earlier. Continuing down this line of always having the most advanced version of Ethereum will make the fork very useful since their is things our fork will be able to do that no other version of Ethereum will be capable of.

There is definitely value in upgrading to future version of Ethereum in a mainnet environment before the official Ethereum does. It's up to the community and market to decide how high that value is. So is a fork like this something that you would be interested in?"|0.5|0|0|0

I wasn‚Äôt originally into exploring things and just sticking to what I know but, my amazing friends that are into crypto as well made me realize how boring I was. Ever since then, I‚Äôm trying to be not afraid on taking risks and getting out of my comfort zone. So far, I have tried NFTs, P2es, and Metaverses, and now, I just started reading about automated trading bots because I can see myself using them. Here are some of the bots I came across during my research but I am not sure if it's worth investing my time and money

Peccala -  Peccala is a hands-off cryptocurrency trading bot that requires no expertise or time to use because it is entirely automated. Their in-house trading algorithms manage money round-the-clock. Basically, you only need to pay a performance fee if you earn a profit; otherwise, they won't charge you.

Trality -  Trality is a platform that allows anyone to create and invest using automated crypto trading bots by essentially providing access to the cutting-edge tools they need to either automate their own strategies or follow those on the platform who are already doing so with a variety of fair and flexible packages for different levels of users.

Kucoin -  The Cryptorobotics trading platform features the KuCoin trading bot. It is a computer program that automatically carries out buy and sell orders in accordance with specified market circumstances. By reducing the risks, this bot can raise the likelihood that cryptocurrency trading will be profitable.

I am looking for a bot I can get reliable trades without some fault occurring from the side of the system. Does anyone have a first-hand experience tested with time where using the bots is actually better than simply holding?"|1.0|118|0|118
