t3_xcsubz|1663028724|stocks|Is the “rule of 20” valuation model dead/outdated?|"
I work at a FX trading desk at a multinational, I am hardly a newcomer to Financial markets in general, I am sure as heck no expert in equity though.

FX markets have traded as if blood was in the water for the global economy for the better part of this year. They’re right to an extent, and weighted how events have transpired this year the US equity markets have done pretty well relative to the boom in USD. 

I’d really like an expert opinion, but since 2018 US markets have generally traded above 20PE, and above 25 since 2020. Now with the rule of 20, I obviously don’t think the S&amp;P should be trading at a 12, but 5y breakevens are still well above 2, so this market seems really expensive in that light of valuation; so rationally, you know maybe put a 17.5 multiple and give it 75BP of discount for a 16.75, that by that metric, that would probably be fairly valued. With anything above it being a premium and anything below it being a discount.

So is the rule of 20 dead? The S&amp;P trades 21, so obviously that value of valuation is not being taken into account in this market. Some hedge funds have shorted this market, thinking this exact line and have been blown out of the water.

Maybe I answered my own question, but if there’s someone who is knowledgeable in equity and the history of equity in US markets, what did it? Or at least what do you think did it? In the mid 2010s that kind of drove valuations up? The dominance of tech?

I’m actually not trying to be a bear or a bull. I’m actually trying to start investing in my own personal long term equity portfolio. And as an investor, I would say value is important to me, one of the most important things to me and I have a hard time paying the multiples that the market is asking for.

Every single rule/indicator/equation drilled into a finance students brain, the Graham number, 1.5 rule, buffet indicator have been completely defied by this new wave of investing. None exist, and I just question that maybe the valuation metrics of the past are just no longer applicable, not that the market is overvalued.

I genuinely do believe we are still at the ""early adoption"" phase of EVs and will likely only see a massive increase in their presence over the next two decades. Here are just a few reasons I believe so:

* [17 States Weigh Adopting California's EV Mandate - AP News](https://apnews.com/article/technology-california-clean-air-act-vehicle-emissions-standards-eebb48c13e24835f2c5b9cb56796182a)

* U.S. Infrastructure Bill and Inflation Reduction Act will direct billions into EV development and charging infrastructure (too lazy to link, but a quick Google search will get you the exact estimates).

I'm personally not a fan of hyper-speculative companies or ETFs with crazy-high fees, but I'm curious to hear what people here are betting on.

With the above in mind, what do you think are some good stocks or ETFs for the longer-term EV play?

t3_xc7my2|1662972649|stocks|Activist investor Dan Loeb steps back from his push for Disney to sell ESPN|" Activist investor Dan Loeb signaled Sunday morning on Twitter that he is backing off his push to persuade Walt Disney Co. to spin off its popular sports television network ESPN.

The change of heart comes after Disney’s DIS, +2.54% Chief Executive Bob Chapek said in media interviews at this weekend’s D23 Expo event — an annual gathering of Disney fans where the company announces new shows and films — that he has plans for ESPN to be a big growth engine and a large part of the company’s entertainment offerings.

“As Bob has said, ESPN is an integral part of The Walt Disney Company, and he believes that its full potential will continue to be realized as we execute against our strategic vision for the most trusted brand in sports,” said Disney spokeswoman Kristina Schake on Sunday.

Last month, Loeb’s hedge fund Third Point LLC announced that it had renewed its stake in Disney stock after having liquidated one earlier this year. He sent a letter to Chapek asking for major changes to Disney’s business, including spinning off ESPN, refreshing Disney’s board and cutting spending.

“We have a better understanding of ESPN’s potential as a stand-alone business and another vertical for \[Disney\] to reach a global audience to generate ad and subscriber revenues,” Loeb wrote on Twitter Sunday morning. “We look forward to seeing \[ESPN chief James\] Pitaro execute on the growth and innovation plans, generating considerable synergies as part of The Walt Disney company.”

The Commerce Department intends to publish new regulations based on restrictions communicated in letters earlier this year to three U.S. companies — KLA, Lam Research and Applied Materials, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The plan for new rules has not been previously reported. The letters, which the companies publicly acknowledged, forbade them from exporting chipmaking equipment to Chinese factories that produce advanced semiconductors with sub-14 nanometer processes unless the sellers obtain Commerce Department licenses. The rules would also codify restrictions in Commerce Department letters sent to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices last month instructing them to halt shipments of several artificial intelligence computing chips to China unless they obtain licenses.

So-called “is informed” letters allow the Commerce Department to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to put controls in place quickly, but the letters only apply to the companies that receive them. Turning the letters into rules would broaden their reach and could subject other U.S. companies producing similar technology to the restrictions. The regulations could potentially apply to companies trying to challenge Nvidia and AMD’s dominance in artificial intelligence chips. Intel and startups like Cerebras Systems are targeting the same advanced computing markets. Intel said it is closely monitoring the situation, while Cerebras declined to comment.

One source said the rules could also impose license requirements on shipments to China of products that contain the targeted chips. Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer make data center servers that contain Nvidia’s A100 chip. Dell and HPE said they were monitoring the situation, while Super Micro Computer did not respond to a request for comment.

This week, it's Intuit, a company that is loved by many for its great product portfolio and amazing share price performance, crushing the S&amp;P500 in the last decade.

As always, the post will be divided into a few segments:

1. Understanding the business
2. Understanding the historical financial performance
3. Laying down some assumptions to value the company
4. Valuing the company based on assumptions significantly different than mine

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Intuit? - Understanding the business**

In a nutshell, it is a software company that is specializing in financial software. This was accurate, until recently, as they've acquired MailChimp, although it is a great fit within their product offering, it is a CRM software.

The main products that they own are:

\- Quickbooks (An accounting package)

\- Turbotax (package for the preparation of US income tax returns)

\- Mint (personal finance management tool)

\- Credit Karma (Acquired during their 2021 fiscal year)

\- Mailchimp (Acquired during their 2022 fiscal year)

&amp;#x200B;

The fiscal year of Intuit starts on August 1st and ends on July 31st. I'm mentioning this as their 2022 numbers are already out to avoid confusion about how that's possible mid-year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

The company has crushed all expectations over the last 5 years, revenue has grown from $6b in 2018 to $12,7b in 2022 (Average revenue growth of 21%).

In most companies, there was a dip in 2020/2021 due to the impact of the pandemic. However, that was not the case at all when it comes to Intuit due to the nature of their products.

For example, if there's a small business, that has 30% less revenue in a given year, it has to cut certain expenditures. However, having bookkeeping software is a must. Regardless if there are 100 or 1,000 transactions, as long as a business is running, there will be demand for Quickbooks. The demand would decrease only in two cases:

1. Businesses go bankrupt, hence there's no need to have bookkeeping software anymore.
2. There's another product with better quality, that's cheaper.

As for individuals, if someone earned 30% less money during the pandemic, they still need to file their tax return, hence, the demand for Turbotax remains high.

So, we have high-retention products, most of them subscription-based. The gross margin has been over 82% which is amazing.

The rest of the operating expenses have been fixed as % of revenue over time (roughly 56%) and do not fluctuate significantly. So, Intuit has been growing and the operating expenses have been growing at the same pace.

Hence, the operating margin has been stable between 26 and 29% during the last 5 years.

The free cash flow that is being generated a year is below $3b (I am not adding back the share-based compensation in the FCF calculation).

&amp;#x200B;

The size of their balance sheet has grown significantly, from $5b at the end of their fiscal year 2018, to $27,7b as of 2022! This is primarily due to their acquisitions as the goodwill + the other intangible assets acquired account for $19b of the difference.

Part of the acquisition was funded by debt, so at the end of 2022, their debt position (excluding leases) was around $7b. Although this is a significant increase compared to 2018 when the debt was less than $400m, this is still fairly low for a company with a market cap of $127b.

The excess cash that the company generates over time is being returned to the shareholder, partly via the dividend (0.69% dividend yield, I know, a great number) and partly via share buybacks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumptions about the future &amp; valuation**

The management is guiding for revenue growth of between 14-16% for the next 12 months and analysts are expecting similar growth for the year after that.

As for the operating margin, based on the historical performance, it is quite clear that it is settled between 25% - 30%.

My assumptions:

**- Revenue growth** of 14% for the next year, followed by 12% up until year 5, and then slowly decrease to the risk-free rate of 3.32%. The market that they're after is not one that's significantly growing, so the organic growth cannot be there for a long period of time.

**- Operating margin** of 25% for the next year, increasing to 29% over time. After the two acquisitions, it takes a bit of time to identify the synergies and reduce costs, some of them being driven by duplication of roles.

**- A discount rate of 8.9%** (WACC-based)

Based on these assumptions, the fair value of the company is $54,3b (**$192.6/share**)

The current market cap is $126.85b ($450/share)

*Note: I have taken into account the cash, debt, and deferred taxes on their balance sheet as well as the outstanding equity options.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on the assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 149% to $31,7b in 10 years and the operating margin will be 29%.

I am aware that my assumptions could be significantly wrong. So, let's take a look at how the value of the company (per share) will change based on different assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin: 

&amp;#x200B;

The table illustrates how much the company needs to grow and how high should the operating margin be so that Intuit is fairly valued today. 

The management has done a great job, I really like the products and I would love to own Intuit. But at today's share price, it is over 2x what is fair value based on my assumptions.

The only decision that I'm not a big fan of is the share buyback decision. If this activity is being performed when the shares are overvalued, it destroys wealth for the remaining shareholders. Vice-versa, when the share price is undervalued, buying back shares creates value.

What are your thoughts on Intuit, its products, and its valuation?"|0.61|13|0|13

t3_xbif69|1662902459|stocks|InPost SA (INPST) - analysis &amp; why I think it's a great opportunity for huge growth over the next years|"Hello,

I wanted to start a discussion about [InPost](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INPST.AS?p=INPST.AS) - most likely not many people here know about this company yet as Reddit is mostly American, so here are some details &amp; my analysis. **Disclaimer**: I love the company and I am investing in InPost regardless - I am not asking for advice, just wanted to start a discussion.


InPost provides delivery services through its network of automated parcel machines as well as to-door couriers and fulfillment services to e-commerce merchants. Established in Poland in 2006, where 2/3 of online shoppers use lockers. 

So, most of their business is focused on their [parcel lockers](https://www.parcelworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/InPost-UK-Parcel-Lockers-in-situe.jpg). They are the absolute leader in this segment in Poland - over 18000 lockers in the entire country, and thanks to InPost, Poland has the largest worldwide number of automated parcel machines (APMs) per 100,000 inhabitants.

48% adults in Poland use InPost's services. 58% of them have an InPost locker within a 7-minute walk; 47% within only a 5-minute walk.

**The price** for their delivery services is about 10pln ($2), which is cheaper than traditional to-door services, although most big stores/platforms offer deliveries to InPost's parcel lockers for free.

**Competitors**: domestically mostly Orlen and Allegro, only have about 1000-2000 lockers each. Nowhere near InPost. Late to the party. Also Orlen is not trusted by the vast majority of consumers due to it being a state-owned company.

**Competitive advantage**: 

- 99% of packages are delivered on the next day,

- the number of lockers virtually everywhere in the country - in 2021 InPost had 45% of all collection points in Poland (this includes for example stores which accept deliveries as a side-business),

- contracts with major e-commerce platforms, 

- they are universally loved and trusted in the country. People generally prefer having their package delivered to a locker that's 5 minutes away than to be locked at home for the entire day awaiting the delivery. They are faster than competition as well and often deliver on weekends.

- the market for parcel lockers is not saturated in countries other than Poland, so the possibilities for growth are insane. They are capitalizing on it.

**Growth:**

- deliveries to parcel machines already account for almost 40% of all deliveries in Poland, and by 2024 this number will be equal to the market share for home deliveries. 

- almost 15.7 million people in Poland have more than 10 minutes of walk to the nearest parcel collection point or a parcel machine of any company. It means that there is still room for development and new devices and collection points in Poland.

- they are increasing their volumes even when the market goes down.  In Q1 2022 their marketshare in Poland increased by 16%. In UK, even though the market shrunk by 20%, InPost's volumes increased by 157%. In France, InPost's volumes increased by 8% while the market shrunk by 16%.

- InPost Fresh: their new service which provides grocery deliveries from supermarkets to their parcel lockers or to-door. 

- new lockers operated only through their mobile app. Cheaper to manufacture than their previous ones with large touch screens, saves energy as well. 9.6M people use their app.

- most importantly in my opinion, their plans to expand internationally. They doubled the number of their lockers in the UK this year - to 4000.  They took over Mondial Relay in France and have placed 1000 lockers so far in 9 months. According to CEO Rafał Brzoska, there is even more demand for their services in France than in Poland. They are also introducing InPost in Spain and Portugal.

- Q2 2022 was record breaking for the company. Increased income by 97.8%, EBITDA up by 41% and 73% more delivered packages. 225% more in the UK alone after introducing label-less returns. Increased marketshare in all locations despite market shrinking.


I am invested because I have used their services for a few years now, and I think they will grow to be the leader internationally as well. The share price is 6.49 EUR right now, up by 9.43% last month. Down by 57.09% since last year. I bought at 5.87 EUR."|0.77|40|0|40

Edit: People keep saying the same thing and I'm repeating myself in comments so I'll just put it here.

&amp;nbsp;

I know I will lose money.


I would not be using my savings. I would be using bonus money I make from side hustles in my free time. I will be using any money I can't afford to lose. I genuinely don't understand why people do that. I'm far too afraid of not being able to live to ever dream of doing such a thing.


I already have an ISA for investing and fully intend to keep on investing and learning more on investing.


I am wanting to learn how to trade stocks because I am finding it hugely enjoyable and fascinating to learn about. I do not plan on becoming a professional trader. I plan to continue becoming a nurse. If I make any money that's a bonus.


I will not be spending any money any time soon on trading stocks. I am looking to just use simulations right now to further learn and understand how everything works. I understand, and agree with, the fact emotion can fuck stuff up that doesn't happen on simulations. Any money I would use towards this is Money I've already decided I have lost. I also have the benefit of autism on my side and am pretty emotionally shut off in general. Makes working in emergency situations etc. as a nurse really easy. Also makes making friends really hard hence why I have this extra money to spend as I don't go out!"|0.86|88|0|88
t3_xauf1j|1662829540|stocks|Which Investments Will Benefit Most from 'De-Globalization'?|"It's now being said that de-globalization is the new trend. Which stocks, industries, countries will benefit most from this, as investment targets?

What would 'de-globalization' look like? What's driving this trend? Is this trend really about 'de-globalization', or is it just about de-coupling from China &amp; Russia? Arguably, China &amp; Russia have been big beneficiaries of globalization, especially China which has made itself the world's factory. If the new 'de-globalization' trend is really about de-coupling from China &amp; Russia, then they would be expected to lose from it.

We're hearing newer words beyond 'near-shoring' -- words or phrases like 'friend-shoring', etc. How can such criteria be quantified? Earnings reports and forecasts can show objective criteria like earnings, revenues, profitability, etc. But how do companies, industries, national economies demonstrate 'friendliness'? Is this a purely political and subjective term? Can it be used to influence investors? Or will the 'friend-shoring' trend be a purely regulatory effect, driven by regulations?

There have been metrics and standards created for ESG (Environmental Social Governance), and so can we expect new metrics and standards to be created for 'friendliness'? Who gets to create and set these metrics and standards? Will this be done apolitically, or will it be an entirely political exercise?

Will there be universal buy-in, adherence and compliance? If not, then how can we expect this trend to progress or succeed? Or will this trend just fizzle out?"|0.48|0|0|0
t3_xatv34|1662828125|stocks|Will lose access to buying US stocks, asking for advice|"I’m Russian, currently living there as well. The Russian national bank recently announced that next month they will cut access to buying stocks from “unfriendly” countries for “unqualified investors"". To get a ""qualified investor"" status you need econ higher education or more than 6 mln rubles portfolio, that's $100k. I'm not close to that yet. Selling will be allowed.

Their stated reasons are infrastructural risks with western financial institutions like Euroclear that could freeze our assets at any moment. And this is true, they already froze some parts of Russian portfolios, including mine (I got away only with having a tiny bit of TAL locked lol). I still disagree with the bank’s decision because I’m willing to take a risk, but whatever, they don’t think I’m qualified, and I can understand that. They don't want to deal with a bunch of retail investors crying to them demanding to return money.

So, my portfolio is basically 40%/30% RU+CN/Western papers, 15% gold and silver, and bit of RU bonds. My plan is to sell gold (and maybe eat a -7% on silver too) and around half or more of my Russian and Chinese stocks, most of which are in the green, throw this money at “unfriendly” stocks I like, and then maybe slowly restore my sold Russian positions while beginning to invest in ETFs on Western markets — yes, those will be available. But I haven’t researched the commissions Russian funds take and their terms yet.

I have a high risk tolerance and am in a decent financial position to forget about that money for a long time. Would you do something different? What stocks would you pick now if you had this choice in a situation where DCA isn't possible? I have my ideas to research, but interested in what others think."|0.85|769|0|769

Date: 5th January 2018

**Abstract**

The paper provides evidence for the existence of a midterm election effect on the US equity market. By examining the quarterly total returns on the S&amp;P 500 Index between 1954 and 2017, we show that, **nine times out of 10, the index has been positive in the fourth quarter of a midterm election year and the following two quarters.** This compounds to nearly 25% in those three quarters. Neither changes in the monetary nor the fiscal policies were able to explain the effect. Moreover, the authors show that the known third year of a presidential term effect is weaker than the examined midterm election effect. Our results are robust for selection time period."""|0.65|4|0|4
t3_xamciq|1662806943|stocks|What stocks should I sell?|"Hello everyone!

I am here for some trading advice of you. My situation is as follows: 

I am about to buy a house. To get a bank loan with decent interest rates I need to bring in alot of my own money. That is why I want to sell atleast a quarter or even half of my stocks. My depot consists of several Etf's and maybe two dozen single stocks. Some of my stocks did really well (like 80% - 150% gains) and some of my stocks did poorly (like 5% - 30% losses). I try to buy only ""good"" companies, so the reason for most of my stocks that did poorly are because I bought them at a bad timing (like at the ATH right before the current bear market). So I expect most of them to eventually get back up in the long run. Admittedly some stocks are just high risk, for example hydrogen companies like Plug Power. I dont know if they will ever rise again to their previous ATH or die out. 

So as of right know I am unsure whether I should sell the stocks that are currently at a profit or the one that are currently at a loss.  At the one hand I dont wanna lock in my losses with stocks that I expect to get back up again. On the other side my profitable stocks will hopefully also keep rising and I dont want to keep only ""losing"" stocks in my depot. But I would potentially get more money by selling less stocks if I sell my gainers. However I have to pay taxes on my gains if I sell my profitable stocks. 

What do you guys think? Should I sell my winning or my losing positions or a mix of both to finance my future home?

Robinhood Markets is launching an index to track the favorite stocks of its millions of predominantly young, social-media-savvy customers. The brokerage firm’s new “Robinhood Investor Index” will track the performance of the 100 investments most popular among its user base. Initially, the top five stocks in the index will be Tesla , Apple, Amazon.com, Ford Motor and meme-stock favorite AMC Entertainment Holdings. Robinhood said it would update the composition of the index monthly, offering a view into its customers’ changing tastes. In an unusual approach to constructing an index, Robinhood said it would weight stocks in the index by the “conviction” customers have in them, defined as the percentage of assets in a customer's portfolio devoted to a particular stock. 

That means that if many Robinhood users devote a large part of their portfolio to one stock, it would rank higher in the index, even if those users' holdings were relatively small. Robinhood tends to have less-affluent customers, with smaller accounts, than other brokerages.

Robinhood has experimented with sharing such data before. During the early months of the pandemic, it released hourly data on the popularity of stocks among its customers, which were aggregated by the third-party website Robintrack.net. The site became a popular way to track retail-investor activity until Robinhood shut off the data feed in August 2020, citing concerns that its data could be “misconstrued or misunderstood.”"|0.89|576|0|576

&gt; # The Midterm Election Is Two Months Away. What Investors Need To Know

&gt; First things first, the Carson Investment Research team would like to send our condolences to the Queen’s family, and all of our friends in the UK. We lost a great one yesterday and the world is a better place because of her.

&gt; Midterm elections are right around the corner, as this week marked two months from the always important election. Although this year investors have been more worried about inflation, the war, the economy, and the stock market than the election, one thing that is playing out once again is midterm years tend to be volatile.

&gt; # The Calendar
&gt; As our first chart shows, the average midterm year since 1950 corrected 17.1% on average, the most out of the four-year presidential cycle. That’s the bad news, the good news is stocks gained 32.3% on average a year off those lows and have never been lower. Although we don’t know if June 16 is officially the lows or not, there could be a lot of opportunity for bulls over the coming year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-1-Midterm.png))**

&gt; Here’s another look at the same thing, but breaking it down by each year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-2-Midterm.png))**

&gt; Should we be surprised that stocks have had a tough go so far in 2022? Maybe not, as this next chart shows the worst time for stocks is a midterm year under a new President. With the S&amp;P 500 up only 2.4% on average these years, it helps put the disappointing year so far into perspective. Now check out what happens the following year, which might be something many investors could be smiling about soon enough.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-3-Midterm.png))**

&gt; Here’s one more look at how stocks do based on the calendar. Below we’ve broken returns down by each quarter out of a 4-year presidential cycle. Sure enough, the first three quarters of a midterm year are historically quite weak, some of the worst out of the entire cycle actually. Once again though, we are on the cusp of some of the strongest quarters coming up and investors need to take notice of the positive seasonality right around the corner.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-4-Midterm.png))**

&gt; # What About The Election?
&gt; Historically the party that loses the election is the motivated party and they tend to gain seats in the House and Senate. In fact, since World War I, the winning party lost nearly 30 seats on average at the first midterm election. FDR during the Great Depression and George W. Bush (post-9/11) are the only two instances when the President’s party gained seats in the House.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-5-Midterm.png))**

&gt; Please don’t shoot the messenger here, but President Biden’s approval ratings have been among the worst ever at this point of a new Presidency. In fact, his current Gallup approval rating of 42% extrapolates out to approximately a 40 seat loss in the House for the Democrats.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-6-Midterm.png))**

&gt; What does it mean for investors? Well, Republicans need to win only five seats to regain control of the House, which is quite likely at this point. The Senate is more of a coin toss, but history shows 4 seats have been added by the motivated party since World War II. With the Senate split 50/50 right now, this one is very close to call, but the Republicans could gain one seat and take full control of Congress. As the chart below shows, the very best scenario for stocks is a Democratic President and a Republican controlled Congress. Should the Democrats retain control of the Senate, that scenario of a Democratic President and split Congress is quite strong for stocks as well.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-7-Midterm.png))**

&gt; # Leave On Some Good News
&gt; Odds are investors will start to hear a lot more about the midterm elections over the coming weeks. You might hear that these sectors will do well if so and so wins, or that these sectors will do poorly if this happens. The truth is no one really knows. After President Trump won in 2016 it was widely assumed coal and steel would do great, the opposite happened. Then under President Biden green energy was to do great and dirty crude and coal would struggle, again, the opposite has happened. We aren’t saying you shouldn’t think like this, it just isn’t so clear cut.

&gt; What is clear cut is stocks historically have done quite well the year after the midterms. As you can see in our last chart, the S&amp;P 500 gained a year after the election every single time since World War II, with a very solid 14.1% average gain over that year. Why is this? Likely markets hate uncertainty and there is a lot of that leading up to a midterm election. But once the election is over the uncertainty is likely lifted.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-8-Midterm.png))**

&gt; So there you have it. Midterm elections are very important for a lot of reasons, but the best part for investors is once the election is over, stocks tend to get a nice tailwind. On the Carson Investment Research team we think this could happen once again and is one reason why we remain overweight stocks here.

&gt; # Four Charts On The Worst Month Of The Year

&gt; “October: This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February.” Mark Twain

&gt; Although October is known for some spectacular crashes, it is September that historically has been the worst month of the year for stocks, suggesting Mr. Twain should maybe change his famous stock market quote. In fact, as our first of four charts show, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.5% on average in September, making it the worst month of the year. It’s also been the worst month over the past 10 and 20 years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-1-090722.png))**

&gt; Why is it so weak you ask? The two ideas that make the most sense to me is first, the big boys are back from the Hamptons and begin to sell to square up their books. Secondly, many large hedge funds and institutions end their fiscal years in October and you tend to see some selling ahead of year-end. Of course, I’d like to ask why October isn’t weak if this is the case, but I digress. Whatever the exact reason, we just think it is important for investors to be aware of this potentially tricky month.

&gt; The next chart is something that most investors might not know. Most of the weakness historically takes place later in the month, while the first half is fairly strong.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-2-090722.png))**

&gt; Our next chart (or technically a table, but you know what I mean) is always a popular one, as it shows how each day of the year historically has done. This once again shows later in September is one of the worst times of the year. I’d like to note that my birthday is October 28, which until only recently had been the best day of the year. I’m not sure that’s a coincidence and I look forward to it taking back the number one spot soon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-3-090722.png))**

&gt; Finally, this last chart shows that if stocks are weak heading into September, things can get even worse. As you can see, the average September drops 0.5% on average, but sports a slight gain if it starts the month above the longer-term 200-day moving average. The catch is things get worse when it starts beneath the 200-day moving average or down more than 15% year-to-date. Given 2022 started September down 17% year-to-date and beneath the 200-day moving average, the potential for seasonal weakness is quite high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-4-090722.png))**

&gt; The good news is we do think the lows for the year are likely in, but it won’t be a smooth ride and we’d advise investors to be ready for some bumps over the coming weeks. Please continue to read our blog, as the Carson Investment Team breaks it all down for you.

&gt; # September Quarterly Options Expiration Dangerous, Week After Pitiful

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/53cbf2101439a76ee66194ee453e4cf5/2cf9b63054b755be-40/s500x750/a0e84576942c9514a8d54708039d6aa00ac97478.jpg))**

&gt; Since the S&amp;P index futures began trading on April 21, 1982, stock options, index options as well as index futures all expire at the same time four times each year—known as Triple Witching. Some call it Quadruple Witching or Quad Witch due to single-stock and ETF futures, their impact on the market has thus far been subdued.

&gt; Monday Before September Triple Witching is less bearish with DJIA and S&amp;P flat on average, but NASDAQ is down 14 of last 23 with and average loss of -0.25%. September’s option expiration week is up 57.5% of the time for S&amp;P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 52.5% of the time and 55.0% of the time respectively.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bc285c0f1763215ee591d196eeb4caeb/2cf9b63054b755be-72/s500x750/d45de71dcee7d32f722d27c6f861c643354c13c0.jpg))**

&gt; However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last nineteen years, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September’s option expiration week, up thirteen times, but NASDAQ is down the last four. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&amp;P 500 has been down nine of the last ten since.

&gt; **S&amp;P 500 Down 25 of 32 Week After September Quarterly Options Expiration, Average Loss 0.89%**

&gt; The week after September options expiration week, has a dreadful history of declines most notably since 1990. The week after September quarterly options expiration week has been a nearly constant source of pain with only a few meaningful exceptions over the past 32 years. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just four times: 1998, 2001, 2010 and 2016 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses.

&gt; Full stats are the sea-of-red in the tables here. Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA –0.98%, S&amp;P 500 –0.89%, NASDAQ –0.85%. End-of-Q3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer holdings and position for the fourth quarter.

&gt; # Historic Small Cap Volatility

&gt; It's no secret that growth stocks have underperformed value stocks over the last twelve months. The trailing-twelve-month performance spread (percentage points) between the small-cap growth and large-cap value indices, two opposite ends of the equity market, is currently at -20.5 percentage points. Although this is far above the recent low of -33.9 ppts, the current reading is in the bottom 6% of all days since the mid-1994 (when both the MSCI USA Small Cap Growth and MSCI USA Large Cap Value Index were active). Interestingly, this year's trailing twelve-month performance spread was the lowest since 2001 (unwind of the dot-com bubble). Funny enough, the spread had hit the highest level since early 2000 in 2021, as excessive performance from small-cap growth stocks has tended to reverse course after reaching extreme levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/TTM-Performance-Spread-ppts-090722.png))**

&gt; Small-cap growth stocks tend to trade at significantly higher valuation multiples than large-cap value stocks, which is part of the reason that small-cap growth equities have sold off at a higher rate than their counterparts. These stocks also have higher betas, so market moves have a disproportionate effect. These factors have caused the average daily percent change spread between the two indices to reach an extremely elevated level, the highest since 2000 - 2001. This measure of volatility is also yet to roll over, indicating no end to the volatility regime that has been in place.

t3_xa79df|1662759336|stocks|Let's talk about the semiconductor industry|"So, I am looking for investing opportunities in the semiconductor industry. I noticed that while the recent bottom for the S&amp;P 500 index was in mid-June, that for the semiconductor industry was in early July. What do you make of it? Do you think we will get a new bottom here in the near future?

I am eyeing 3 ETFs in this regard: $SMH, $SOXX, and $XSD. Which one would you suggest? Do you have a different suggestion?

As for single stocks, I think $NVDA has dumped a lot in comparison to $AMD. Should I start DCAing into $NVDA at $130s now? Be a devil's advocate and tell me why that's a bad idea.

Also, what's your opinion on $INTC? 

Thanks. Happy Friday!"|0.73|22|0|22
t3_xa6in0|1662757449|stocks|Why is it wrong in some people's eyes to just keep DCA?|"It seems like if you turn on CNBC or Fox Business the last few days that the sky is falling. The word ""recession"" is being used more than any other word if I am not mistaken. Even more than the word ""tapering"" or the words ""interest rate hike"". I have several friends of mine who have asked me since the June lows ""what do I do"" and my response is 100% of the time ""dollar cost average for as long as possible"". One person has $28k sitting in a checking account with no investments. I told them to withdraw $1k every month and pour it into VOO or SPY until they are down to $5k in checking. We can all disagree on if it would be better for them to just stick $23k of checking into VOO or SPY right now... 

My other friend is already heavily invested. He is like most people down about 18% YTD and tells me my advice of the past years ""dollar cost averaging"" is not cutting it for him. I feel bad he is down 18% YTD, but so is almost everyone else. 

Tell me why, if it is, that DCA is wrong. I think it is the best way to invest, and call me evil in bad times like this year, but it just is the best possible route. Both of my friends made me feel small today because they are certain we are going to have a 20% dip thanks to some of the talking heads out there saying things like the soon to come rate hike will lower stocks. 

Tell me - is this time around different? Should we have all sold in winter when we began to see slippage in the S&amp;P 500? 

My current portfolio: 

68% VOO ($21,000) 

8% TSLA ($2,470) 

7% TQQQ ($2,100) 

The remaining 17% is in cash ($5,250) right now. Should I myself sell everything and wait for a dip? If I do this I will lose out on my dividends payments to come in many weeks for VOO... My one friend said it would be wise to not VOO long term but instead buy the last day I can every few months to get the dividend? Please give me advice."|0.73|58|0|58

What if my portfolio was one of the major ETFs in each of the 11 sectors. And I vary the amount in each sector whether I’m bullish/bearish with it.
I think Energy is bloated? I sell a little and move it into a sector I’m more confident in.
This idea came to me this week, idk if it’s crazy or I’m overlooking something but it sounded like a good idea to me. Could be more research than I want but I like the idea of a more macro focused management.
I’d also like to hear any ideas on how to manage a bit more than just weekly deposits into VOO or QQQ or something.

On Friday, though, Wall Street-backed off its harsh stance —just a bit: One bearish analyst is now a little less bearish.

UBS analyst Chris Snyder upgraded his rating of 3M (ticker: MMM) stock to Hold from Sell and raised his price target to $126 a share from $118. He believes the stock price is down enough where potential outcomes from litigation are accounted for. 

3M is facing hundreds of thousands of lawsuits related to its sale of faulty earplugs to the military. The gear has been tied to hearing problems in veterans. In addition, the company is on the hook for cleaning up chemicals that leaked into the ground water where they were produced.

Wall Street has struggled to quantifying the liabilities. Analysts estimate the number in the tens of billions of dollars. Comparatively speaking, 3M’s market capitalization sits at about $68 billion. The liabilities are in large part why the stock for about 11 times estimated next year’s earnings, down from about 16 times three years ago. The Buy-rating ratio isn’t impacted by the upgrade. Of 21 analysts covering the company, one rates shares Buy—a little less than 5%. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&amp;P 5000 is 58%.

Snyder’s move, however, did change the Sell-rating ratio. Now, six of 21 analysts rate shares Sell—almost 30%. The average Sell-rating ratio for S&amp;P stocks is less than 10%. Also on Friday, Deutsche Bank analyst Nicole Deblase lowered her price target to $127 from $155. She rates shares Hold.

The average analyst price target now sits at about $138 a share. In trading, upgrade was outweighing the target cut. 3M shares were up 0.8%, at $120.18. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.8% as well, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6%. The stock is down about 33% this year.

Simply if the price of a company falls - then it's dividend yield rises. If the company can continue to pay it's dividends **(based on fundamental analysis)**  at an increasing rate, the price will adjust to it's median. Dividend  yield TTM is a ratio of share price to total payouts made over the last  12 months.

And this strategy  really surprised me - today my portfolio has 68% profit with 27% IRR and  2.8% yield on cost (1.7% dividend yield based on recent prices). And it  beats S&amp;P500 return by 20% for 2 years!

To be honest, AAPL makes 50% of its profits. I love this company and the  way they do business. I recorded a dividend yield of 1.4% for myself.

UNH and FUN could be a better choice, as history shows.

The next buy I think will be INTC, because only that bastard has negative returns in my portfolio and 10 year max div yield.

What do you think? Could this strategy be consistent, or it's just luck and good timing?

#[Stock futures rise as Wall Street looks to snap a 3-week losing streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose Friday following a choppy trading session as traders considered Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s latest comments on inflation.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose by 235 points, or 0.74%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.81% and 1.05%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Shares of DocuSign surged more than 17% in extended trading after the electronic agreements company reported an earnings beat. The company also issued a third-quarter revenue forecast that was above expectations.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 193 points, or 0.61%, during the regular session on Thursday — closing higher after alternating between gains and losses throughout the day. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.66%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.60%.
*****
&gt; Those gains put all three major averages on pace to snap a three-week losing streak. Through Thursday, the Dow is up 1.45%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.09%, and the Nasdaq Composite is 1.99% higher.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been volatile recently as expectations of a 0.75 percentage point rate hike this month grew on Wall Street, after the Fed chair said again that he is “strongly committed” to bringing down inflation.
*****
&gt; “I think that people are grossly underestimating what the Fed is going to have to do to fight inflation,” Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein said Thursday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “It’s incredibly ironic that investors are even considering a Fed pivot when the real fed funds rate remains about as most negative as it has historically been. So the Fed isn’t even really heartily fighting inflation yet. We don’t have a positive real fed funds rate. It’s hard to argue that we should turn wildly bullish anytime soon,” he added.

t3_x9tedw|1662724170|stocks|Question on VIX|"While I am not new at trading, I have a question for the swarm intelligence of reddit (the word intelligence used very hesitantly here):

The VIX routinely swings between 20 and 30 usd. I am almost inclined to think, that whenever the VIX hits 20 or below, it is an almost assured thing, to say that at some point in the next few months, volatility will pick up again and rise to around 30 (as it has historically).

Looking at the full-length historic chart, it has peaked above 30 at least 40 times since 2004, with the peaks becoming more frequent as time passes.

Looking at the macro-situation, I highly doubt volatility will decline anytime soon, no matter what fed / ECB policies are implemented, or what political factors change.

As such, I see the probability of the VIX swinging in this same range (if not higher) as time goes on as rather high, if not close to 100%.

So the investment idea would be to just buy whenever it drops below 20, and sell whenever it rises above 30.

Am I missing something here? Misinterpreting? Is this just too obvious to work?"|0.6|2|0|2

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I love nursing however nobody can pretend that the hours are great, and I've been injured by patients and the shifts enough to know I don't want to be doing this when I'm 60 like some nurses do.

I'm currently looking up and researching about investing but I'm confused about how tax works. I'm a UK citizen and I assume it will all be taxed if I sell anything and make a profit. Right now given I'm a full-time student I don't pay any tax as I don't earn enough. When I worked and did have to pay tax it was all done automatically. I've never had to actually deal with tax myself, so I'm oblivious if I need to do something. Does it change if I buy stocks in another country?

I would appreciate any help understanding this because the last thing I want to do is be in trouble with the tax man. I much prefer it when they need to pay ME money!

Thanks in advance!"|0.7|4|0|4

t3_x9fkxl|1662680563|stocks|Identifying future multibagger stock|"When looking for the next 5-10x over a period of \~5 years what's something they've got to have?

Looking at some very good multibagger stocks over the last few years like Plug Power and Enphase Energy, something they usually got in common are: 

* Low institutional ownership
* Low market cap
* Low share price

How important are these 3 fundamentals for a stock, in order for it to be a multibagger over the course of the upcoming years? Say stocks that are already valued at around $1bn, with institutional ownership around 70%, and a share price around $20. Meaning these stocks don't hit any of the bullet points (maybe the low market cap). My takeaway are stocks like these will  have a very hard time becoming a multibagger for the next years.

Assume you have a solid company, good management, great product. However institutions already own over 70% of the stock, how would such a company be a multibagger candidate? Is it even possible?"|0.57|2|0|2

t3_x9dvjy|1662676232|stocks|QT 2018 vs QT 2022|"First post here so please go easy on me. I wanted to start a discussion comparing the two Fed tightening cycles listed in the post title. 

Equity markets sold off in late 2018 while the first attempt of QT was in full effect from 2016 until about September 2019 along side a hiking cycle that looks to have ended June 2019 and then rate cuts commenced. The markets rallied from a bottom of December 2018 until Feb 2020. 

It is now 2022 and we are in the middle of a Fed hiking cycle soon approaching a restrictive Fed funds rate and the highest amount of monthly QT just started from the Fed balance sheet all to fight high inflation.

What were the main catalysts that fueled the sell off in 2018? Was it more related with the tariffs or was it tighter fiscal monetary policy weighing in on the markets? What exactly made the Fed pause QT and what made them cut rates?

Between rate increases and balance sheet runoffs, is one or the other more effective to combat the current levels of inflation?

Or is this just an apples to oranges comparison of tightening cycles to fight historic levels of inflation vs the Fed’s 1st attempt to unload assets from the balance sheet? I apologize if these questions have previously been posted. Thank you for your time."|0.88|44|0|44

Here are some stats to start: 3.3x sales of 944M last quarter, down 85% from ATH, growth rate of 41% with 31-32% guidance next earnings. 

This company stock price has taken a hit since November 2021 and has not seen any sort of recovery since. It is a clear down slope while making new 52w lows just last week. It is beaten up to the max and buying this now at this level makes it contrarian bet for turnaround. Yes this company loses whole bunch of money, last quarter was 300M loss. Also it has some bad news being hacked linked to OKTA and so on.

I'm trying to work out the search terms/indicator names that'll allow me to see a list of pairs that fluctuate regularly. 

I see there are things like Rate of Change, Momentum Oscillation, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, Coefficient of Variation but can't work out if there is a name/indicator for 'price goes up and down frequently.' I'm not too bothered about how much it 'goes up and down,' more that it does that frequently.

I thought the most obvious would be volatility but as far as I was aware, that includes the 'magnitude' of price movements, i.e. the deviation of percentage price change, as opposed to just how 'often' it goes up and down. (Unless anyone can think of a way to utilize volatility for my objectives?)

The opposite holds true; tech goes down faster and further than the broader market in bad times. The second absolute is that we are in bad times - Jerome Powell is trying to deliberately bring the market down. We can debate on if he should, but there is no debate on if he is trying to do this. 

The list of absolutes could continue - but due to us beginning the on average worst month for the stock market - I am betting against Apple and am buying up AAPD. I hold 21 shares of AAPD and will be selling when Apple goes to $141 later this month. We will retest the June lows, and there is a good chance AAPL with slide to $130 again, more money for those of us who invest in AAPD.

$IHIT is an Invesco fund that aims to generate income (I guess via dividends) during the time of its existence, and then return original NAV at termination (Dec 2023)

I have three questions about this one

1. Do they indeed return income via dividend, or is there another mechanism? I see they are returning about a 5% annual dividend
2. The prospectus says the goal is to return original NAV at termination. Original NAV was $9.83 and it's currently trading at $8.55. Is the return to NAV guaranteed and it would generate about 13% from now to December '23 ???
3. This is the weird one, $IHIT has currently an INSANE 1,000% borrow fee. I cannot understand how on earth it would get so much demand to get shorted, it doesn't seem to be a crazy ETF or anything. More strangely, there is a similar fund with termination in 2024 ($IHTA) which behaves more sanely with a 4% borrow fee

Something does not compute here, or otherwise I'm getting a few of these shares, let them get borrowed out (utilization also seems high) and cash on the borrow fee. Assuming my broker gives me a 50% cut of the borrow fee this would yield about 1.3% DAILY on borrow fee alone ?!?!"|0.67|3|0|3

*****

# [Stock futures are flat, weighed down by fears the Fed will keep raising rates aggressively](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Wednesday as investors worry that the Federal Reserve will hand out another large rate hike in September in a bid to tame high inflation.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 86 points, giving up earlier gains. S&amp;P 500 futures also retreated, edging lower by 0.30%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.27%. If the slide continues into the trading day, it could be the eighth negative session in a row for the Nasdaq Composite.
*****
&gt; Stock futures dipped into negative territory after a Wall Street Journal article suggested that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s commitment to reduce inflation could mean that the central bank hikes rates by 0.75 percentage point in September, which would be the third consecutive increase of that size. Markets have been hoping that the Fed would start to hand out smaller increases starting in September, but are now pricing in an 86% chance of a 0.75 percentage point hike.
*****
&gt; Stocks added to their three-week slide Tuesday. The Dow fell about 173 points, or 0.5%, and the S&amp;P 500 slid 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% to notch its first seven-day losing streak since 2016.
*****
&gt; The moves came amid a surge in bond yields that saw the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield jump to its highest level since June. The rate on the 30-year Treasury closed at its highest level since 2014. Bond yields move inversely to prices. Rates dipped slightly Wednesday, with the 10-year trading at 3.321%. The 2-year and 30-year yields traded at 3.47% and 3.472%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Investors are split on how to approach the market entering the first post-Labor Day week in September, a notoriously cruel month for stocks. All eyes are on the 3,900 level on the S&amp;P 500. Some see the index falling to even lower lows, while others are optimistic about a year-end rally.
*****
&gt; “With equities back to June lows and the rates path reset higher, more inflation easing along with decisive EU government intervention to tackle the energy crisis could prompt another bear squeeze,” Emmanuel Cau of Barclays wrote in a Wednesday note. “Big picture, we think stocks remain in a tough spot given a poor growth-policy trade-off.”
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will give its summary on current economic conditions, also known as the Beige Book. Elsewhere, Fed presidents Loretta Mester of Cleveland and Tom Barkin of Richmond, as well as Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard are scheduled to speak at various events.

This is pretty interesting. So Pfizer's got this now, along with a soon to be approved vaccine for RSV and what looks like most of the market for the annual COVID-19 vaccine. The also acquired a therapeutics company, ReViral,  for the treatment of RSV, putting them in position to have all the solutions for RSV as they have for COVID.

Assuming they settle the dispute with Moderna over IP claims within the next X years, they could emerge as the leader in vaccines. I know many have worried about its ability to continue generating the insane amount of money it has raked in from COVID vaccines, and it looks like those concerns are being answered. 

I suspect given its huge cash position ($33B end of Q2), it will continue shopping for cool new therapies to add to its pipeline. Other than AstraZeneca, I don't see a pipeline this big.   They just acquired a small cap company with a treatment for sickle cell disorder and I suspect others will follow.

My plan was wait until they announce a big acquisition and buy the stock on the dip, but it's getting harder to wait and they seem driven to acquire multiple small caps instead of doing something large. 

Given the recent news of the lawsuit by Moderna and the September sentiment, the stock is looking attractive for a long term bet if you assume they will reach a deal with Moderna or drag it out in court for years."|0.57|1|0|1

I know I’m not the first person to say this, or even ask this question, but I find it interesting; but why do people treat the tech industry like it’s a gold rush? This new and shiny disrupter in the world of finance? 

Because, now don’t quote me because I’m not too learned in finance history, but isn’t the tech industry just like the auto industry 100 years ago? This new innovating idea that is seen as the big transformer to society? 

I’ve heard it said, but I couldn’t tell you who said it, but I think they said, “the tech industry will end up plateauing and become like the auto industry is today”. Now I’m no expert on finance or stock trading, but I think it has some good meaning there. Because when I look at the tech industry, I see it as this new trend that will probably end up shifting into obscurity once the next big trend hits, kinda like the auto industry did, it’ll still be there, but it’s so common place in society that it’s not really seen as the bringer of new innovation. 

I know quite a few people who work in the tech industry, and a few regular joes who have quite a bit of money in APPL and AMZN, and when I ask then if they think the tech industry will ever slow down or plateau they just laugh and say “it’s the future, it’ll always keep innovating and bringing new ideas”. Okay well, you could argue Ford did that, and look where they are now. 

Just wanted to get some of your opinions on it, because from my point of view, it seems a lot of people see the tech industry as this Big Daddy, and it gets people scared when the price of AMZN or APPL stock goes down.

Edit: I think what I’m trying to ask, and a few people have touched on this topic in the comments, is, in a 100 years, are we still going to have big tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Meta around?"|0.55|3|0|3
t3_x7y5lg|1662533722|stocks|‘Extreme buyer hesitation’ pushes home sellers to rent instead of sell, and builders see rentals as a hedge against a cooling housing market|"Faced with weak demand from home buyers, home builders and sellers are increasing their focus on the rental market. And that’s likely good news for renters. Home sellers are facing a tough market. The 30-year interest rate is sliding past 6%, according to Mortgage News Daily on Tuesday, compounded by recession fears, are holding buyers back. Sellers are, as a result, giving into more concessions. One builder is even offering a “free finished basement.” 

Put off by the softer market, some sellers in the south and the west are instead putting their homes on the rental market. Rick Palacios Jr., research director at John Burns Real Estate Consulting, tweeted. Palacios Jr. said that he’s seeing a surge in sellers shifting from sales to rentals in California due to a rapidly cooling housing market in California, compared to the rest of the country.  “Home prices have been falling for several months now in major California markets, and sellers realize that, so they may be inclined to switch,” he told MarketWatch. Some of these homeowners were hoping to flip their house, but the cooling market is holding them back, he noted. “We know that investor transactions as a percentage of all home sales in places like Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, Sacramento, San Jose, and San Francisco, are all around 20% to 30%,” Palacios Jr. said.

The same trend is playing out among home builders. “There are a lot of builders that believe that the for-rent market can offer a hedge to a slowing housing market,” Ali Wolf, chief economist at Zonda, told MarketWatch. 

“There are builders that weren’t that active in the for-rent space a couple of years ago that are now working to build single-family homes for rent,” she added, “because they say we can offer the home, the location, the school district in some cases, all to a consumer without them having to worry about the down payment.” Wolf said she’s seeing the pivot happen where land prices are slightly cheaper, and where demand is still strong, like in Phoenix, Ariz., and parts of the south and the midwest.

The main reason being it's a strong growth stock, nice brand name, strong buy backs, and it's trading very cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

or is it?

&amp;#x200B;

Sure people always bring up it's trading at 20 PE, which in comparison to other big tech with apple and microsoft trading at 25-26 PE and Amazon/Tesla trading at 100, comparatively it is less overvalued.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I don't see people mention often is that google benefited heavily during covid with all the stimulus being thrown out, so the consumer was flushed with cash and it lead to companies increasing their advertising budgets leading to a digital ad boom. However, that seems to be normalizing if not on the decline. Google's revenue growth itself went from high 50% yoy last year to about 10% yoy last quarter (although this is a bit skewed because of easy comps during covid adpocalypse, and now harder comps from the post covid ad boom).

&amp;#x200B;

If google's eps suffers a reversion to the mean from tighter ad budgets, tougher competition, increased costs from increasing their workforce the by like 40% since 2019 then their PE could easily jump from 20 to 30 to 40. 

The price in PE is just one component, people often forget the E part which is earnings and it's likely earnings revisions to the downside will come. I feel this is somewhat reflected in the stock price already with google being noticeably weaker than other big tech the past couple of months."|0.65|10|0|10

Some have claimed they were put in place to help new traders but in reality they only hurt us by limiting when we can sell a stock. I've spoken to someone from FINRA and they said the rules were put in place to help the clearinghouses because they have to cover the margin credit and that multiple day trades makes that harder for them. But the big traders use far more margin than we do so that makes no sense. He also admitted that there doesn't seem to be any documentation or reasoning for the $25K limit - it's just arbitrary. 

He said the best thing we can do to get rid of these rules is to keep complaining about them to FINRA, the SEC (they oversee FINRA), and our congressional representatives (since Congress oversees the SEC). You can contact the FINRA ombudsman ([https://finra.ethicspointvp.com/custom/FINRA\_HelpLine/form\_data.asp](https://finra.ethicspointvp.com/custom/FINRA_HelpLine/form_data.asp)) and they report all the complaints about the rule each quarter to the powers that be. The more complaints they get, the more likely the rules can be repealed or at least changed. You can also contact the SEC ombudsman ([https://omms.sec.gov/](https://omms.sec.gov/)). They'll tell you the rules are from FINRA but the SEC oversees them so they need to hear this as well.

Also, more people need to contact their Congressional representatives to get these discriminatory rules repealed. These are the people that FINRA told me have the best chance to change things. It's not easy to get our representatives to listen to things like this but the more people who try, the better chance we will have.

On that note, I started an online petition. I'm hoping to get enough signatures to use it to convince my representatives that this is an issue that lots of people care about. I've seen other petitions started but they've since been closed so I started a new one.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x6lyop/meta_has_been_fined_402_million_by_the_irish_data/)

A fat fine — of $402 million — is headed Instagram’s way after European Union privacy regulators came to a decision on a long running complaint related to how the social media platform handles children’s data. The penalty is for a breach of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Meta was contacted for comment on the penalty.

We understand the final GDPR decision on the Instagram enquiry was sent to Meta, Instagram’s parent, Friday — ahead of formal publication on the websites of the company’s lead data supervisor in the EU, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC); and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), a steering body which helped coordinate a decision review process involving other interested EU data protection authorities — however the size of the penalty for Meta appears to have leaked early, via a report in Politico, which contains the fine figure (which shakes out to around $403M at current currency exchange prices) but no further details of the decision.

Ireland’s DPC confirmed the level of fine to us. Deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told TechCrunch: “We adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of €405 million. Full details of the decision will publish next week.”

The Instagram penalty is the largest GDPR penalty the social media giant has been hit with to-date (though not the largest ever GDPR fine; that one landed on Amazon) — following a $267M penalty levied upon the Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp last September for violations of the GDPR’s transparency principle.

The Instagram complaint focused on the platform’s processing of children’s data for business accounts and on a user registration system it operated which the DPC found could lead to the accounts of child users being set to “public” by default, unless the user changed the account settings to set it to “private”.

The GDPR contains strong measures requiring privacy by design and default generally — as well provisions aimed at enhancing the protection of children’s information specifically, as well as ensuring that services targeting kids are living up to transparency and accountability principles (such as by providing suitably clear communications that children can understand).

The reasoning underpinning the fine for Instagram is expected to be released in the coming days, when the final decision gets published next week (assuming it doesn’t leak early).

While today’s headlines are going to make painful reading for Meta, TikTok is another social media firm likely to be watching developments closely since it’s under investigation by the DPC over its own handling of children’s data. But that enquiry was only opened by the DPC a year ago so it’s likely to have some time to run before a decision is reached.

The Instagram decision took extra time as other DPAs raised objections to Ireland’s draft decision — triggering a mechanism in the regulation designed to settle disputes which can add many more months to the timeframe.

Ireland’s WhatsApp decision also went through a review process after objections were raised to its draft — and in that case the size of the penalty was substantially raised as a result. But it remains to be seen whether the same has happened here, with Instagram.

t3_x7ej9g|1662480714|stocks|Interesting stock story (Permian Resources)|"CDEV (Centennial) just had a very complementary merger with another company Colgate, and changed its ticket to NASDAQ:PR. The merged company will then trade on NYSE starting Sep. 12. This will open them to a flood of additional potential capital. You can trade the stock today on NASDAQ as PR. 

Fundamentally, (I have accounting degree) CDEV looks to me as if it has reached a critical upward inflection point toward high earnings and cash flows, combined with pulling on a massive combined asset base in the Permian basin across Texas and New Mexico. The merger brings a lot of know-how across additional vertical activities for petroleum and geological engineering. 

With all of this surveying, assessment, analytical, and extraction activities across such a wide asset base, the combined company sits in an interesting position to also potentially lease some of its extraction sites to others for other minerals, in times when oil prices makes a particular site uneconomical. 

They have stated no such plans, but their cash flow generation and valuable land assets make this stock worth significantly more than it is currently priced, in my opinion. 

With exploding demand for a wide variety of metals, minerals, and specialty materials, this company could truly benefit from its huge asset base, in terms of mineral resources, even if it chooses not to pursue them.

The analyst reiterated a Buy rating and $333.33 price target on TSLA after meeting with the company’s VP of Investor Relations, Martin Viecha.

Tesla believes that consumers will increasingly move toward EVs, even as it is too soon to quantify the effects of the newly signed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The analyst believes that consumers will be attracted to electric vehicles in the same way they were attracted towards other technology inflections (e.g. CRT to LCD TVs, and feature phones to smartphones). However, the EV industry could be supply-constrained over the intermediate term as new battery/component supply and assembly take time to ramp up.

Software and services, especially FSD, remain a key focus for the company as they continue to develop software and services to monetize the growing installed base of connected vehicles. Tesla believes FSD is one of the most important efforts in this category, and the company is targeting a wide release of its beta software in North America this year.

The analyst wrote in his note that he believes that ""Tesla, given its leadership position in EVs (including its vertical integration and tight coupling of hardware and software, as well as its ecosystem of charging stations and brand), and its focus on clean transportation more broadly (given its solar and storage businesses) is well positioned to capitalize on the long-term shift to EVs. We expect Tesla to expand margins in the intermediate term as it ramps the important Model Y product as well as new factories in Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas, and in the long-term as it increases its mix of software revenue.""

After holding steady on iPhone prices a year ago, some analysts expect that Apple AAPL, -0.10% will increase the price of its iPhone 14 Pro models this year amid camera, chip, and design enhancements—as well as lingering pressure from supply costs and the strong U.S. dollar. Amid the highest inflation rates in decades, there have been concerns about consumers growing more cost-conscious — especially lower-wage earners — but Apple is expected to keep its standard iPhone models at the same starting price while increasing the base $999 and $1,199 prices on its iPhone Pro and Pro Max.

“While the base iPhone will stay at the same price we believe a $100 price increase on the iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max is likely in store given component price increases as well as added functionality on this new release,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a recent note to clients. The company is expected to debut the new iPhone family at a Wednesday event that will kick off at 1 p.m. Eastern time. Apple’s smartphones are its biggest business by far, bringing in more than $162 billion through three quarters of the company’s fiscal year, more than 57% of Apple’s revenue total.

But The planned iPhone 14 debut comes amid uncertainty about how smartphone demand will hold up in the macroeconomic climate. IDC recently projected a 6.5% decline in global smartphone shipments this year, after shipments underperformed their estimates while declining for four quarters in a row. iPhone demand seems to have held up better than the overall market, however, and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said on the company’s last earnings call that he hadn’t noticed “obvious evidence of macroeconomic impact” on the iPhone.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Generation Investment Management, which the former vice president co-founded and chairs, dramatically increased investments in software giant Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) and e-commerce provider Shopify (SHOP), initiated an investment in card giant Mastercard (MA), and exited a position in rival Visa (V). The stock trades, among others, were disclosed in a form Generation filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the second quarter.

Generation, a London-based firm focused on sustainable and environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, declined to comment. It had more than $36 billion of assets under management as of March 31. The firm bought 3.7 million Microsoft shares to end the second quarter with 4.2 million shares. Microsoft stock slipped 24% in the first half of the year, compared with a 21% drop in the S&amp;P 500 index. So far in the third quarter, shares are unchanged compared with a 3.7% rise in the index. Microsoft has been cutting back on employee expenses by curbing business travel and company gatherings. Consumers have been spending less on videogames in recent months, which may be an issue for the company, which is in the process of acquiring game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI). Microsoft’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, reported in July, showed its slowest earnings growth in two years.

Shopify’s second-quarter report, from July, also disappointed, and revenue growth was hurt by a stronger dollar. Right before the report, Shopify announced the layoff of 1,000 workers, about 10% of its global workforce, as online shopping faded when consumers went back to stores. Meanwhile, Shopfiy CEO Tobe Lutke has been buying shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which he serves as a director. Shopify stock plunged 77% in the first half of the year, and so far in the third quarter shares are down 3.6%. Generation bought 7.4 million Shopify shares in the second quarter to raise its investment to 7.5 million shares.

The firm bought two million Mastercard shares in the second quarter. It hadn’t owned any at the end of the first quarter. Mastercard stock slipped 12% in the first half of the year, and so far in the third quarter, shares are up 2.2%. Mastercard’s second-quarter earnings, reported near the end of July, were strong, as were earnings by rival Visa. Both companies are betting cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin will one day be used widely and routinely for typical purchases. There is also a bill circulating that could shake up the giant credit-card networks of Mastercard and Visa. Speaking of Visa, Generation sold all of its 3.2 million shares in the second quarter. Visa stock slipped 9% in the first half of the year, and so far in the third quarter, shares are flat.

The research, based on an analysis of the online ad budgets of over 100 different consumer app companies, found that Apple’s ad business has benefited from the company’s major iOS privacy update in 2021, which made it more difficult for companies like Facebook to track users across the Internet. Apple’s search ads let people advertise on the iPhone maker’s App Store. Advertiser adoption rate for the second quarter rose almost 4 percentage points from a year earlier to 94.8%, while Facebook adoption fell 3 percentage points to 82.8%, Appsumer said. Google’s rate declined 2 points to 94.8%.

Apple has “joined the duopoly of Facebook and Google at the top table of advertiser adoption,” according to Appsumer, which is owned by InMobi. Shumel Lais, general manager at Appsumer, attributed Apple’s improved standing to an increase in the number of app developers willing to pay big money to bolster downloads. At the same time, Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) update has limited the amount of data ad-based apps like Facebook can use to help brands with their online ad campaigns. “One of the things that’s quite interesting is the ATT measurement limitations that are kind of put on the wider network doesn’t exist in the same way for Apple,” Lais said. “So you could say Apple has slightly more visibility or an advantage across the other channels on iOS.”

Apple’s rise in online ads for developers mirrors Amazon’s position in e-commerce, as retailers spend more money to promote their products on the site they rely on for customers. In terms of overall app developer spend on online advertising, referred to as share of wallet, Google remains at the top, with 34%. Facebook is second at 28%, followed by Apple at 15%. Amazon wasn’t listed because it’s not a platform for developers. At the lower end of the market, TikTok overtook Snap, which has also been hammered by ATT. TikTok has 3% market share, and Snap is at 2%, Appsumer said.

Rough numbers here: you want to hit it big and think the stock will run. Say you buy 500 contracts @ $7 strike April, 2023. Costs roughly $13,250. You hit it, stock goes up to $30. Rough math, you could profit $1.1MM by buying and then selling those 50,000 shares. I understand to do this you would need the capital. If you don't, you can sell the contract. 

I'm know it's not black and white, but how likely/easy it is to sell that contract and clear close to the $1.1MM profit? I understand you would probably need the stock to hit $30 and stabilize for at least  a few days/weeks in order to sell the contract. Just trying to understand if it is stupid to place a bet like that if you don't have the capital. Or if there's a very high likelihood of selling the contract for close to $1MM in this situation. Obviously it's a different discussion on whether this is a stupid bet from the beginning so leaving that part out. Of course I could have everything in the above scenario wrong.

**Here are a few things before you click on the link:**

· It's a huge watchlist created in Google Sheets with lots of formulas. It takes time and RAMs to load. (I am personally using 11th Gen Intel i7-11800h with 16GB of RAM with 34” monitor for a better view. My browser takes few minutes to load the whole watchlist)

· You'll find there around 1600-1700 stocks from whole world sorted into 11 Stock Market Sectors.

· On the very top you'll find daily gainers (top 5) and decliners (top 5)

· On every company you'll find following information:

1. **Logo**
2. **Company's name**. A lot of companies have notes included (my personal notes; notes on which money manager bought/sold this stock, when and how much he paid for it; etc.). I am updating this information on a daily basis.
3. **Dividend yield** with notes on historical payments. Yield changes daily based on stock price change.
4. My **SUBJECTIVE PE** based on average few years income. I left ""-"" symbol where I have no idea what PE to designate for a specific company at the moment. This the most controversial part of the whole watchlist. Lots of you will think that some of my designated PE’s are too high while others - too low. But I want to emphasize this – this is MY subjective view. Of course it will differ from yours. 😊
5. **% of up** from yearly low
6. **% of down** from yearly high
7. **Stock price**
8. **Graph of historical price changes** (2y)
9. **Graph of historical price changes** (7y - to have a bigger perspective) (deleted for now)
10. **Market Capitalization** in billions USD (need to make some minor changes for companies that are not from USA)
11. **Daily price changes**

***But that’s not all.***

In addition to that, please go to the right side of the sheet where you’ll be able to find several tables. Those are:

1. Companies sorted by dividend yield. Top 199 companies picked from whole watchlist.
2. Companies sorted by my SUBJECTIVE PE from lowest to highest. Top 500
3. Companies sorted by my SUBJECTIVE PE from highest to lowest. Up to 50.
4. Daily price changes. DECLINERS. Top 50.

t3_x68n0y|1662357964|stocks|Desperately need help. Can some real experienced option trader solve specific questions about ITM calls on expiry?|" 

Hello, I am new to the option market. I really need some experienced trader to help me solve questions about call option.

1. If the call option is ITM or even DITM, is it still possible to sell to close on expiry? By expiry I really mean ""the last trading hour or minute."" Is there really any rational real person to buy a ITM or DITM calls at last minute? If it's too hard or almost unlikely, does that mean I have to exercise my call to take my profit?
2. The 1st one comes to the supplementary question: In trading options, do I trade with a real person/company or a market maker agency? I mean if I trade to a real person, I hardly believe any rational person would trade calls on expiry. BUT if it's a market agency which trade calls automatically when I want to sell it, it would be no problem even if I sell to close by last minute.
3. If I am very unlikely to trade ITM calls on last minute before expiration, and I don't have enough cash to exercise, what can I do? Say exercising calls needs 10k dollars, and I only have 1k dollars on hand. Can I use 1k to exercise some calls and sell them at once, then repeat this process multiple times to finally cash out all my profit? Will the system automatically process these steps for me to cash out since it knows I earn a profit?
4. The last and ultimate one: You don't have cash to exercise ITM calls. Say if you got some info and predict the price will rocket exactly on 10/7 Friday, do you buy 10/7 calls or 10/14 calls to maximize your profit if the only way to cash out is selling to close? (Or 10/6 Thursday? Cuz last trading day is before expiry day? anyway, What I mean is the last day that I can sell my calls, not exercise it.) Because 10/7 calls are much cheaper than 10/14 if your prediction is correct, the only thing you worry about is if it's likely to sell.

Some pro traders please solve my confusion. Thank you all. I really appreciate it."|0.65|5|0|5

t3_x5x8mx|1662324285|stocks|Meta isn't NFT/Crypto, It's VR and Virtual Reality|"I know the reddit opinion of Meta isn't great, but I also think nobody understands it. It's not Crypto and NFT's, it's a bet on Virtual Reality. If you think Virtual Reality is going away, you're just simply wrong.  Everyone is bullish about Apple making $1000+ headsets for the first time, but suddently bearish when Meta makes BETTER headsets for less than half the cost?

Apple making VR Headsets is bullish FOR META because Meta owns all of the gaming infrastructure for the entire platform. You will be using Meta's platform, just on an Apple headset. Sure, Apple can turn it around, or attempt to turn it around, but they've already got the largest following, all of the infrastructure, and a years headstart in the VR/AR space.  Apple has a mobile games store.

I have not seen a single person use a VR headset and not be blown away by the technology. You put on the headset, and it's ready to use. You can use the hand controllers but it also can literally track your hands and you can play VR games just using their machine vision and hand tracking.

They have a BETTER VR headset than Apple for half the price and all of the infrastructure, and other's are trying to take a piece of the pie. They might be able to, but I think it either benefits them in the long term, or they fail trying to dethrone the Google of VR.  They have over 90% of the market share here, and have been perfecting VR/AR since 2014 when oculus was purchased, who has been working on the tech since 2012.

There isn't any similarities to the Crypto metaverse stuff. There's no NFTs, paid avatars, or wahtever. You have an avatar that follows you through games that you play as, but its completely free to use and customize and even if you do purchase things, for example, in game, thats not new. Most games have skins to purchase. It's just like Xbox avatars, Mii's, and everything else, except in VR. It's a bit more personal because you're playing as that charecter in games like poker, certain RPGs, etc and you look down and see it's your avatar, and its more immersive, but it's not like I am spending $4000 on a monkey picture and theres some open market that hyper monetizes VR.  In fact, there's DOZENS of free games and trials and experiences you can play within it. I didnt buy a game for the first several weeks because there's so much free stuff, including watching YouTube videos from the inside of the video and some other wild stuff.

It's unpopular, but:

1. 90% of the people, especially here, critical of Meta's vision of VR have never put on a VR headset
2. He might be an alien, but Zuck is spot on with his vision of VR.
3. Facebook, without their VR labs, is still an incredibly strong underlying business seeing lots of growth and printing money. Once VR takes off, that's only going to supplement the growth.

t3_x5x77t|1662324185|stocks|Should stock exchanges be open for trading 24/7?|" 

I'd like to hear your guys' opinion on this.

Should stock exchanges still have hours and be closed on holidays?  
It made sense for them to have working hours and holiday's off when the majority of trading was done on the floor and, of course, those guys had to go home and eat at some point. However, nowadays, it's reported that over 85% of trades are done electronically. On top of that, many institutions have their trading plans automated and not even executed by humans. When it comes to retail investors, the case is that everybody is trading electronically or have their money in a fund that in turn trades electronically for them.

So in this current state of affairs, should trading still be restricted to only 6 hours a day and completely closed on weekends and holidays?

Seeing, also, how most people are at work during the market open, it would be easier for them to trade at later hours after they come home from work. Another argument can be that trading is global now, and if you live several time zones from New York, like in Hawaii for example, you'd have to wake up at 3am just to catch the opening bell. That hardly seems fair and it doesn't represent even ground for everybody involved.

So what do you guys think?  
I know that I might be completely wrong or that I am missing some important factors, but it seems to me that at this time and age and technological advancements we should be able to trade the way we trade cryptos, 24/7."|0.5|0|0|0
t3_x5x6vm|1662324160|stocks|What does everyone think of railroads here?|"I have been looking into adding a railroad or two to my portfolio. Been doing research into this industry these past few weeks and all of the class 1 railroads that operate in the U.S. and Canada look like suitable investments. These companies have small monopolies and they are not going to have to deal with new companies entering the industry. The dividends these companies offer are also good and these railroads have great margins. $UNP looks like a great investment to keep growing over time, while the share price is high this company seems to continue to grow as the demand for goods increases. $CP I don't like as much because they move a lot of coal and seem to be bigger linked to agriculture commodities. $CNI has the best margin in the industry and this along with Union Pacific are the two I am looking the most at. $CSX has a good entry price to pick up more shares but seems to not have as good of management as the other tickers I have mentioned. $NSC does not really have my attention, probably due to the higher price I would pick UP over them. Then there is also BNSF but that is owned by Berkshire and Buffet so it is not directly a railstock.

These quotes are used very redundantly and wont seem to go away

“Buy the dip” or “the bottom is in” and my favorite “inflation is slowing” 

The wall-street media machine is suffering from a complete and compulsive denial of reality. 

A crash is coming like it or not, and it will be painful. 

For the crash deniers. A market crash isn’t abnormal at all. It is part of the boom/bust cycle. Yes markets move in cycles.

Also the fed can’t u-turn it’s caught in a debt trap. Meaning the fed can no longer buy treasury’s because debt to GPD levels have become unsustainable. Also inflation is spiraling outta control. So the fed cant cause more inflation. It’s hands are tied.
 
Tech is still highly overvalued. P/E ratios are still out of sync with rational logic and reasoning. What makes these companies worth so much? Besides the hype. 

From a historical perspective. Most major booms come with a major bust. The dot com boom, seems very similar to this 2020 boom with enormous amount of retail interest in the stock market. 

Let’s not forget that there is a global slowdown in growth. China is going through their own economic woes. Europe is struggling with recession. Sri Lanka is collapsing as well as Pakistan. 

The law of thermodynamics states that loss in a system is inevitable. And we can’t expect a system to sustain itself forever without adding more energy. This notion lines up with Karl marks socio economic theory of capitalism. (Crisis theory) which states that the amount of initial capital you use to run a business is lost and to sustain the business more capital is needed to an unlimited amount. ( is it possible to grow forever?)

Academic theory aside,  the constant bad news from policymakers at the fed is enough to know trouble is brewing.

When you use this data, keep in mind the simple question of when you will need to tap into your investments for the goal you intended. Obviously, if you are young, by all means go all in, but as one approaches retirement, it becomes more prudent to tap the brakes, and investing in fixed income.

If someone understands interest rates as more than arbitrary numbers - and - instead as an actual market prices that coordinates the decisions of saving and investing - as the economist Hayek did - well then as long as The Fed is still manipulating interest rates to be artificially low - then said permabear’s investing thesis would still hold true. This is before getting into the inflation problem and QE. 

So, if the FED has been massively inflating the money supply for years and a permabear is constantly saying “this is creating a bubble , this will end badly” - is he truly a permabear?

If someone is shooting heroin and I say “you need to stop. You are going to OD and die.” And after 3 years of shooting up - they die - was I being overly pessimistic? I view -some- so-called permabears in the same way. 

Now - there are actual permabears who are loons - and think the US economy is going to zero - that’s obviously not true. 

But look at the correlation between money supply and stocks prices the past few years - it’s like .9 

There is a lot of fake money propping things up that is going to get removed from the system and all adjacent businesses will begin a deleveraging process.

Just to end this tangent, I have no doubt that dollar cost averaging and buy and hold works. The data is pretty clear on that. However, if you are able to massively increase returns by shifting strategies during times like these by understanding a little Econ - why would you not? 

As a final point, I’m young (24) and haven’t sold any of my investments. I have, however, been taking advantage of this downturn by using puts and inverse ETFs (non leveraged) to build wealth so I can buy as we get closer to the bottom. 

Anyways, just thought I’d give my 2 cents."|0.68|25|0|25

However, maybe not? I am perfectly comfortable investing 80-90% into VTI. However, statistically proven in this book is to devote 60/40 toward VTI and Bonds (BND). With up to 20% toward international funds (VXUS). Looking through past performance it seems that Bonds would almost be a waste of 40% taxable investment. Should I invest in bonds at all? I am 35 years old. 

In addition, John Bogle says it's not necessary to invest internationally at all, but with other investors suggesting it is necessary. Finally,  the author of the book settles on suggesting an investment of around 20% internationally. I think between 10-20% would be ok to start and adjust later as necessary? 

Additionally, with the market trending toward bearish I feel this is an adequate time to invest heavily toward stocks. Which is why I think investing upwards of 90% of my monthly contribution to begin makes the most sense as typically people place money in bonds to protect their investment during this kind of market and I feel it's not necessary to invest in at the moment since I am just starting out investing in these funds. When there is a rebound in the market I think my dollar cost average towards VTI will be beneficial and during that time of the market I can adjust again towards bonds.

t3_x5plae|1662305047|stocks|PVH stock analysis and valuation - An undervalued company?|"I am quite sure that the three letters PVH do not ring a bell by most, compared to the brands this company owns such as Calvin Klein &amp; Tommy Hilfiger.

After going through the financials myself, I thought this is an analysis worth sharing. Feel free to disagree with me, add additional insights, and provide feedback. **Let's get started!**

**What is PVH?**

In a nutshell, it is an apparel company that owns quite some brands. However, Calvin Klein &amp; Tommy Hilfiger are the key ones as they contribute over 90% of the total revenue. The main activities the company undertakes are in the area of designing their new products as well as marketing. The manufacturing is outsourced which could be seen as a risk if import tariffs between certain countries significantly change.

&amp;#x200B;

**The financials**

The company's revenue didn't significantly change in the recent past. It grew from $8,2b to $9,9b in 2019 prior to the pandemic, then it decreased to $7,1b and now is close to $9b. 

Since 2016, it grew by an average 2% year over year. This indicates a fairly mature company with limited growth ahead.

In the period between 2016 and 2022, the gross margin improved from 53% to 59%. This is amazing, however, the remaining operating expenses (SG&amp;A) grew from 45% of revenue to 49% of revenue.

This leads to a marginal improvement of the operating margin that has been fluctuating between 8 and 10% (2020 being an exception due to the pandemic). The company's currently generating an operating income of around $900m a year. Its market cap is **$3,65b.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Management's guidance**

Looking into the historical numbers, it is quite clear that we cannot expect a significant increase in revenue or operating margin. On April 13th, 2022, during investor day, the management provided some guidance for FY 2025, targeting:

\- Revenue of $12,5b

\- Operating margin of 15% 

Knowing that this company has profitability similar to 5 years ago, it is difficult to include the management's guidance into my valuation assumptions as the company hasn't proven that it can deliver (yet).

&amp;#x200B;

**The balance sheet**

There are 3 main points regarding the balance sheet:

1. They have great inventory management, with no significant excess in any given year.
2. The debt has been reduced by $900m in the last 5 years.
3. The shares outstanding have decreased from 77m to 67m.

&amp;#x200B;

So, we have the exact same company (in terms of profitability), with $900m less debt &amp; 13% fewer shares outstanding. Yet, the share price today is 57% lower than it was 5 years ago!

The company has new CEO since the beginning of 2021, so it is not yet clear whether the company's strategy will continue in paying down debt &amp; buybacks or if there's another plan in mind specifically focused on growth (revenue/margin)

&amp;#x200B;

**The key assumptions about the future &amp; valuation**

Personally, I do not want to include future potential and any wishful thinking. So in my DCF, I have the following:

\- **Revenue growth** of 0% for the next 12 months followed by 3.2% (same as the risk-free rate today)

\- **Operating margin** of 9%

\- **A discount rate** of almost 8.8% (WACC-based)

  
If they deliver better results, then great! Until then, I'll be conservative with my assumptions.

Based on these assumptions, the fair value of the company is 4,2b **($62.87/share)**

The current market cap is $3,65b ($54.58/share)

*Note: I have taken into account the cash, debt, and deferred taxes on their balance sheet as well as the outstanding equity options.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on the assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 33% in 10 years and the operating margin will be 9%.

I am aware that my assumptions could be significantly wrong. So, let's take a look at how the value of the company (per share) will change based on different assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue / Op. margin|8%|9%|12%|15%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0% ($9,1b)|$49.0|$60.7|$92.7|$124.8|
|33% ($12,0b)|$49.5|$62.9|$102.5|$142.2|
|50% ($13,5b)|$49.7|$64.1|$108.0|$152.0|
|93% ($17,4b)|$50.0|$67.2|$121.6|$196.1|

&amp;#x200B;

The table illustrates how important is for the company to decrease the SG&amp;A as % of revenue and improve the operating margin.

In the first row, the revenue of 0% is based on a scenario where the company remains as is today, with no future growth in revenue at all. If that's the case, it'll deliver $400-$500m free cash flow per year.

The second row is based on my assumption (regarding revenue growth)

The 3rd row is somewhere between my assumptions and management's guidance.

The 4th row is based on the management's guidance.

If the management delivers the 15% operating margin &amp; revenue growth, the fair value today is almost $200! That's over 3x today's price.

Can they deliver? It is possible, but there's a very low probability of that happening.

**The risks**

I personally see two main risks:

1. The risk of recession where the demand for their products significantly decrease
2. The introduction of new tariffs that have an impact on their profitability.

&amp;#x200B;

Gustavo Arnal, 52, joined Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY.O) in 2020. He previously worked as CFO for cosmetics brand Avon in London and had a 20-year stint with Procter &amp; Gamble (PG.N), according to his LinkedIn profile. On Friday at 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT), police responded to a 911 call and found a 52-year-old man dead near the building who appeared to suffer injuries from a fall. Police identified the man as Gustavo Arnal. The police statement did not provide further details on the circumstances leading to Arnal's death but added that the New York City Medical Examiner's Office will now determine the cause of the fatality.

On Aug. 16, Arnal, sold 55,013 shares in the company, Reuters' calculations showed based on SEC filings. The big-box chain - once considered a so-called ""category killer"" in home and bath goods - has seen its fortunes falter after an attempt to sell more of its own brand, or private-label goods. Last week, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond said it would close 150 stores, cut jobs and overhaul its merchandising strategy in an attempt to turn around its money-losing business.

*A U.K. fund manager says the big worry isn’t inflation, it’s the Fed reversing quantitative easing*

By James Mackintosh on Sept. 3, 2022 10:00 am ET

Think inflation is the biggest threat to your investments? Perhaps not: One fund manager that successfully navigated the past two major stock crashes is bracing for an awful end to the year because it fears the Federal Reserve’s quiet exit from bonds.

London-based Ruffer LLP is concerned that the accelerating runoff of the Fed’s Treasury holdings will suck liquidity out of the markets—just as rising rates and falling stock and bond prices increase the need for cash to smooth the drop.

“It puts a pincer on equities and bonds at the same time,” said Alex Lennard, investment director at Ruffer. It could be “the sort of event you tell the grandchildren about.”

Ruffer is far from the only investor growing queasy at the prospect of the Fed’s quantitative tightening, which is reversing the huge growth in the central bank’s balance sheet since quantitative easing began in 2008. 

But it is perhaps the most surprising. Ruffer, which runs money for institutions and private investors, spent much of the past decade prepping for inflation by accumulating a massive holding in the longest-dated inflation-linked bonds available, 50-year debt issued by the British government. Now it is holding 40% of its assets in cash and equivalents, an investment that cannot keep up with inflation.

Ruffer has a decent record when it comes to crises: Its funds barely dropped in the 2020 lockdown that took stocks down by a third, and made money as markets plunged in 2008-09. But it has underperformed in bull markets.

The Fed doubles the pace of its bond runoff this month, aiming to reduce its Treasury holdings by $60 billion and its mortgage-backed securities by $35 billion monthly. Those concerned about the impact include hedge fund giant Bridgewater, which thinks markets will fall into a “liquidity hole” as a result. 

Bank of America equity strategist Savita Subramanian says QT alone could lead to a 7% stock price drop as the boost from QE is reversed. Steven Major, global head of fixed-income research at HSBC, thinks the interaction of QT and the plumbing of the financial system is too complex for anyone to predict properly. “The truth of it is that no one really knows,” he says, including the Fed.

The last time QT was tried, under Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, now Treasury secretary, it went perfectly—until it suddenly didn’t. Ms. Yellen said the predictable pace of balance-sheet reduction starting in 2017 should be “like watching paint dry,” and for two years it was. Then in 2019 the overnight lending market—crucial to the financial system and reliant on plentiful reserves—seized up, forcing an emergency rescue to prevent a full-on credit crunch.

QT is a bit different this time, the main reason that Ruffer is so fearful. Before we get into it, a quick reminder on central bank reserves for those who haven’t delved into the monetary system for a while. The Fed creates reserves as a special form of dollars that can only be held by banks and some similar firms, that they use to settle debts to each other. (The rest of us mostly use bank-created electronic money, plus physical dollars.) Since QE began, reserves have ballooned as the Fed created reserves to buy bonds from banks.

Unlike in 2017, large quantities of reserves have been returned to the central bank via money-market funds. These funds, which savers use as a liquid alternative to savings accounts, are allowed to deposit money at the Fed overnight using reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs), and have already sucked $2.2 trillion of reserves out of the system, up from zero at the start of last year.

For now, the loss of reserves isn’t a problem. Banks had too many deposits and reserves anyway, and they still have $3.3 trillion of reserves, more than they had ever held until last year. But there are risks.

Ruffer’s concern is that the loss of reserves will impede the banks’ willingness to take risks. That doesn’t matter too much when markets are calm, but, to put it mildly, they aren’t. Ruffer expects widespread withdrawals from fund managers after the terrible year they’ve had, forcing sales of stocks and bonds. If banks are constrained and unwilling to deploy money, they won’t cushion price declines and markets could drop suddenly.

A wonkier concern is that the loss of reserves to money-market funds will drain the banks so much that their reserve levels approach the minimum the Fed thinks is needed to avoid a repeat of the 2019 breakdown. Deutsche Bank strategist Tim Wessel argued in a recent note that the Fed would probably stop QT when the banks have $2.5 trillion of reserves. 

If money-market funds keep grabbing deposits and parking them with the Fed’s reverse repo facility, that could be reached as soon as January, he says—forcing the Fed into an embarrassing early end to QT. As an alternative, it could cut the rate it offers money-market funds to try to shift money back to bank deposits instead.

Where this stops being wonky is that an early end to QT would mean higher rates would be needed for the Fed to tighten policy the same amount, something sure to hit stocks.

The problem with these risks is that they’re real, but it’s impossible to say if or when they will hit. I don’t have enough confidence that trouble is so imminent that investors need to go heavily into cash the way Ruffer has. There are enough other issues—especially the market’s failure to prepare for weaker earnings next year—to keep me bearish on stocks, but inflation makes cash an expensive place to hide. Still, QT is a risk to watch closely, because it’s only boring until it suddenly isn’t."|0.81|91|0|91
t3_x4zob6|1662225502|stocks|Stocks are down a lot of right now and will go back up when the economy is better. Does that mean we should just buy high-growth tech stocks|"**My quick thoughts on the subject:**

* Stocks are down due to recession headlines and higher interest rates
* Eventually stocks should go back up when the economy gets better
* Since high-growth tech stocks are the ones that are getting hit the hardest in this bear market, that means they'll also gain the most when the market recovers.
* I think I'll get higher returns if I get these high-growth tech stocks at a lower price, be patient for them to recover, and they'll give larger returns compared to other investments"|0.89|905|0|905

Sometimes I lose, but when I'm in the red I just buy more oil shares till it skyrockets again. I've made roughly $30,000 in the past few months and every week I gain, I usually will sell all shares, throw my gains into my bank account, then keep my limit of $7,000 back into my brokerage account, and buy as much oil stocks I can. Then rinse repeat every Friday if I make gains. For example, I made $1,200 last week when oil skyrocketed. Sold those shares, put the $1,200 in my bank. Put the $7,000 back into shares.

 So my question is, how hard does the IRS come after those gains, and what's the percentage they tax? Also, is it good to sell at loses sometimes so you can claim losses on your taxes and not pay so much?

Recently I went all in on a single stock and found myself holding the bag.  I'm on a cash account with my broker so I have to buy stock with settled cash or wait to sell until 2 business days later.  Here's how I have dealt with my situation.  I'm wondering if this is a strategy others have done and I could study to improve on. It seems to fit my work/life schedule.

Every day the price is still quite volatile, changing 10-15%.  I started viewing my stock as though I was a store owner and I sell this stock when it predictably rises 5-8% every morning in the first hour and buy it back when it comes down off it's peak an hour or two later.  It's almost like I have customers in my store in the early morning and later my supplier stops by and I restock.  I have been slowly increasing the number of shares I own which allows me to sell more two days later.

I'm not focusing on the price I paid for the original shares as long as I sell and buy each day at a profit and reinvest profits into more shares.

I broke even from my bag holding this week and closed out today with a profit when I evaluate all my moves on a spreadsheet but my broker account still says I have lost money on the stock.  I know I made money though because my account is worth more now than the amount of cash I deposited on August 5th when my balance was near zero.

Does this strategy have a name? Has anyone ever heard of anything similar I could read more about? I built a simulation program and played with percent to buy and percent to sell and percent above open price to sell at to maximize gains but if this is a strategy I'm sure another mathematician more focused on financial mathematics will have a detailed analysis of this I could read.

So far The pound has depreciated around 17% against the dollar and I want to protect my future investment in case of a reversal.

However, I cannot calculate how much I need to invest in the etf to mask the currency fluctuations from my investment.

t3_x4i65p|1662168682|stocks|Inflation is still as bad as it was in March.|"Source here: https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/ 

Inflation was at 8.5% in March. It's almost half a year later and it's still at 8.5%. It's moving in the right direction but we have to remember: When we look at annual inflation, adding a month on one end and chopping a month from the beginning still leaves eleven months in the middle. If the Fed can lower inflation at the same pace at which it skyrocketed we're in for a full year of pain starting *today*.

This is what it means when you think about investing for the ""long term"". If you invested $1000 in the S&amp;P at its peak in 2001, it would take 13 years to break even. If you invested the money halfway down, it would take 10 years to break even. And right now, valuations remain sky high.

So I'm not an oracle, but IDK how the fuck people think they can fight the fed for the next year. You gotta really beat the market just to do better than holding cash. Equities are going to tank because the Fed is determined to destroy them, no?

Here's the thing: Even if the strongest growth companies priced at ridiculous valuations keep pace, that doesn't mean the market cap has to grow with them. These companies can keep growing while the share price shrinks to smaller multiples. This is what happened in the 70s: the airline industry took off, but investors lost heaps of cash trying to ride the wave.

# **Major stock averages slide for third week, Nasdaq posts six-day losing streak - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/stock-futures-are-flat-ahead-of-key-august-jobs-report-due-friday.html)**
*****
&gt; U.S. equities fell on Friday to cap their third straight weekly decline, after a solid August jobs report failed to ease fears that the Federal Reserve would keep aggressively hiking interest rates to fight inflation.
*****
&gt; After rallying through the morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased a 370-point gain and finished the session lower by 337.98 points, or about 1.1%, at 31,318.44. The S&amp;P 500 fell roughly 1.1% to 3,924.26, its lowest close since July. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.3% to 11,630.86, recording its first six-day losing streak since 2019.
*****
&gt; All of the major averages were lower to end the week, making it their third negative week in a row after slumping in the final days of August. The Dow and S&amp;P lost roughly 3% and 3.3%, respectively, while the Nasdaq fell 4.2%.
*****
&gt; “There’s still a lot of nervousness around what we’ll see over the next few months,” said Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst at eToro. “Yes, inflation and the job market are coming back into balance, but at what cost? Markets are still figuring that out.”
*****
&gt; “To make matters worse, the S&amp;P 500 is trapped in the danger zone – below its three big moving averages,” she added. “Those moving averages served as floors up until a few weeks ago. Now, they seem to be ceilings that the index just can’t bust through. The mood has definitely changed. While we may not test the lows of this sell-off again, we also may not reach new highs any time soon.”
*****
&gt; Stocks had been weighed down throughout this week by hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that interest rate hikes aren’t going away anytime soon. That’s put traders on watch for a retest of the June lows, especially knowing September is historically a poor month for the market. Some have suggested that if the S&amp;P 500 fails to hold the 3,900 level, those summer lows could come back into play.
*****
&gt; Some investors were briefly comforted on Friday by the highly anticipated jobs report, which showed the economy added 315,000 jobs for the month, just under the Dow Jones estimate for 318,000. Stocks rallied in the first part of the day.
*****
&gt; The unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, two-tenths of a percentage point higher than expectations. The August report is particularly important because it’s one of the last major economic reports the Fed will weigh before it raises rates at its September meeting. This data point could help the central bank determine whether a 75-basis-point hike.
*****
&gt; The last major economic report of note is August CPI on Sept. 13 and is more likely to determine how aggressive the Fed needs to be in the near term.

&gt; # Weakness on Tuesday After Labor Day – DJIA and S&amp;P 500 Down Five Straight

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cc7cc8409c0c340cadf9a7b61cfc41ee/1e21b309f0b8c0aa-bc/s500x750/2bdde9987f231ac50cf4d87e13c9fde88f4e9cc4.jpg))**

&gt; In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.03% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last five years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market’s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 0.30%. S&amp;P 500 is weakest, up only 47.6% of the time with an average gain of 0.29%. NASDAQ has a better record up 52.4% of the time on Wednesday, but a smaller average gain of 0.26%.

&gt; # Bears Back Above 50%

&gt; In the wake of Jackson Hole and more hawkish than previously expected Fedspeak, the S&amp;P 500 is on pace for its worst week since June. As a result, recent improvements in investor optimism have been entirely given back. The AAII survey of individual investors saw only 21.9% of respondents report as bullish this week. That is the worst reading in two months as the back-to-back declines over the past two weeks total 11.4 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-1.png))**

&gt; That was matched with a considerable increase in bearish responses. For the first time since early July, over half of respondents reported a pessimistic outlook for equities. Bearish sentiment's eight percentage point week-over-week increase was the largest since mid-June and the third weekly increase in a row.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-2.png))**

&gt; The inverse moves of bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread to quickly move down to the worst level since the start of July. That follows a string of readings only a couple of weeks ago in which bears outnumbered bulls by only single digits.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-3.png))**

&gt; Given the reversal in the spread, the streak of negative readings presses on. Now at 22 weeks long, it ties the 1990 streak for the second longest on record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-5.png))**

&gt; The AAII survey was not alone in showcasing a much more pessimistic tone of investors. Both the NAAIM Exposure Index and the Investors Intelligence survey also pivoted to more bearish readings. Combining these three results, the average reading on sentiment has fallen back to more than one standard deviation below the historical norm. Although that is not as pessimistic of an aggregate sentiment reading as earlier this year, there have only been a handful of other times going back to the mid-2000s in which the investment community had as negative of an outlook towards the equity market.

&gt; # August Declines All Around the World

&gt; The end of August is here and US equities, as measured by the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY), have been on a wild ride. At the mid-month high, SPY was sitting on a 4.3% month-to-date gain, but that has more than entirely been erased as it is on pace to finish the month down closer to 3.5%. The country ETF of each other major global economy that we track in our Global Macro Dashboard is a similar story. Across these countries, on average, they had reached a 3.13% gain at their month-to-date highs, but today they are down an average of 3.5% MTD. Overall, developed markets have faired much worse than emerging market countries with average declines of 4.82% versus 1.24%, respectively. In fact, there are only two ETFs—Brazil (EWZ) and India (INDA)—that are currently positive for the month. Meanwhile, China (MCHI) is unchanged. On the other end of the spectrum, Sweden (EWD) has been the worst performer nearing an 11% decline with a number of other European nations following up with the next worst performance.

&gt; With stock markets around the world giving up the ghost in August, most have moved back below their 50-DMAs or even into oversold territory. There are no country ETFs more than one standard deviation above their moving averages although EWZ and INDA have only moved out of overbought territory in the past week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/083122-GMD-1.png))**

&gt; As we show in the table above, this year's declines have resulted in the average country ETF falling 24% below its 52-week high. Those declines bring the vast majority of these countries back below pre-COVID highs as well. At the moment, there are only four countries that remain above pre-COVID 52-week highs: Taiwan (EWT), India (INDA), the United States (SPY), and Canada (EWC). This exclusive group would need to fall substantially further to revert back to those prior highs, and as shown in the chart below, each one would also still have support at lows from earlier this year before pre-COVID highs become a technical level worth eying.

&gt; # High Correlation Between Stocks and Bonds

&gt; So far in 2022, stocks and bonds have both sold off, leading investors with a balanced portfolio to experience historically painful drawdowns. Rates have risen, and partially because of this fact, equities have had a tough year. The S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is down 16.0% on a YTD basis, while the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) has shed 11.3% of its value. Typically, rates fall alongside equities, as investors shift their capital allocations to safer assets. 2022 has been different, though, and has seen selling in both bonds and equities. This has resulted in a historic level of positive correlation between the ETFs SPY and AGG going back to 2004 when AGG first started trading.

&gt; Although the 200-day correlation between stocks (SPY) and bonds (AGG) has been higher once before (in late 2009), the current level remains particularly elevated. The current 200-day correlation sits at 0.87, which signifies a strong positive relationship. In the last 200 days, stocks have moved in the opposite direction of rates on most days, as the market is incredibly focused on the bond market as the Fed transitions from an accommodative to a restrictive stance in the face of higher inflation. Interestingly, the correlation coefficient does appear to be rolling over, moving lower in each of the last 15 trading sessions. Historically speaking, the correlation coefficient has tended to turn negative not long after rolling over, as illustrated by the chart below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/Stocks-and-Bonds-200-D-083022-2.png))**

&gt; The more we zoom in, the more the rollover becomes clear. The higher frequency measures, such as the 100 and 50-day correlation coefficients, have already moved substantially off of their recent highs, even though they are still elevated relative to history. The 100-day correlation coefficient is now at just 0.70, while the 50-day coefficient is even lower at 0.55, the lowest levels since mid-June and mid-May, respectively. This tells us that the 200-day correlation will likely pull back further, thus giving SPY a chance to gain even as rates rise, and visa-versa. As evidence of this, today SPY is down over 125 basis points even as AGG is up six bps, moving in opposite directions. To make a long story short, bonds and stocks may begin to diverge in terms of performance as the correlation between the two assets begins to roll over. Now you just have to figure out which direction they'll each go!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/Stocks-and-Bonds-50-D-083022-2.png))**

&gt; The rolling 100-day correlation between stocks and bonds has been over 0.5 (or 50%) for 129 trading days, which is the longest streak since the inception of AGG by a considerable margin. Although the coefficient is declining, the 100-day correlation would need to drop another 0.2 points for this streak to end.

&gt; # Continuing Claims Catching Up

&gt; Initial jobless claims had a strong showing this week as the previous reading was revised lower by 6K to 237K. From that revised level, claims fell another 5K down to 232K marking the lowest reading since the last week of June. That was also handily below expectations which were calling for an increase up to 248K. With another week over week decline, claims have now fallen for three weeks in a row; the longest streak of declines since February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted (NSA) basis, the current week of the year has historically marked the annual low. Assuming that is the case this year, 176.8K is in line with the readings from the comparable week of the year in 2018 and 2019. Although further declines are not out of the realm of possibility, assuming normal seasonal patterns, NSA claims will likely rise from here through the end of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims are lagged an additional week to initial claims.. While continuing claims remain low having avoided the same degree of upward drift that initial claims have experienced this year, this week's reading did move up to 1.438 million. That marks the most elevated level since the first week of April.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Claims-3.png))**

&gt; Recently we have been highlighting the ratio of initial claims to continuing claims as a way of showing the disconnect between the two seasonally adjusted readings. In other words, the lack of filter through of initial claims into continuing claims, which can be extrapolated as those filing for unemployment are quickly finding new roles. Although the ratio remains well above the historical norm and especially the range of readings observed since the early 1990s, it has begun to roll over in the past five weeks. As for just how big of a drop it has been, the decline ranks in the bottom 2% of all 5-week moves on record. While that is not to say the overall claims picture (initial claims not turning into continuing claims) has completely turned around, it is a sign that continuing claims have been playing a degree of catch-up.

t3_x4f2mg|1662159630|stocks|Trading advice, trailing stops|"So I'm not a trader, I don't even own individual stocks. 

I recently initiated a transfer of assets out of brokerage who required that I liquidate certain positions prior to transfer.  

This has presented a unique opportunity for me, to potentially use a trailing stop order to repurchase my positions at the new brokerage. The money is still in transit.

The opportunity: my positions were all sold around a week and half ago, at about 5-6% above current price. So that's great. I could just rebuy into the positions next week, hopefully the market is still down and I could lock in a little profit.  But it occurred to me that if the market is down, I could try to ride the market down with a reasonable trailing stop order.  My thought would be to set a stop at about 3.5% above the current price (still 1.5-2.5% below what they sold for), and see how far down we can go.  

Is this a waste of time, is this outright foolish for someone who doesn't usually trade? 

I'm confident in my ability to setup the orders as I've specified, but I'm curious to hear feedback on the strategy itself. If it's relevant, the positions are all popular ETFs, mostly passively managed. e.g. VTI, VEA, VWO, AVUV

Thanks!"|0.85|9|0|9

t3_x49bzc|1662144654|stocks|My thoughts on the upcoming weeks/months|"
Let me start out I’m not a professional trader when it comes to stocks, nor do I claim to be great at the market. However, I do have a highly coveted Poli Sci degree that I no longer use so let’s see if I can put it to use. Just because someone isn’t a wizard with the math, doesn’t mean they can’t spot macro economic trends. Tail or fade me how you will but I think reasoning is solid. 

Right now it seems like public sentiment is still fairly mixed on if things are going to get bad or smooth over. What I can tell you is if you’re on the fence side towards bearish. Reasoning: people are psychologically predispositioned to underestimate the likelihood of bad things happening. So what we’re seeing right now is that lower and some middle class families are getting hit fairly hard from inflation, as these are the groups most likely to have to take out loans for purchases/living paycheck to paycheck. They’ve been feeling the hurt and can tell you most everything is not ok; however, the majority of these folks do not own stock or at least not enough to make a difference. We don’t start seeing stock ownership go up until we get into higher areas of middle class families. If I’m right these folks have noticed some inconveniences but nothing life changing. Because of this I don’t think these upper tiers of average investors can quiet see how bad it is on the ground. Sure they read the news, but this group doesn’t seem to fully take notice until it effects them. A lot of these folks will also fall under a more right leaning political ideology, which usually means more distrust in government. So when JPow comes out and says we have to get inflation under control at all cost and this will be bad if we don’t, a lot of this group is blowing that off as propaganda. Because of this I think the markets are going to be delayed in how they react. So good luck to everyone trying to guess how delayed the are.

Also we are entering a major shift in global powers. China has yet to overtake the U.S., but they are getting closer. There is a reason you are starting to see the us more hostile to China from Taiwan to trade. If this continues global supply chains are going to be rendered useless as so many companies have not hedged production to factor in US Chinese relationships dissolving. This will also make inflation much stickier. As both nations look to be heading for sizeable recessions what could make US recovery harder is if China is able to rebound quicker. With China having central control of the economy this is very likely to happen. 

So where does that leave the US? Well if China is able to recover quicker than the US, it does leave the possibility that American companies might not be the most attractive to investors. I believe this is part of what some of the perma bears are talking about when they discuss greatly inflated equities. A lot of these stocks have been valued so high on predictions of future growth. However, if the US markets start becoming not the best place to put your money going forward, those companies who are priced for future growth are screwed, because of global markets and debt being much more expensive which they will be forced to take on more and more.

This seems like a scenario where Bulls are going to have to get dragged facedown in the pavement along the way until we get through this. Let me know what you think, always open to amending my thought process."|0.65|13|0|13

t3_x47ij8|1662140064|stocks|Another Head &amp; Shoulders Pattern on SPY???|"After the previous head &amp; shoulders SPY pattern completed yesterday, I noticed the bottom yesterday formed a near horizontal neckline with the bottom of July 26.  We have a left shoulder on July 22 just above 400.  So I was thinking today would be a good day to have the right shoulder form especially with the 50 DMA at 401-ish.

Sure enough, SPY got rejected at the 50 DMA and now we have the right shoulder.  To be clear, right now this is just a *potential* h&amp;s pattern.  To fully form, SPY now needs to drop significantly below 390 which may be where it is currently headed.  To void the pattern, SPY would need to rise above 401 significantly.  

Here's the exciting part, if the h&amp;s forms, to complete the pattern SPY would have to drop below 350, a new low and a level a lot of bears have been watching.  I'm sure this is definitely something technical traders, HFs and algos are watching."|0.39|0|0|0

I made a lot of money in capital gains last year and sold everything in December, and those realized gains are easily seen using TD Ameritrade’s cost basis feature. Well, you know what happened next - I tried to catch falling knives from January through March and lost it all, plus some. Now  my goal is to just break even (the taxes I paid will be separate - maybe an expensive lesson). However, when I check my realized and unrealized gains and losses for this year, I’m seeing a lot of ‘wash sale adjustments’. I’m not worried about taking profits at the moment since I lost so much money at the beginning of the year, and again, I’m just trying to break even (which I’m getting close to doing), so I often trade with stops that hit. My question - can I trust those realized and unrealized numbers in the cost basis screen of TD Ameritrade?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

It's invested at about 60/40 ETFs/mutual funds. As we are all aware, the markets have been exceptionally volatile, and I believe that we're going to see a steady slide/decline into a recession (at the very least) over the next year or so due to the Fed's guidance, continued inflation, loss of trust in the government (with regards to changing recession definitions), etc. 

With that being said, I am obviously very interested in maintaining the value of the portfolio, and reinvesting the cash once we see a significant decline in the market (id assume around 6-12 months). However, total average gain for the portfolio is around 15%. My assumption is that I'd end up paying capital gains on that 15%. My questions for you guys are:

1) would you recommend that I cash out and reinvest once the market has dropped into recession territory?

2) would I end up paying a huge chunk in taxes if I did this? And if so, is there any way to reduce/remove my tax liability?

# The Market is a River You Endure

Imagine someone who enjoys white-water rafting. This is someone who sits on a raft and uses their paddle to influence their direction as they make their way down a river. White-water rafting is pretty simple, really, but that doesn't mean it's always easy. In fact there are *six class of white water,* each one more dangerous than the next. Class 1 and 2 are for floating and soaking in nature while Class 4 is an aggressive adventure (and Class 6 represents extreme danger, taking the lives of some of the most experienced athletes).

And here's the thing: *Regardless of the class of white-water, the rafter always has the same paddle.* *But that paddle doesn't influence their direction as much with more aggressive waters.* The more difficult the water the more strategy, planning, experience, and fitness are required to traverse the river. Sound familiar?

Strategy... Planning... Experience... Fitness (Capital)

# The Problem

**Now back to trading:**

We've all heard the statistic: 95% of traders don't prosper long term. There's lots of reasons why this might have some merit, but one of them is traders not fully understanding the market in which they paddle. The river is going to take you where it wants. *You can only maneuver between the rocks.*

Imagine not knowing which class of water you're about to carve through? Class 6 will rip your arms off. And I'm telling you right now that this right here is a good analogy for a trader who completely ignores economic catalysts and overall trends.

Traders like you and me can benefit from understanding which ""class"" of market they are in. There are times when volatility is low and times where it is high. Even worse, there are times when volatility is \*impending\* and traders don't know what is going to happen. Which brings us to the point of this post:

# Economic Data Drops: How to Take Advantage

Let's start with some data that is applicable today.

Non-farm Payrolls and Unemployment data **comes out tomorrow (September 2nd, 2022)**. This represents one of the most important pieces of economic data. Period. This happens every first-Friday of the month. I'd argue it is even more important during this season of inflation and supply issues.

I'm going to use a lot of super great explanations from Graeme Watkins, CEO of Valutrades Limited (of which I have no affiliation), to illustrate how day traders can benefit from digesting this kind of information.

**What advantages does Non-Farm Payroll data offer traders?**

# Advantage #1: Find Volume and Volatility

Just knowing the date of these drops helps **identify volume and volatility shifts**. After the report hits tomorrow before open, you'll notice a rise in market activity. Having a handy economic calendar for significant news helps traders game plan for a high volatility environment.

We've all been there. You do your research. You have a plan. You're ready to go... And then... ""Wtf was that?! You seeing this volume?!"" That never actually goes away completely (lol, life) but you can prevent surprises and game plan differently by knowing when these data drops occur.

I love this app for economic calendar (again, no affiliation).

[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trading-economics/id1142178921](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trading-economics/id1142178921)

# Advantage #2: Find Momentum Sectors and Hot Stocks Early

Most traders are late to a trend and find just a fraction of a run to take advantage of, missing a huge chunk of the whole move. What if you could capture the lion's share of it instead of a tiny slice?

Well, traders can **identify momentum sectors and hot stocks early** with thanks to a (somewhat) predictable market rotation from NFP data. And of course momentum can present clean trends for larger profits and safety against pullbacks.

How?

Well, to be overly simple, changing rates affect business decisions, manufacturing, and distribution. These changes in business operations have a butterfly affect of sorts that represent headwinds and tailwinds for affiliated industries. This is provided by the guts of the NFP data which is that that we get to learn about the ""total number of paid U.S. workers of any registered business; exclusions to this figure include private household employees, employees of nonprofit organizations, general government employees, and—as you can probably already gather—farm employees.""

**Notable tickers to watch** during the data drop: DXY, USD/EUR, VIX.

# Advantage #3: Leverage Group-think Self-Fulfilling Prophecies

We all know trading is a *psychological jungle.* Wouldn't it be nice to have a bead on the general sentiment in the market? **Being aware of current trends and ""group-think"" offers an enormous edge**. Take advantage of the psychological aspect of the market. Because you see...

&gt;""When jobs are increasing in number, sentiment within the market generates momentum, with consumers having more disposable income and, thus, spending more... An increase in user spending has always been a factor behind USD performance, even if its impact is often understated.""

*Side note: With this quoted, it should be known that right now* ***good news is bad news*** *since the labor market and spending is part of the reason inflation is still white hot. But that's another chat for another time, one that I am sure would be an energetic conversation.*

When traders are aware of shifts in sentiment or socially trending topics, they can find where volume and volatility are, representing opportunities for profit. And if they understand the data, they can make smart choices on their strategies as it relates to direction and risk/reward evaluations.

**Tracking Social Sentiment Manually**

There are cool websites that track keyword mentions across the internet. Watch how the words ""unemployment, inflation, and recession"" spike after the data drop tomorrow. I like this one (no affiliation): [https://www.wordtracker.com/search?query=recession](https://www.wordtracker.com/search?query=recession)

# What about you?

These are just a few quick ways that I feel traders can benefit from watching and digesting financial data. If you'd like to learn more about the impacts of financial data like this, I have some resources I'm happy to share, but I'd like to hear from everyone else. Tell us your magic sauce.

Thanks for reading. Happy trading. Long live /r/stocks!

t3_x3at6w|1662046794|stocks|Apple already decimated Meta’s ad-tech empire. Now, it’s homing in on Facebook’s advertisers, too.|"In terms of Silicon Valley feuds, you’d be hard pressed to find one that’s spicier than the years-long battle between Meta and Apple. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg started steering his company toward virtual-reality tech, and now Apple CEO Tim Cook has made it clear he’s gunning for the same. Meta’s Facebook recently started testing out encrypted chats, a domain that Apple has dominated for years. 

Facebook is a company that historically hasn’t shied away from sharing user data with countless third parties. Meanwhile Apple AAPL, -0.67%, as its own glitzy ad campaigns constantly remind us, is the one tech company that doesn’t spray your data across the web. And, of course, there’s Apple’s recent privacy changes to its operating system that wiped out an estimated $10 billion of revenue for Meta META, -0.54%. At the same time, the advertisers that relied on the long-established tools on Facebook and Instagram were left without the data they long relied on for their businesses.

In the year since Apple CEO Tim Cook denounced ad-based business models as a source of real-world violence, Apple has ramped up plans to pop more ads into people’s iPhones and beef up the tech used to target those ads. And now it looks like Apple’s looking to poach the small businesses that have relied almost entirely on Facebook’s ad platform for more than a decade. MarketWatch found two recent job postings by Apple that suggest the company is looking to build out its burgeoning ad-tech team with folks who specialize in working with small businesses. Specifically, the company says it’s looking for two product managers who are “inspired to make a difference in how digital advertising will work in a privacy-centric world” and who want to “design and build consumer advertising experiences.” An ideal candidate, Apple said, won’t only be savvy in advertising and mobile tech, and advertising on mobile tech, but will also have experience with “performance marketing, local ads or enabling small businesses.” 

The listings also state that Apple’s looking for a manager who can “drive multi-year strategy and execution,” which suggests that Apple isn’t just tailing local advertisers but will likely be tailing those advertisers for a while. And considering how some of those small brands are already looking to jump ship from Facebook following Apple’s privacy changes, luring them off the platform might be enough to hamper Meta’s entire business structure for good, ad-tech analysts said. “If you talk to any small business, they’ll tell you, ‘Yeah, right now is a disaster,” said Eric Seufert, one analyst who’s been following the battle between Apple and Facebook evolve for  years. “It’s just a meltdown. There’s been a complete, devastating change to the environment.”

# [Stock futures fall to start September as market reels on worries of rising rates](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/31/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Thursday, the first day of September, as traders continued to fret over the potential for higher Federal Reserve rates.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 143 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The moves came as the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 3.516%, the highest level since November 2007, at one point Thursday.
*****
&gt; Nvidia shares also contributed to the losses, falling more than 5% in premarket trading after the chipmaker said the U.S. government is restricting some sales in China.
*****
&gt; The major averages are coming off four straight days of losses. On Wednesday, the final day of August, the Dow slid nearly 0.9%. The S&amp;P 500 lost about 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell roughly 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The Dow closed the month down about 4.1%, while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq recorded losses of 4.2% and 4.6%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Investors are debating whether stocks will again challenge the June lows in September, a historically poor month for markets, after weighing recent hawkish comments from Fed officials who show no signs of easing up on interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; “If we retest the lows, I think it happens in September,” SoFi’s Liz Young said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” However, she added, “I think in order to do so, something would have to get materially worse than it was on June 16,” when stocks bottomed, such as earnings revisions that come in worse than investors are expecting.

t3_x35t0z|1662033658|stocks|Don't fight the fed advice|"With so many people trying desperately holding on to any good news lately, remember don't fight the fed and don't fight the trend.

If jobs number is good the fed will take it as a sign there's more room to increase rates. If GDP grows or stagnates they will take it as a sign for manuever.

The Fed was clear they want to fight inflation and will bring pain to the market companies and households for it.

But don't take my word for it take Jerome Powell word:

""While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,"" he said. ""These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.""

Even with four consecutive interest rate hikes, including two back-to-back 75-basis-point increases, Powell stressed that the Fed is not in a place to ""stop or pause"" — an unwelcome sign for investors who were predicting a rate cut next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

So next time you see a rally based on jobs numbers or GDP or whatever remember the fed will take it as a sign to keep increasing rates.

**Overall the economy is screaming pain but crazy and late investors just want to grab some short gains, and my advice is don't fight the fed and don't fight the trend**"|0.91|582|0|582

Only alarming thing I saw on the earnings reports is stock based compensation is rather high. Company has never missed an earnings anticipation. Growing at a rate of around 30% YoY which is tremendous growth. 

I feel if they toned down SBC they could be profitable rather quickly. The problem is they've been focused on growth for so long the CEO hasn't flipped the switch yet towards profitably. He said the company anticipates profitability by of Q3 2023. The company has always delivered on guidance and has a good track record, so I believe him. 

As of right now TWLO is getting beat down with the rest of tech and speculative unprofitable growth companies.

The move comes just days after 3M suffered a setback over a key legal strategy designed to mitigate mounting liabilities and as it faces an array of other challenges, ranging from inflationary woes to sluggish growth. 

Michael Vale, head of 3M’s safety and industrial division, disclosed the planned cuts in a message to employees of the unit. “The business can’t avoid this tough necessity,” he said in the communication, which was reviewed by Bloomberg News. 

The scope of the workforce reduction couldn’t be immediately determined, but in the memo Vale said other parts of the company would see similar actions. 3M, which makes everything from dental adhesives to Post-it notes, employed about 95,000 people at the end of 2021, according to securities filings.

“3M is taking decisive actions to position the company for continued growth, while also adjusting to the challenging macroeconomic environment,” the company said in a statement, without being more specific. “As we prioritize our investments and resources, we will be adjusting on an ongoing basis the roles and responsibilities needed for future growth.”

The multinational manufacturer has underperformed in recent years amid supply-chain snags, currency fluctuations and rising costs. 3M said in July it will spin off its health-care operation, which accounted for almost a quarter of sales. Management also cut its full-year sales and profit outlook.

It also potentially faces billions of dollars in future costs tied to environmental liabilities and lawsuits alleging that it sold faulty combat earplugs to the US military that led to hearing damage. A bankruptcy judge last week rejected 3M’s attempt to use controversial bankruptcy rules to halt those claims, allowing them to proceed to trial. 3M has said it plans to appeal the ruling.

The company’s safety and industrial division plans to realign and reduce its structure, streamline its portfolio and rethink business processes, as well as eliminate jobs, according to the message. It is 3M’s largest business unit by revenue and accounted for 34% of its $35.4 billion in sales last year.

It also operates other divisions, selling a variety of products in the consumer, transportation and electronics markets.

[Pure Storage](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/PSTG?mod=MW_story_quote) shares are trading higher after the storage company posted better results than expected in a quarter that challenged some other companies serving the enterprise market.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and [Cisco Systems](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/CSCO?mod=MW_story_quote) (CSCO) turned in solid recent results, but the numbers were softer from Dell Technologies (DELL), [HP Inc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/HPQ?mod=MW_story_quote). (HPQ), and others. Earlier Wednesday, the disk-drive maker [Seagate](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/STX?mod=MW_story_quote) (STX) [reduced its full year guidance](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/seagate-cuts-first-quarter-revenue-outlook-51661950149), citing softening demand from some data-center and cloud customers.

Yet Pure sailed through, showing little damage from big-picture issues.

For its fiscal second quarter, ended Aug. 7, Pure reported revenue of $646.8 million, up 30% from a year earlier, and ahead of [management’s forecast of $635 million](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/pure-storage-stock-price-earnings-51654121635). On an adjusted basis, the company earned 32 cents a share, a dime ahead of Wall Street expectations. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the company earned 4 cents a share, up from a loss of 16 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin in the quarter was 16.4%, well above the company’s target of 11.8%.

Pure reported annual recurring revenue of $953.3 million, up 31%, with remaining performance obligations of $1.5 billion, up 25% from a year ago. The company bought back $61 million of stock in the quarter, ending the period with $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

Pure is projecting fiscal third-quarter revenue of $670 million, above the Street consensus forecast of $651 million, with a non-GAAP operating margin of 12.7%. For the January 2023 fiscal year, the company now sees revenue of $2.75 billion, up from a previous forecast of $2.66 billion. Pure now projects full year non-GAAP operating margin of 14%, up from a previous forecast of 12%.

CEO Charlie Giancarlo said in an interview with *Barron’s* that Pure had “an excellent quarter,” pointing to 31% growth in annual revenue for Pure’s subscription business. “We had strong operating margins, good cash flow, and good net new logo growth,” he said, referring to companies signing on as customers.

Giancarlo said Pure continues to see strong growth from cloud customers. He said that while the company is seeing the sales cycle slow a little at some customers, “the market has stayed reasonably strong” overall. He said he expects that Pure can continue to grow faster than the rest of the market whether or not there is a recession.

Asked about the higher-than-expected operating margin in the quarter, Giancarlo said that expenses were a little lower than anticipated due to slower than expected hiring in the period"|0.92|17|0|17

Short interest is pretty high that'll make this stock volatile on most days.

Mester anticipates the rate increases to slow economic growth, which she sees as running “well below 2%.”

Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said Wednesday she sees interest rates rising considerably higher before the central bank can ease off in its fight against inflation.

Mester, a voting member this year of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said she sees benchmark rates rising above 4% in the coming months. That’s well above the current target range of 2.25%-2.5% for the federal funds rate, which sets what banks charge each other for overnight borrowing but is tied to many consumer debt instruments.

“My current view is that it will be necessary to move the fed funds rate up to somewhat above 4 percent by early next year and hold it there,” she said in prepared remarks for a speech in Dayton. “I do not anticipate the Fed cutting the fed funds rate target next year.”

In line with that, Mester said rates will remain elevated “for some time,” a phrase used in recent days by both Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and New York Fed President John Williams. She said real rates, or the difference between the fed funds rate and inflation, will need to “move into positive territory.”

The Fed this year has raised rates four times for a total of 2.25 percentage points. Markets are pricing in a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase at the September meeting and looking for rate cuts to start in the fall of 2023.

Mester said she anticipates the rate increases to slow economic growth, which she sees as running “well below 2%” while the unemployment rate rises and financial markets remain volatile. She expects inflation to fall to a range of 5%-6% this year and then get closer to the Fed’s target in subsequent years.

In one concession to those looking for lower rates, she said she does not think the Fed necessarily will have to keep raising rates until inflation hits the central bank’s 2% goal. But she said policymakers must remain vigilant.

“It would be a mistake to declare victory over the inflation beast too soon. Doing so would put us back in the stop-and-go monetary policy world of the 1970s, which was very costly to households and businesses,” she said.

*****

# [Stock futures tick higher as Wall Street tries to recover from third straight day of losses](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were slightly higher Wednesday after Wall Street’s losing streak stretched into its third day and endangered the market’s recent summer rebound.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 25 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures advanced 0.3%. Nasdaq 100 futures outperformed, advancing 0.7%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Chewy tumbled more than 11% in the premarket after the pet products retailer issued weak revenue guidance. HP Inc’s stock dipped 6% after the company missed revenue estimates.
*****
&gt; Investors have sold off heavily since Friday after hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Most recently, New York Fed President John Williams called for “somewhat restrictive policy to slow demand.”
*****
&gt; The sell-off on Wall Street rolled into Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sliding nearly 1%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.1%, and the S&amp;P 500 slumped 1.1%, falling below the 4,000 mark for the first time since late July. All the major averages were on pace to finish August with losses.
*****
&gt; Despite Tuesday’s sell-off and hawkish Fed remarks, some investors are hopeful that the rate hiking cycle could be nearing its end.
*****
&gt; “We think we’re close to the end of this rate-hiking cycle, but it certainly depends on a lot of things,” Brenda Vingiello, chief investment officer of Sand Hill Global Advisors said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Tuesday. “No doubt the Fed’s gonna raise rates in September, and likely two more times this year, but they will have at that point done a lot and we will be in restrictive territory.”
*****
&gt; Ahead of Friday’s closely watched August jobs data, more Fed speeches are slated for Wednesday. Chicago PMI and ADP employment data are also due out in the morning.
*****
&gt; Wednesday’s also the last trading day of the month. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are both down more than 3% in August, while the Nasdaq has lost 4% in that time.

Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, -0.71% BRK.A, -0.83% said in a regulatory filing Tuesday with the Hong Kong stock exchange that it had sold 1.33 million of its BYD shares for roughly $47 million ($368.8 million Hong Kong dollars). Berkshire paid $232 million for the 225 million BYD shares it bought in 2008. By the end of last year, the value of those shares had ballooned to nearly $7.7 billion. The success of the BYD investment is one example of why so many investors follow Buffett’s moves closely because he has a remarkably successful track record over the decades. BYD said in an earnings report this week that sales of its vehicles continued to climb in the first half of this year and help it increase market share, even as auto sales slowed in its home market of China. BYD said its revenue jumped nearly 66% in the first half of this year thanks to the rapid growth in its electric vehicle sales, and its net income more than tripled to $520 million (3.6 billion yuan).

Berkshire said it owned about 7.7% of BYD before the latest stock sales, and that figure won’t change much after the sales. Berkshire said its holdings of the Hong Kong-issued shares of BYD dipped slightly from 20.49% to 19.92%. In the past, Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger have heaped praise on BYD Chairman and founder Wang Chanfu and said they were investing in him even more than in BYD’s technology. Munger has said that Wang managed to accomplish several feats that seemed impossible at the time, including taking one-third of the lithium battery market away from Japanese manufacturers by 2010.

Buffett even took the rare step of visiting a BYD factory in China in 2010 to demonstrate his support for the company. Hdidn’t immediately respond Tuesday to questions about the BYD stock sale. Besides investments, Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns more than 90 companies outright including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an eclectic assortment of retail and manufacturing companies such as Dairy Queen, Helzberg Diamonds and Precision Castparts.

Many analysts and journalists love to talk about market headwinds as being priced in.  As if anything bad that may happen is, of course, already known and accounted for.  While this is somewhat true, there's a lot of money to be made gambling on these future scenarios. The hope of threading the needle between a soft recession and a hopefully dovish FED seemed fairly strong, until Jackson Hole and reports like the two above.  Headwinds being priced in are just as mush as a crystal ball reading as anyone trying to time the market.

I'm optimistic overall, but I see a steady hangover phase after the last two (or 10+) years of loose monitary policy. For a while now its been ""bad news is good news and good news is good news"", now it's more like ""bad news and good news is bad news"".

Did tons of macro economic research in the last two weeks, stared at charts to watch volume and understand market sentiment, checking 1s order sizes to see larger players enter or exit, etc.

I timed the top of the market when I saw AMZN  (and the rest of the market) do a quick jitter down on the day of the top. Other people noticed it too but brushed it off. The medium sized sell made the price of AMZN, QQQ, SPY, etc move down way too much for the size of the liquidation. I took this as a sign of the market being very fragile and oversold so I sold all my AMZN (with margin).

Next day, market started it’s descent. This caused me to do all the aforementioned research because I’ve lost my money before on the first 2022 crash and I understand how important capital protection is now. I decided to be bearish on the market as a whole.

I decided that Jackson hole speech would be a catalyst for a huge change in the markets because of what the fed was saying vs how the greedy market was acting and not believing the fed and how they were pricing in a fantasy. Blackrock convinced me a bit too, since I’m sure they would be greedy if the risk was low, but they were ultra bearish.

I place my 130P SEP 2 puts, two nights before jackson hole, unfortunately AMZN went up 2.6% the next day. If this didn’t happen I should’ve been up $120k from the beginning.

Anyway, I kept buying and liquidating my put positions as the market ebbed and flowed down. I stopped today because I saw the inverse of what happened on the top of the market: very very low volume market buys we’re keeping the market up. The market should’ve been destroyed today, with the sell volume, but since the top side of the market is all wiped out, there are now huge gaps in ask sizes, causing it to moon upwards with ease. Another possible $100k+ day. I was up 35k and I waited out the action, until the aforementioned was too strong. Ended at 15k profit for the day.

Now ive deleted my trading app and I will time the housing market bottom and buy a nice 3 bedroom house for $600,000 CAD with a 20% down payment :) Which will be the equivalent to an $800,000 house right now, pre-upcoming-crash

t3_x1zjmq|1661906576|stocks|I think everyone is still sleeping on lithium mining companies|"Tesla has the ambitious plan of selling 20 million cars year after year starting from 2030, the amount of lithium that you need to sell that many cars is about 1,2 million tons of lithium and the amount of lithium that we were expected to have by 2030 is anywhere from 1.8 to 1.9 million tons of lithium. that measure can easily be estimated based on current reserves, upcoming projects and battery recycling.

The leading researcher in the mineral space for electric vehicles benchmark minerals intelligence estimates that we will only have one 1.8 million tons of lithium by 2030. 

Lithium extraction is not something that can be fast tracked it actually takes on average 7 to 10 years to bring lithium from the ground into the markets, in 2019 we only mined under 400,000 tons of lithium.

Every car manufacturer globally is planning on selling tens of millions of electric cars, Tesla is really the only car manufacturer that has a supply chain figure it out and can source as much Lithium as it can get his hands on, where will the rest of other car manufacturer source enough lithium?

We will be faced with a massive Lithium shortage, lithium is already becoming the new oil and when we couple the fact that there will be a massive shortage for electric vehicles and energy storage the vast amount of wealth that will be generated in the future in my humble opinion is from Junior mining companies. China is way ahead of the United States and has recognized this problem which is why they have invested heavily into mining in other countries.

The money that is made in this electric vehicle revolution are from the companies that own the land and mine for the most important commodity of our green revolution future, lithium. Not from the electric car companies themselves. 

Companies like Sigma lithium, liontown resources, lake resources, are surging thousands of percent without even having extracted one grain of lithium. When they start to sell lithium they will take off even further.

There are a ton of Junior companies out there that have massive potential in my humble opinion the best ones are Brazil Minerals, Sayona mining, Atlantic lithium, lake resources, Piedmont lithium.

I know people who try to do this full time who are smart and have the financial means to buy up tens of thousands of dollars of stock to try and buy then sell shortly after. Every single one of these people has a net loss from starting this. There are 14 of them I know - not a single one has come out ahead. Talk about not beating the odds. 

Here is the truth r/stocks folks: If you and I were bickering back in ***May 2002*** that AAPL would be dipping from its high of **$0.45** we would have been right. AAPL did in fact go down to **$0.33** in ***July 2002.*** Had you bought puts on AAPL at the right time in 2002 - yay for you. If you had tried to swing trade AAPL in 2002 you would have probably gotten burnt, but maybe not. 

Listen: The fact is the best thing you could have done is to have poured $1,000 into AAPL at anytime in 2002 and held for the next 20 years until today, even with AAPL taking a dip recently. You would have more than 300X you original cash invested. 

We can do the same thing with the more conservative way of investing, ETFs, since most experienced investors on r/stocks like these more than individual stocks (including myself). Let us take a look at a popular ETF you and I would know as SPY. SPY right now is worth $398. Sure, SPY was at $474 back in December 2021 and man it should ""would have been nice to have sold then"". . . ***April 2002 SPY trading at $119. December 2002 $87.*** 

My point with this post is simple: Buy, hold and enjoy your life. I am not saying buy and hold crappy high risk companies. Pour 75% of your portfolio in things like SPY, VOO and QQQ and don't touch them for decades. Hell, don't even look at them.

# Snap plans to lay off 20 percent of employees

*Snap’s stock price has declined nearly 80 percent this year*

 Snap is planning to lay off approximately 20 percent of its more than 6,400 employees, according to people familiar with the matter.

The layoffs, which [Snap has been planning](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/8/23297637/snap-snapchat-layoff-plans-weak-q2-earnings) for the past several weeks, will begin on Wednesday and hit some departments harder than others, the people said. For example, the team working on [ways for developers to build mini apps and games](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21286537/snap-minis-snapchat-partner-summit-2020-announcements) inside Snapchat will be severely impacted. Zenly, [the social mapping app](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192741/snapchat-zenly-app-stay-at-home-leaderboard-coronavirus-social-distancing) Snap bought in 2017 and has since run separately, will also see deep cuts.

Another team that will see layoffs is Snap’s hardware division, which is responsible for [Spectacles](https://www.theverge.com/22819963/snap-ar-spectacles-glasses-hands-on-pictures-design-features) and the Pixy camera drone [that was recently canceled](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/18/23311542/snap-pixy-drone-giving-up-four-months) after being on sale for just a few months. The company’s ad sales organization is also being restructured.

Russ Caditz-Peck, a Snap spokesperson, declined to comment.

Snap’s stock price has lost nearly 80 percent of its value since the beginning of this year, and [the company said in May](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/23/23138778/snap-plans-to-slow-hiring-warns-slow-revenue-growth) that it would slow hiring and look for ways to cut costs.

t3_x1qk4w|1661884106|stocks|Did the economy actually shrink in the first half of 2022?|"The answer is probably not.

Everyone knows that we’ve had two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth but could the GDP numbers be wrong. It sounds like a silly conspiratorial question but it’s actually an entirely necessary one because there’s more than one way to take measure of economic output.

Enter Gross Domestic Income: GDI is measured as of all the income an economy produces for each quarter. This number should produce the exact same results as GDP and any difference is just a statistical discrepancy/data collection error. Since all money that is spent ends up somewhere GDP, a measure of what is spent should equal GDI a measure of all income but that has not been the case for the first two quarters of 2022.

Q1 GDP growth: -1.6%
Q2 GDP growth: -0.6%

Q1 GDI growth: 1.8%
Q2 GDI growth: 1.4%

This is one of the largest divergences ever recorded.

These results paint very different pictures of the same economy. GDI says the economy continues to grow albeit slowly and that the Fed can continue to hike rates aggressively whereas GDP says we’re already in a technical recession.

I’m more inclined to believe that GDI is closer to the truth given that corporate profits hit all time highs and unemployment is back at its lowest in 50 years. Q2 corporate profits exceeded 3 trillion for the first time and were more than 11% higher than in Q4 of 2021. The economy also added 3.3 million jobs for an average of 470k per month so far this year.

But even if you reasonably believed the answer was somewhere in the middle, an average of the two numbers would produce a positive growth rate in each of the first two quarters.

Averaged growth rate: Q1 0.1%, Q2 0.6%

Some Fed economists have even argued that GDI may be a better measure as this was clearly the case during the Great Recession where initial GDP estimates ended up being far off later estimates.

https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/march/better-measurement-output-gdp-gdi


All this to mean that if the National Bureau of Economic Research does declare a recession at some point in the next year or so I’d bet that the start date would not be in the first 7 months of 2022 and that the Fed can still hike rates a lot more.

Overall: Bearish, the economic pain hasn’t even started yet."|0.76|9|0|9

t3_x1nwsu|1661877811|stocks|Radio isn't dead...…yet|"Hi All!

I have come across a ""Special Situation"" in the broadcasting sector, Saga Communications. Below is my investment memo. Remember, do your own diligence, this isn't investment advice.

**Saga Communications (SGA: NASDAQ)**

Date 8/30/2022

Current Price: $28

Target Price: $36.95

Implied Upside: 34%

&amp;#x200B;

**Abstract and Investment Thesis**

**Abstract**

I believe Saga Communications (SGA) which currently trades at $28/share is undervalued. My target price of $36.95 implies a 34% upside.

SGA shares are attractively priced given the following catalysts:

Super voting control by the former CEO has been terminated due to his passing

Dual share class has collapsed into one share class

Near-term revenue growth driven by mid-term political advertising spend

**Investment Thesis**

Given the above catalysts, I believe SGA is uniquely situated for an activist investor to emerge or a competitor to acquire the company in the near-term.

**COMPANY BACKGROUND**

Saga Communications, Inc. is a broadcast company whose business is primarily devoted to acquiring, developing, and operating radio stations. Saga currently owns or operates broadcast properties in 27 markets, including 79 FM and 35 AM radio stations. Saga Communications is located in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan.

Saga's strategy is to operate top billing radio stations in mid-sized markets, defined as markets ranked (by market revenues) from 20 to 200. Saga's radio stations employ a myriad of programming formats, including Active Rock, Adult Album Alternative, Adult Contemporary, Country, and others.

Saga began operations in 1986 and became a publicly traded company in December 1992.

SGA employs 570 full-time individuals and 227 part-time individuals.

SGA owns and operates over 100 radio licenses.

SGA operates in 27 markets including: Columbus, Milwaukee, Norfolk, Des Moines, Charleston, and Ocala FL.

**COMPANY BACKGROUND**

Saga decentralizes the corporate brand from each local station. This allows the local stations to build their own brand outside of the corporate enterprise and create long-term community goodwill in their respective cities.

In addition to the decentralized corporate enterprise, Saga focuses on winning local advertisement accounts over national advertising accounts. In larger markets, national advertising is less personable as the ad accounts will come from well established companies like General Motors, Apple and Proctor and Gamble.

Focusing on local advertising gives the Saga team an opportunity to build a reputation with small businesses — establishing community goodwill. This decentralized system has given the Company a competitive advantage over larger radio companies in the area who tend to focus more on larger national accounts.

The Company has consistently generated \~$125 million in revenues, \~$25 million in EBITDA and \~$20 million in free cash flow.

Saga Communications operates radio stations in the top 30 – 200 markets. SGA markets are located in the Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast.

Within SGA’s top seven markets, their radio stations are ranked from 1st to 5th in listenership (Nielsen's Audio Ranking).

Of SGA’s 100+ radio licenses, 33 were up for renewal in 2022. These licenses have either been re-granted or are pending approval by the FCC. All other SGA licenses expire in 2027, 2028, or 2029.

**MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW**

Edward Christian was the CEO of Saga Communications for over 2 decades before he passed away in August 2022.

Warren Lada: Interim CEO. Formerly COO of Saga Communications and a current board member.

Samuel Bush: CFO. Has been with the company for over a decade.

Christopher Forgy: SVP Operations

**MARKET OVERVIEW**

SGA operates in the radio sector. Radio listenership has remained consistent up until 2020. In 2020, 83% of Americans ages 12 or older listened to terrestrial radio in a given week, a figure that dropped slightly from 89% in 2019. The decrease coincided with a sharp decrease in automobile use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

More than 244.5 million American adults listen to the radio each month. Audiences are becoming more diverse with more than 45 million Hispanic listeners and more than 35 million Black listeners a month.

Competitors include: Townsquare Media, Audacy, Cumulus, iHeart, Spanish broadcasting, and others.

Broadcasting companies can only own up to 8 stations within a specific market. FCC licenses are granted based upon a two-step renewal process. The FCC must find the radio license was used to serve the public interest and secondly no serious violations occurred.

Marketing analytics firm Cross Screen Media had been projecting a bullish $8.8 billion in advertising buys for the 2022 midterms (by way of comparison, spending was $9.5 billion during the 2020 presidential election and $3.9 billion for the 2018 midterms).

As of August 1st, 2022, $3.6bn has been spent on mid-term elections.

Radio advertising spend has totaled $100m as of August.

**GROWTH DRIVERS (Catalysts)**

**Super voting control by the former CEO has been terminated due to his passing**

Ed Christian held 100% of SGA’s Class B stock. Class B stock had super voting control. This allowed Ed to control all company and board decisions.

Class A shares received 1 vote per share. Class B shares received 10 votes per share.

Upon the death of Ed Christian, his Class B shares will transition to Class A shares, thus dissolving the dual classes and super voting control.

**Dual share class has collapsed into one share class**

The radio sector has historically had a dual share class and super voting structure.

SGA will now be one of the only radio stocks with a single share class and no super voting control.

With a single share class and no super-voting control, SGA is ripe for an activist investor to take a position or for an acquisition by other media companies or PE.

Townsquare Media: TSQ has two classes of shares with Class B receiving 10 votes pers share.

Cumulus: Class A and Class B stock.

Audacy: Class A, B, and C stock.

iHeart Radio: Class A and Class B stock.

**Near-term revenue growth driven by mid-term political advertising spend**

Mid-term elections are held in November 2022.

Political advertising spend is expected to top the 2018 mid-terms and 2020 presidential election.

Mid-term elections drive increased local advertising spend more than national.

Sinclair, Townsquare, Cumulus, and others have signaled strong Q3 and Q4 numbers driven by political revenue in recently earnings calls.

**FINANCIALS**

Annual revenue peaked in 2016 at $142m. In 2020, revenue declined significantly to $95m.

Radio listenership is highly tied to automobile use. With no one driving in 2020, it caused advertising revenue to decline.

Annual revenue has since recovered in 2021 and 2022.

Total gross revenue resulting from national advertising in fiscal 2021 was approximately $13,138,000 or 12% of SGA’s gross revenue

Revenue has recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Digital revenue has grown from $3.7m in 2019 to $6.3m in 2021. 2022 is projected to generate $8.7m.

Edward Christian’s average annual cash compensation was: $2.1m (Interim CEO salary of $750K).

SGA’s annual historic SG&amp;A was $10m. A reduction of Edward’s salary will have a significant and immediate impact on EBITDA.

EPS has historically been positive up to 2020. EPS has since recovered.

SGA has no long-term debt: “On October 27, 2021, we used $10 million from funds generated by operations to voluntarily pay down the remaining amount on our Revolving Credit Facility.”

SGA has $54m in cash.

SGA pays, on average, a $.20 cent quarterly dividend.

**INVESTMENT THESIS**

I believe SGA is situated for an activist investor or acquisition in the near-term.

The collapse of dual share classes and removal of super-voting control opens SGA to new investors.

SGA’s fixed assets generate significant free cash flow and with zero debt, SGA could be appealing for PE or a competitor to acquire them.

SGA’s largest shareholder is Towerview LLC at 22%. Towerview could acquired SGA or force a sales process.

Towerview is 100% controlled by the Tisch family. The Tisch family own the Loews Hotel company along with a variety of other companies and the New York Giants (net worth is $6bn). Towerview LLC is managed by Daniel Tisch. Saga Communications is the second largest holding of Towerview LLC.

With super-voting control dissolved, it opens a variety of ways management, or an activist investor could generate value:

Issue a special dividend

Restart their share repurchase program

Increase their own M&amp;A activity

Dividend recap

Sale lease back on towers and real estate

Increase their quarterly dividend

**VALUATION &amp; COMPS**

SGA currently trades evenly to its sector peers and certain median multiples. SGA is trading on a lower EV/EBITDA multiple compared to peers and the sector. SGA trades at a 20% discount on a median TTM EV/EBITDA multiple compared to radio peer comps.

SGA is also one of the only radio stocks to pay a dividend.

SGA’s share priced increased 12%+ on August 19th due to the CEO passing.

The median EV/EBITDA multiple for acquisitions is 8.5x. This is based on historical transactions.

I used a Sum of the Parts analysis to value Saga Communications. I came to a value through splitting the parts into the operating business, real estate, and towers. Radio stocks have typically been valued based on an EV/EBITDA multiple. SGA’s current market cap is $165m.

Using historical data, I projected revenue to reach $117m in 2022 and EBITDA to reach $23.5m.

I used SGA’s current land value, building value, and tower value. SGA’s land value has most likely not been grossed up to reflect today’s value. I assumed SGA’s buildings are overvalued due to their age. I assumed SGA’s tower value is undervalued based on historic transaction comps. I removed Equipment, furniture, and vehicles from my valuation

**Downside Risk**

If no catalyst emerges driving SGA’s share price upward, the downside risk is low.

Downside risk is mitigated by potentially robust political revenue in Q3 and Q4, and the stock’s 100 day moving average of $23.97. This implies a downside of 13%.

Saga Communications traded between $30-$35/share in 2019 before COVID. Since Oct 2020, SGA has been on an upward trend.

**INVESTMENT MERITS &amp; RISKS**

**Merits**

Experienced management team.

Strong business fundamentals.

Political advertising cycle in the near-term.

Only radio stock with one share class.

Termination of super-voting control.

Private equity dry powder is higher than any point in history.

Historic consolidation in the radio sector.

**Risks**

Macro environment continues to worsen. A recession decreases advertising/marketing spend.

Private equity lags public markets and could significantly scale back M&amp;A activity.

Rate increase will increase the cost of debt.

Interim CEO transitions to FT CEO.

Management and board don’t act and let the interim CEO run the business as before.

Radio continues to slowly lose advertising dollar share.

Digital revenue grows slower than expected and doesn’t make up for lost Radio revenue.

Low trading volume. Average daily volume is 10K shares. Large purchases could have a significant impact on our entry and exit price.

t3_x1m64a|1661873658|stocks|Averaging doesn't increase risk-adjusted returns; it increases your chances of breaking even but increases your losses if you don't.|"I repeatedly see people on this sub saying that one should keep buying in order to average down when they've experienced losses.  Sometimes this is good advice, but it all depends on the merits of the stock itself.  *A priori*, however, it doesn't do what many people think it does.

Averaging down increases your chances of breaking even by lowering the price at which you break even.  That's simple enough, and that's why people advise doing it.

However, it also increases the stakes.  It ups the ante.  If you don't end up breaking even, you are now on the hook for bigger losses because you've pushed more chips to the table.

This is a variation of a Martingale strategy, which offers zero risk-adjusted returns.  In a Martingale, you simply double down on your bet until you win.  If you are betting that a coin flip will come up tails, you double your bet with each heads.  The reasoning for this is that the odds of continued losses are slim.  After all, the odds that a coin flip comes up heads six times in a row are just 1.5%.  By committing to this strategy in advance, you have a 98.5% chance of winning if you're willing to go six flips deep.

However, your potential losses scale in accordance with your increased odds of winning.  On that sixth coin flip, you are now wagering a very large amount in exchange for a small potential gain (presumably a 32:1, or 2\^5, disparity).  There's no risk-adjusted return here.

In a nutshell, averaging down does exactly this.  If it's a great stock and a great buy, sure.  But don't average down because you think it's some free math hack.  You aren't getting risk-adjusted returns simply by doing this.  You're just increasing your odds of winning while simeultaneously increasing your losses if you lose."|0.9|181|0|181

# [Dow futures pop 200 points after back-to-back losing sessions on Wall Street](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/29/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday as Wall Street sought stability after another down day for stocks.
*****
&gt; Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 231 points higher, or 0.7%. S&amp;P 500 futures advanced 0.9%, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 1.1%.
*****
&gt; The moves in futures comes as energy prices eased. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, fell more than 1%. Natural gas futures also dipped.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a second-straight decline, with the Dow losing 184 points Monday. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.67% and the Nasdaq Composite sank 1.02%.
*****
&gt; The market has given back some of its summer gains after recent comments by Federal Reserve officials made clear that the central bank aims to continue its rate hikes, even if they cause economic pain.
*****
&gt; “Investors are coming to terms with the idea that the Fed is serious about curbing inflation, even as recent data suggests inflation is starting to decline,” said Rod von Lipsey, managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management.
*****
&gt; “We believe the market’s summer rally was ephemeral and continue to recommend that investors remain selective and focus on defensive stock sectors like health care and dividend-paying stocks,” von Lipsey added.

t3_x1fjlg|1661855480|stocks|I Tried 4 Paid Services for Stock Selection: Here are The Results for 2021 and 2022|"**ZACKS**

**TLDR**

* They make a ton of recommendations. Many products underperform the market
* Their annual Top 10 list did great in 2021 but not 2022, but you pay for it at $3600 per year. You can get a base subscription for $249/yr for just the stock screeners which is reasonable, though many are baked into Fidelity’s platform for free.
* Their stock screeners are great for finding stocks, especially the VGM and Zacks Rank #1 screener. But to do it right, you need to spend 5hrs a week on it seeing what’s new.

Zacks offers a couple dozen different lines of stock picking services plus a few dozen different stock screens. It’s quite overwhelming actually, but also a bit addictive to pour through them to find some good stocks. I found most of their services don’t outperform the market or have so many stocks in them it would be a full-time job to buy and manage them.

For most of the screeners, the time it takes to vet them and look at each of the 50 plus stocks in each is too much of a time commitment, but looking at the first few in the list gives some ideas of what is working.I started just looking at the recent additions to see if there were secular trends and that helped.

I tried out some of their healthcare picks with mild success: I was going to share the names but the bots on here blocked them because they are under 300M market cap. One was bought out for 40% over purchase price. One went up 6X. Two fizzled down -70%. If you want the names DM me.  


I did OK using the value, growth, and momentum stock screener but I really had to spend a lot of time separating out the good ones and figuring out what was recently added, which they don’t tell you. If you get them too late, the move has already occurred and you will likely see the stock correct quickly.

A few gems I traded from their list around March of 2021 included SEM (health clinics), DAC (container shipping), BERY (financial), and MT (steel). My target was +100% for each and I made that within a year of buying for each. I bought options. HOLX was an exception. I lost -15% on that pick, though it was mostly due to the fact it soared high from COVID revenues and then sold off quickly as the vaccines rolled out. It’s since back to slightly above the purchase price.

**Zacks Top 10 Stocks of 2021 -** their premium offering and associated returns. I did not buy all of these - only SPSC and PWR. But I did track them all in a watchlist.

* **Percent Up Since Rec: 20%**
* **Avg Return of Rec: -8.8%**
* **SPY Return: -10.3% as of time I drafted**

&amp;#x200B;

**2. LEVELFIELDS**

**TLDR**:

* Event-driven alerts work and I like that the success rate is visible on the website
* There are a lot of alerts you can subscribe to, so it’s best to choose one of their lower volume, higher performing strategies to avoid opportunity overload
* It’s good at finding high shorter term returns with high success rates
* For the biggest companies (AAPL, TSLA, etc), my news alerts arrived faster. For those under 100B market cap, it's very helpful.
* Price is 228/yr but their emails of a big update seem to be hinting a hike is coming soon

**Winning Percent: 79%**

**Avg Return/Trade: 23%**

I’ve been using an event-driven research system called LevelFields for about a year now. It was a little rough around the edges in the early days but has gotten much better over time. It’s good at identifying news events early that drive stock prices up and down, often from direct announcements from companies. It shows stock patterns following events, which is cool, especially for the negative events so you can see how far the stock will probably fall. 

They effectively filter the noise out of the news and just focus on a couple dozen event types that really shake stock prices: hedge fund investor moves, layoffs, shorts, FDA approvals, leadership changes, Amazon new product launches, and a couple dozen other types. Unlike the technical pattern alert systems out there I’ve seen, it focuses on real news, which I like, as I feel pattern trading is often a lot like staring at clouds and making shapes out of them in your mind.

For the big companies everyone watches, they don’t beat news alerts. But for the bulk of the companies you’ve never heard of or have forgotten about, it flags a lot of opportunities and companies on the rise.

Most of the time I trade with the information. Sometimes I use it to find stocks for longer term plays. Like Zacks, they put out a lot of opportunities so any analysis here is going to be biased by what I’m choosing to act on. But they publish the success rate and show all past alerts so the past performance is embedded in the platform under each strategy, which is nice.

The winning rates for their strategies range from a high of 90% to a low of 50%, with most in the 70% range. You can alter the outcomes by adjusting the filters for the types of stocks. I don’t like to buy commodities and microcaps generally, as the prices fluctuate too much on factors beyond the company’s control, so I filter those out.

Lately, I’ve been trading on their layoffs scenario, which tracks companies firing people. If you filter for just expensive stocks that are firing people to grow earnings, you can get to 80% accuracy in price prediction. I’ve noticed some events cause the share prices to pop right away, so I often wait for the first selloff before entering the trade.

**Here are the alerts I opted to act on and how they turned out**. I’m noting hold times since it’s not a buy and hold forever system though I supposed you could for some stocks.

10.21.21 - Qualcomm. Return: stock rose +50% in 1 month. Traded options for +300% gain.  
11.11.21 - Northern Gas (NOG). Return: +45%. I held for 5 months.  
12.9.21 - CVS. return: +60% in 1 month (options)  
11.18.21 - BLDR. Return: +67% in 4 days (options)  
12.04.21 Signature Bank SBNY. Return: +16% in 1 month. I then traded a couple more times on it as it was doing well until the Crypto crash. It holds a lot of staked Bitcoin.

12.6.21 Silicon Motion (SIMO). +25% in 2 months. Still like this semi and will buy back. They do memory chips and had been killing it. It was hard to find a cheap semi at one point but this one always traded at a reasonable p/e.

12.9.21 Labcorp (LH): +8% in 1 month but I held it too long and exited down -10% due to covid rates dwindling and testing volumes decreasing

12.15.21 - Broadcom (AVGO). Return: 0% Sold off when war started.   
2.3.22 - Quest (DGX). Return: +50% in 1 month via option trade  
2.15.22 - Upstart (UPST): Return: +30% on options in 1 week. I had owned this stock already and was trading it off and on for about a year..

2.17.22 Blocked by mod bots from showing: +50% in 2 days   
2.24.22 - ALSN (Allison Transmission ). Return: +8% in 1 month  
3.11.22 - Applied Materials (AMAT). Return: +4% in a week.  
3.17.22 - Lockheed Martin (LMT): Return: +70% in 3 weeks (option trade on news Germany was buying planes)

3.17.22 - CMC Steel. Return: +10% in 1 month

3.31.22 - LGVN. Return: +20% in 1 day.   
5.9.22 - TWTR. Return +100% on puts in 1 mo. This was the “Elon will back out” trade a big hedge fund was betting on, so I joined them. A short would’ve worked too.

5.24.22 - Digital Ocean (DOCN): Returns TBD. Up 8% on equity but I’m selling covered calls for an extra 20% annually. I really like this company. It’s like a mini AWS that is more cost effective for small businesses.

6.15.22 - Space company. +50% in two days

6.24.22 - Digital Turbine (APPS). +31% in 2 months. I think this was mostly luck given the timing of the bear market rally.

6.28.22 - Alibaba (BABA). -30% on options in 3 weeks. Can’t seem to get a break on BABA.

7.14.22 - Pinterest (PINS). +30% on hedge fund moves

7.27.22 - Mining company. return: -10% on option puts. Still puzzled why the stock is up.

7.28.22  +4% and holding. They are one of the only medicines for monkeypox.   
8.12.22 - Peloton (PTON). +10% in a day on its layoff news

8.15.22  -3%. It makes solar cells in China and is growing revenues by triple digits. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3. THE FOOL**

I resisted trying out the Fool for years because they wrote so many articles and ads touting their stock picks that I assumed they had to be full of it. But, when I had enough money in the account, I decided to try it out and see if they maybe could save me some time finding stocks early or if they were the cause of certain pump and dumps I was watching.

**TLDR**:

* They pick good, overvalued growth stocks but they don’t try to time the market at all because they want 5 year hold times, which can lead to big drawdowns while you wait
* I would’ve lost a fortune had I taken much of their advice. However, if you have a decade long time horizon and can stomach 75% pullbacks, the stocks they recommend will probably come out ahead
* They repurpose recommendations from different subscription tiers, often using lower tier recs to increase the returns of higher level subscriptions
* They make a lot of recommendations. It’s time consuming to keep up.
* Big range of prices from $100/yr to $5,000/yr and they upsell a lot

They had a lot of subscription options to choose from that range from a hundred bucks or so a year to $5K per year. I signed up for a few of them, including their stock advisor, IPO one, and cloud innovators and small caps service. I should note that the lists they provide overlap enormously, so they clearly repurpose their recommendations and charge you more to get the same recs again and again.

For the cloud services recommendations, I found they generally picked out solid growth companies (DOCN, DOCU, ESTC,etc) but too late, after the stocks were already richly valued. So I traded them instead of buying them. Below are the email recommendations they sent out I saved.

**12/17/21 Buy Recommendations W/Subsequent Performance Since Then**

JFrog (FROG): -17%

**I Tracked Every investment from their Small Caps Playbook List from January 2021. Here are their returns since then.**

* **Percent Winners: 33%**
* **Avg return per rec: -25%**

1. Redacted by mods -88%
2. Redacted by mods: +7%

6. Inspire Medical Systems: +14%
7. Blocked by mods: -34%
8. NCino: -48%
9. Blocked by mods: 0%

I kept emails of other recommendations, though I admit this list is not complete since they only sent emails containing the rec half the time. The rest of the time they send you to their website to watch a 30-minute webinar of their picks in the middle of the work day, which was strange to me and defeated my purpose of saving time digging through stock screeners. I tracked from the next day’s opening price.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. INVESTORS PLACE**

**TLDR:**

* Mostly recommend long-term, long shot stocks
* Best recommendations are free. Most paid recommendations are mediocre at best
* News is wrong sometimes
* They are good at spotting long-term trends in where the new money is flowing to, e.g. thematic investing (online gambling, EVs, rare minerals, etc). I derived value from seeing companies linked to these trends I may not have heard of otherwise.

They make an obscene amount of recommendations across their blog and have many subsidiary newsletter services and promotional picks, so my tracking here is admittedly biased, as I only tracked what I ended up buying. Like Fool, they have a very long investing horizon and may end up being right…years from now. They make recommendations based on thematic trends, e.g. EVs, cybersecurity, etc. However, they also push recommendations based on events or news.

I signed up for Matt McCall’s Investment Opportunities and followed their website recommendations. The newsletter divided up stock recommendations along long-term thematic investing trends like AI, 5G, EVs, online gambling, precious metals, crypto, data analytics, etc).

Their basic principal is long-term investing along big emerging trends. There were about 50 stocks or so in the portfolio at any given time, but since they do long-term investing, many had been in there for years and they offered no advice on how to enter a trade they had entered 4 years ago. So I never did.

Here are the ones they recommended as buys that I actually bought:

**Pct of Recommendations Up: 27%**

**AVG Return**: Not able to calculate this since I didn’t take advice to hold long term for most

EV Maker. Return: -100%

I purchased some call options in this EV company (name blocked by mods) because they made an announcement the company was a shoe-in to get an $8B EV supplier contract with the U.S. Postal Service. They claimed there were no other competitors that made EVs and therefore this would be a game changer for the company. I didn’t do my own due diligence, stupidly. A few weeks later, the award went to Oshkash, a defense contractor most known for making military vehicles. Oshkash[ partnered](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36826291/ford-supplier-usps-postal-truck/) with Ford on the contract to make the EVs. I lost 100% of my call options on this poorly sourced news piece.  


7.15.21. Buy SWBI. Smith and Wesson: -40% since then. I sold it when there was a pop for breakeven returns after a shooting, which triggered an increase in price, sadly.

1.4.21 Buy Chinese Pharma. Return: -48%

The return here has not been good as of late but it was up and I’m holding anyway as this company is the gatekeeper for a lot of large Pharmaceutical companies (Novartis, AstraZeneca, Amgen) to get into the Chinese market. In my view, it was a good recommendation and was largely up until recently.

1.21.21. BUY (Block by mod bots): Return: +100% or 0% Correctly predicted the stock would double. It did, then gave up 100% of its gains. Glad I sold it when it doubled.

1.22.21 Buy ad company (blocked by mods). Return: -76%. My stop loss triggered at -12%.

2.1.21 Blocked by mod bots (rare earth minerals company). Return: +32% This was a good pick. I actually bought on the rec and made about 50% from trading options and selling covered calls. I would not have known about this stock without them. I plan to buy it back at 25. They are one of the few providers of the rare earth minerals in every electronic outside of China.

2.4.21 Buy ACAD - Acadia Pharmaceuticals. Return: -71%. Their report cited 30% revenue growth and a robust pipeline of drugs. Revenue is around 17% growth now. At one point it had doubled in value. I’m still holding. My lesson learned: trade biotechs, don’t hold them.

2.5.21 Buy REDACTED BY MODS. Return: -60%

Straight downhill since the recommendation. Touted as a cutting edge AI/Machine learning data analytics company I bought 100 shares. Revenues are up 50% y/y but I sold it in February 2022 for a -20% loss.

2.10.21 Buy rare earth minerals company. Return: +69%

Another good pick in a sector I knew nothing about prior to their recommendation. I have since sold it but was up +60% when I closed out. I will buy it again at some point when commodity prices have cooled.

Feb 2021 Buy ILMN (Illumina - genetics company). Return since: -49% They pushed this stock hard and it tanked after each[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/ilmn-stock-will-be-unstoppable-once-the-grail-acquisition-gets-approved/), which made me believe it was a pump and dump job. I traded options on this one and cut losses -28%.

2.19.21. Buy (blocked by mod bots) Return: -94% Thankfully stop lossed this one at -7%.

Feb 26 2021 Buy FTCH (Farfetch 2nd hand clothing): Return: -85% I traded options on this one, using their[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/02/farfetch-stock-buy-the-dip-in-ftch/) as the pump I dumped and made 20%.

2.5.21. Buy (Blocked by mod bots). Return: -72%. Still holding. They offer sports gambling online and were growing revenues 75% y/ but it’s slowed to 16% growth.

2.10.21 Buy online gambling co (blocked by mods). Return: -15%. Bought this one as the online gambling is doing well. We shall see.

12.17.21 Buy NIO. Return since: -55%. I traded a few options on it but generally think EVs are overvalued and risky given the huge capital expenditures and exposure to macroeconomic issues. I ended up a few percent as I sold after an initial bump.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

As you all may know, energy costs are soaring for Europeans as a result of poor infrastructure planning and a war in their Eastern backyard. This is layered on top of contractions in Eurozone Manufacturing PMI, accelerating inflation, the Euro / USD getting crushed.

I personally do not see any of these problems easing up between now and the end the year. In fact, I speculate that Putin is going to use these harsh times as a bargaining chip to help Russia in their war against Ukraine.

Therefore, I am short European stocks through calls on the ProShares UltraShort FTSE Europe ETF, ticker $EPV. Because this is a contango ETF, it tends to always trend downwards. However, there are periods of time where it gaps up violently, the last time being the Covid Crash in March 2020. I'm anticipating that it's going to make another gap up this winter as a result of the turmoil in Western Europe.

From a TA perspective, it is consistently making higher highs and higher lows, while approaching an area where it could gap up to around the low $20s, which is my first target. However, I'm swinging for a homerun and I think if chaos ensues, this thing could fly into the mid $50s where it peaked during the Covid Crash or even take out the equal highs at around $75.

I've positioned myself over the last week with January 2023 calls with strikes of $15, $20, and $35. They have been doing pretty well, but I am expecting a pullback in the next week or so where I may load up on some more."|0.65|8|0|8

This isn't a ""decent sale.""

It's the beginning of a fire-sale.

If earnings decline 15% during the coming recession and stocks trade down to 15X, guess what happens to stocks?

\-30%

Lower multiples applied to declining earnings with a higher discount rate.

We're probably looking at...

\-50%

When bubble burst, equities fall 50%.

See: 2000, 2008.

This bubble was bigger - and vaster - than previous bubbles.

""The stock market had its crash.”

No, it didn't!

You're wildly understating the vast scope and breadth of the ""everything bubble.""

Total U.S. Market Cap to GDP was WORSE during this bubble than either 2000 or 2008.

Stocks were MORE EXPENSIVE relative to U.S. economic output than in 2000 or 2008!

The last two times bubbles burst, stocks fell 50%.

We're only down 15%.

How do you all approach this? Where do you look to get an average of analysts price targets? How do you find your own? So many questions...

Even if you didn't believe this was a bear market rally or in technical analysis, a head and shoulders pattern with a neckline break is a rarity, lots of people spot and bet on potentials but here we have the real thing, even if on a short time frame.

Personally, I always thought this was a bear market rally taken to extreme levels of hopium and I'm not sure the bottom is in.

t3_x0qvkz|1661785084|stocks|Leveraging Money Flow: Cyclicals, Computer Software, and Retail|"Let momentum inform strategy to ride the coat tails of ""smart money"".

**Money flow indicates staying power.** That is, when money is flowing into a sector, related stocks will often experiences bounces after pull backs and develop sustained uptrends. And when money is flowing out of a sector, you might see pops get successfully shorted and bearish trends establish themselves.

**How to use this study:**

Day traders can use subsector momentum studies like this one to identify momentum stocks and develop greater conviction in a predicted move.

**The magic sauce:**

I use the Growth 250 list created by Investor's Business Daily (of which I am unaffiliated) to understand the depth and breadth of the market any given week. This is their best estimation of the top 250 growth stocks in the market. I keep a running study of this list, tracking money flows between subsectors.

Keeping an eye on this flow has proven to be a *huge boon* to my edge. I have found that when I trade in subsectors that are seeing changes in money flow that there is an increased level of continuation that correlates to the flow, whether positive or negative. And to put it simply, this translates into bigger moves with reduced chop.

# This Week's Money Flow Report

**TL;DR**

More rotation into other areas of Specialty Chemicals as the entire Chemical Sector flattens out with another industry group breaking out. Even more flow into Oil &amp; Gas and Utilities as commodities see continuation. Meanwhile Computer Software and Retail are looking like a sell.

**Buy Side**

* *Chemicals-Agricultural*
   * Cyclicals continue to lead as growth stocks sell on economic uncertainty. With the war in Ukraine continuing to wreak havoc on the Agri-chemical supply and the market seeking opportunity in essential commodities right, these names broke out last week. They look really extended and not actionable this week as more consolidation is needed. Still worth watching them action for more signals on how the market is reacting.
   * Favorite name in this industry group is: CF with NTR and MOS looking worthy too.
* *Oil &amp; Gas*
   * More of the same here. It will be interesting to watch big cap leaders XOM CVX MRO this week — would love to see them build a handle now. In addition, with any more uncertainty in the strength economy, these stock are could just as easily sell or at best need more consolidation.
   * One I like here from a technical perspective is RRC —  it has yet to really breakout. I also like the relative strength of APA MUR CRK. If I trade these names I may look to close out the position by day’s end to avoid any sensitivity to news catalysts versus trying to swing trade these oil &amp; gas names where they are now.
* *Utilities*
   * As stated last week, these are extended. Still, the inflow continues in these names. Similar to oil &amp; gas, I’d like to see them pull in here and make a handle. Utilities seem to have a head start on this as they were very extended going into last week and closed around the place I’d like to see as support for the handle.
   * AES has yet to break out of its base. NEE looks strong testing handle support to close Friday as well. AMPS is a very aggressive mover to watch — if it breaks out of the handle, could really run.

**Sell Side**

* *Computer Software*
   * With growth companies getting slapped by the Fed last week this is no surprise. Many have insane valuations with some worthy set up for short selling. These are strictly growth companies with high P/E ratios + book values that are going to suffer under tighter monetary policy.
   * Some worth watching include: FTNT DDOG NET SPLK $U OKTA
* *Retail*
   * With most of the big retailers reporting last week, we were able to build more of a picture of how consumers are behaving in today’s economy. Even the most defensive retailers struggled on their reports for many reasons we talked about in an earlier report. There are specific areas of retail to target based on last week’s reports and some additional technical analysis:

1. Wholesale Building Products — FAST FND LOW 2. Discount &amp; Variety — OLLI BIG FIVE 3. Leisure Products — DKS BFV ASO 4. Restaurants — SBUX YUM

# Review: Last Week

**TL;DR**

Last week added up to a very satisfying week to be long commodities, taking profit in solar/alternative energy and going short semiconductors.

**Fossil Fuels**

Last week’s *buy side* focused on coal names to respond to gains from alternative energy as of late. BTU made for a nice trade up nearly 12% for the week but was drug down by Chairman Powell’s comments to a final gain of 6.64% to close the week. Same story with the oil and gas names we identified, although they were also drug down into close Friday with everything else.

**Retail**

Value retail names did not pan out as hoped DLTR earnings report was highly disappointing. That said, we did not trade any of these but did notice that KR had more relative strength versus COST — which confirms an earlier concern that COST is probably a bit overpriced here by fair-value comparison.

**Utilities**

Utilities took a pause here as well. The SPDR Select - Utilities (XLU) did show some relative strength though, down only -1.53% and perhaps building a handle for more upside on a tough week for stocks.

**Semiconductors**

Last week’s sell side took focus on semiconductors with Nvidia’s lowered guidance going into earnings and most of those names looking very extended, that rotation was self-evident last week. Still the market’s response to Chairman Powell’s comments, from this mostly growth-focused area of the market, was SELL. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) finished the week -5.56% making for some powerful down moves.

**Alternative and Solar Energy**

We also looked to rotate out of alternative energy and solar positions as they take a pause. Enphase Energy (ENPH) still looks like it could hold this breakout range down only -3.74% on the week but will need some time to consolidate and produce enough earnings/sales momentum to decompresses the valuation before another leg up is rational.

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Monday as worries over rising rates and tighter monetary policy added fuel to a rout that began in the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 264 points, or about 0.8%. Those for the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 dropped 1% and 1.2%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was suffered a sharp sell-off on Friday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s short and blunt remarks in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, appeared to extinguish hopes of the central bank changing its aggressive course of rate hikes in the months ahead.
*****
&gt; The Dow fell 1,008 points, or just over 3%, for its worst day since May. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, for their worst days since June. The drop erased the August gains for all three averages.
*****
&gt; “Investors again cut back on their recent Risk-On positioning, supporting our view that it is way too soon to call their recent risk appetite a more permanent stance, and now one more likely to have cost them badly,” Rick Bensignor of Bensignor Investment Strategies said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile in Europe over the weekend, European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel warned that central banks must continue to fight inflation — even if it tips economies into recession.
*****
&gt; The coming week brings more Fed speeches, including Vice Chair Lael Brainard on Tuesday, before August’s nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.

t3_x0lvs7|1661770968|stocks|Few businesses have a globally scalable platform like the Trade Desk that benefits from winner take most dynamics.|"Unlike most linear businesses, it does not get weighed down by size. The bigger The Trade Desk (TTD) gets, the stronger its business gets. It has high operating leverage which requires nominal costs to support increasing ad dollars to go over its platform.

Trade Desk’s competitive advantage comes from its economies of scale. In order to be effective, Demand Side Platforms (DSP) must look at all available auctions being run. Looking at each auction costs money even if no bid is made. 

The Trade Desk picks inventory for its advertising customers from over 500 billion digital ad opportunities every single day, which is expected to cost over $300 million in platform operation expenses this year. If another DSP had half as much ad spend as the Trade Desk, to be as effective they would still have to look at all 500 billion ad opportunities, but platform costs per ad dollar would be twice as much. This makes it very difficult for a subscale DSP to be profitable.

Over the next five years, programmatic ad spend is expected to grow at a 15% CAGR, reaching \~$120 billion by 2028. The Trade Desk should continue to take share of programmatic ad spend going forward rising from an expected \~16% share in 2022 to 25% share in 2028. That would provide gross ad spend on The Trade Desk of $30 billion and assuming a 20% take rate provides $6 billion in revenue, growing at a 30% CAGR. Operating margins are likely to be 40%.

Looking further out. $30 billion in ad spend in 2028 is still a drop in the global ad spend bucket. There is a potential future where all digital advertising is allocated programmatically over a single platform and that platform could very well be The Trade Desk, in which case it would be one of the most valuable businesses in the world.

t3_x0jyaz|1661763767|stocks|U.S. stock futures sink following Friday’s Wall Street rout|"U.S. stock-index futures plunged Sunday, after Wall Street sank Friday following hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that the fight against stubborn inflation would continue, and be painful. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00, -0.71% fell more than 250 points, or 0.8%, Sunday night, while S&amp;P 500 futures ES00, -0.83% and Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00, -1.14% dove around 1% each.

Speaking Friday at Jackson Hole, Wyo., Powell said the Fed is committed to taming inflation, which is at 40-year-highs. “While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” he said. He added that the Fed has an “overarching focus right now to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal.” 

Powell also kept the door open for a 75-basis-point interest-rate hike in September, even if the next inflation report is softer than feared. That disappointed Wall Street, which had been holding out hope for a dovish “Fed pivot.”

On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -3.03%  plunged 1,008.38 points, or 3%, to close at 32,283.40, in its largest percentage drop since May 18. The S&amp;P 500  SPX, -3.37%  dropped 141.46 points, or 3.4%, to finish at 4,057.66, in its biggest percentage decline since June 13, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -3.94%  tumbled 497.56 points, or 3.9%, to end at 12,141.71, in its largest percentage drop since June 16.

The Shift Group ($SHYF) is a company that manufacturers chassis for specialty vehicles and assemblies for the commercial vehicle (including last-mile delivery, specialty service and vocation-specific upfit segments) and recreational vehicle industries.  They've been in business since 1975.  They split their business into two reportable segments: Fleet Vehicles and Services (‘‘FVS’’) and Specialty Vehicles (‘‘SV’’), and they own: Utilimaster, Royal Truck Body, DuraMag, Blue Arc, Magnum, Strobes-R-Us, Spartan RV Chassis, and Builtmore Contract Manufacturing.  Commercial vehicles are sold under the Aeromaster®, Velocity, Trademaster®, and Utilivan® product brand names.  The industry sector is cyclical, but they report that their diversification across several sub-sectors reduces the overall risk becuase of the various markets served tend to have different cyclicality.

They've recently introduced Blue Arc, a division that is building is a complete battery-electric, Class 3 truck.  As of this writing and with production planned to start on 2023, they are the only company specifically in the Class 3 EV Chassis environment.   Class 3 vans weigh 10,001 to 14,000 pounds and have additional licensing requirements over Class 2 vehicles.  In general, they are designed to last 15 years or more and meet warehouse dock heights for loading and unloading.

The FVS segment accounts for 66% of the sales, while the SV segement makes up the other 34%.  Over the past five years sales have increased by $587.6 million, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.2%, while income from continuing operations has grown by $52.5 million, a CAGR of 41.4%, and Adjusted EBITDA has grown by $76.4 million, a CAGR of 35.9%.

On February 1, 2020, they completed the sale of their Emergency Response Vehicle (ERV) business.  In September 2020, that deal was finalized with a recognized loss on sale of $3.3m for the year ended December 31, 2020.  The ERV business included operations in Charlotte, Michigan, and operations in Brandon, South Dakota; Snyder and Neligh, Nebraska; and Ephrata, Pennsylvania.  This segment had been a losing proposition for a number of years.

**Specific Risk Factors to the business**:

* **Concentrated customer base/sales**: In 2021, Amazon accounted for 25.1 percent of consolidated sales. Their top 10 customers accounted for 60.6 percent of sales.  I believe they are diversifying their customer base, but as I'm writing this I am struggling to find the numbers to support my memory.

* **Implementing a New Information Technology System**: short-term issue.  Multiple locations are being upgrade to a new system.  It could affect production if something goes catastrophically wrong.  Having been through bad ERP software changes, I think this a low risk to the long-term.

* **Supply Chain Disruption**: This is simply a problem for everyone right now.  If they somehow fall behind as things improve in the future, then this could be a serious issue.

* **Rising Interest Rates and Material Costs**: Aluminum and energy costs are increasing.  At this time analysts are projecting decreased EPS in 2023.  It could be a rough 12-24 months in the market as a result.  This is not really a problem for a long-term investor.  Could be more of an opporuntity if it comes to that.

**Some of the numbers**:

* Market Cap:	873.23M (current)

* PE Ratio:	20.92 (current)

* PS Ratio:	0.88 (current)

* P/FCF:  34.03 (as of 12/2021)

   * Free cash flow in the first two quarters of 2022 have declined, however, this seems to be an annual trend.  I believe they front load some of their annual cash outflows.  I'm still working on this hypothesis.

* Current Ratio:	1.74 (current)

* Quick Ratio:	0.56 (current)

* Debt / Equity:	0.58 (current)

* ROE:	17.60%

* ROA:	9.30%

* ROIC:	17.20%

**Thesis**

This company has very little debt and nearly $1billion in sales backlog.  This is a 100% increase since the prior year with a 46.7% increase in Revenue YoY.  I believe it is well positioned in the inflationary environment we find ourselves in.  I believe they have brand recognition in their sector, and  a first mover advantage in the subset of Class 3 EV vehicles.  They have a tremendous capital allocator in CEO Daryl Adams.  He has laid out a sold plan for this company since coming on board (this is also a weakness to the thesis, if he leaves).


A Value Investors Club write up by a long-time member states, *""Growth in the size of major fleet cariers from 250,000 units in 2020 to 450,000 in 2025.(12% CAGR). The growth is from a 100k retiring/replacement cycle and 200k market growth. This is all per a comissioned 'third party study'. The growth is expected to come from a 7-10% CAGR in parcel delivery volume via growth in e-commerce through 2025. The company estimates that Covid had pulled e-commerce adoption curve forward by 2-3 years.""*  In the past 6 years, Revenue had grown at a 16% CAGR.  This leads me to believe they are positioned to take advantage of this projected growth.  Optimistically, they'll increase their market share.

**Valuation**

I have two simplified valuations that put the current intrinsic value between $32-$40 per share.  Due to my inexperience I apply a \~40% margin of safety, which puts it at a buy between around $20.00 to $24.00 per share.

For example, you buy $1000 of AAPL with your own cash.
Then you borrow $500 on margin and take $500 out of this account as cash. You pay low interest rate on $500(slightly higher than treasury rate)

Then AAPL drops by 60% and your account is now worth $400.

Interest on high beta stocks will be lower than interest on low beta stocks. Since all users are selecting stocks more or less randomly, in total they will approximate SPX.

Most brokers would have issued a margin call, but hybrid loan would provide $400(fully collateralized at low interest) + $100(unsecured at relatively high interest but still much lower than credit cards because broker will be able to buy SPX puts against multiple portfolios at the same time to limit their own risk). With interest calculated daily depending on price of the portfolio.

They can also give an option to combine HELOC into the same portfolio to automate pulling/pushing from it as price changes to decrease interest even more.

And your account will be able to go into negative up to approved limit of your ""personal line of credit"" before getting margin called, or whatever it is called. 

Once you get into negative territory, you have to start mandatory monthly payments to cover interest + some of the principal. Default may lead to margin call.

[European governments are to start mandating the shutdown of certain operations too](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-26/here-s-what-europe-is-doing-to-reduce-energy-consumption-for-winter).

Given that the cost of gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and crude oil is cheaper in the US and will remain so for the long term, what industrial operations (and companies) can we expect to move from Europe to the US? The European economy is full of companies that import raw commodities (agriculture, energy, metals) and export chemicals/vehicles/heavy machinery.

Why will energy prices remain structurally lower in the US?

- The EU is much more likely to institute windfall profit taxes than the US, which will heavily discourage future energy production
- The US has more raw resources (food, energy, etc.) available for use
- Lower regulations/taxes in the US than Europe"|0.91|73|0|73
t3_x02mdo|1661712022|stocks|3M Earplug Lawsuit: What will be the in store for 3M and what can history teach us?|"3M is being sued for manufacture of faulty ear plugs leading to hearing loss amongst veterans. Currently there are approximately 270,000 individuals seeking damages.

So far,16 bellweather cases have gone through trial. In 6 cases, the judge ruled in favor of 3M (no payout). In 10 cases, the judge ruled in favor of the plaintiff (1.1 million to 77 million).

Miller and Zois, the law firm representing some of the veterans, estimate settlement payout between 25,000 and 300,000 dollars. Assuming 25,000 payout per case, that adds up to 6.7 billion. In addition, an unknown portion of those effected may opt out of any settlement, preferring to pursue their individual case especially given the large sums awarded in the bellweather cases.

Now, I want to look at the Roundup lawsuit because this is another case where a product (a herbicide trade-named Roundup) has harmed consumers (causing cancer). The first case was filed in 2015. Bayer, the parent company of Monsanto (producer of Roundup), has paid out over 11 billion dollars since to settle 80% of the approximately 100,000 initial cases. However, with new individuals joining in daily, it was confirmed in a Bayer earnings call that 31,000 suits remain active in 2022.

My take on the 3M situation is that this is not over even if a settlement is reached this year. Those who believe they are entitled to high payout will forge ahead with individual suits. Taken together, the earplug debacle will weigh on 3M stock well into 2023 (they tried to escape punishment by declaring bankruptcy of their earplug subsidiary but it failed). Now enough with the negatives lets look at the positives.

NHL (non Hodgkin's lymphoma) is an aggressive cancer that is fatal in 40% of cases within 10 years. Millions were exposed (essentially unknown maximum number) and Bayer is on the hook every time another exposure turns into NHL. With the 3M situation, we know 300,000 were exposed before the earplugs were pulled. Therefore, 3M does not have this massive tail risk of new cases constantly cropping up.

History seems provide context that 3M will move on from their earplug debacle in 2023 (they are working towards settlement this year and I have no reason to believe otherwise). They are a solid company and at this price is an absolute steal."|0.78|37|0|37

This is bad news for investors. And a significant moment in economics as a whole.

      “The 12 year party is finally over”

The federal reserve will no longer be bailing out wall-street (they where actually subsidizing) interest rates will now normalize to pre 2008 levels.

wallstreet has now become an adversary to the federal reserve.

You see, the federal reserve’s bailouts and low interest rate policies have created a social crisis. 

Asset bubbles, and a rapid rise in stock prices. Have made corporations more powerful. And left a vast majority of all wealth to the 1%. 

There is very little economic mobility in America and income inequality is causing class warfare within the masses. 

Political polarization has become dangerous and very extreme. (On both sides.)

Billionaires are becoming more powerful than governments themselves, and creating their own agendas for how they see the world should function. (Playing god)


                            A NEW ERA.

After Bidens inauguration, he made a bold statement that everyone missed. He said “AMERICAS BACK” and back indeed it is, 
Federal agencies along with the federal reserve have had enough. The government must get back in control. 

There is a new financial revolution going on behind the scenes. Which will make finance more equitable and fair. The federal reserve is in the research and development stage of creating a new type of money. That will allow the government more control over the economy. (Note I will not go into detail due to controversial nature of this topic)
 
Wallstreet is now on its own. Investors in the equities market must rely on fundamentals and companies will have to generate profits and innovate to stay in business and see higher returns on their stock price. 

Cheap credit will also be a thing of the past. Consumers and business will have to be more conservative with credit purchases. And that whole “get rich off debt” will hopefully be a thing of the past. 

The power will be restored back to the citizens of America. Not billionaires, not corporations, not wallstreet firms and institutions. 

REMEMBER! 

The constitution says , “we the people”

It is now down over 90% since its all-time high back at the end of December 2022 and the volatility has been crazy.

The goal of this post is to analyze the company's fundamentals, lay down some assumptions about the future, and value the company as a whole.

Feedback is always welcomed!

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Peloton?**

In a nutshell, it is a company that's making money by offering:

\- Connected fitness products - Exercise equipment (bikes, treads, and soon rowing machines)

\- Subscriptions - Media content related to fitness (pilates, strength training, stretching, yoga, meditation)

\- Fitness apparel (insignificant in terms of revenue at this very moment)

&amp;#x200B;

**The hype**

As we all know, the pandemic caused this company's share price to go through the roof. The demand for their products skyrocketed thanks to the lockdown and the media coverage of their products.

***Connected fitness products***

The revenue of their connected fitness products grew from $734m in 2019 to $1,5b in 2020 (99% growth) to $3,2b in 2021 (115% growth).

*\*Note - Their fiscal year ends 30 June, hence, 2021 is the year starting July 1st, 2020 to June 30th, 2021.*

However, these products are generally considered more premium/luxury. For the same amount of money, one can subscribe to a budget-level gym for roughly 10 years and have access to a lot more equipment.

During this period, the gross margin that they had on these products was around 40%, which is quite high for a company in this industry, but the increased demand did its job well.

Until 2022 started and the growth was nowhere to be found. The revenue declined to $2,2b (-31%) and the decline was over 50% if the last quarter was to be compared year over year.

Not only that, but the gross margin was -11%. No, it is not a typo, they lost money on the sale of these products.

When there's a huge decline in the level of demand, it has a huge impact on the prices (Economics 101). Of course, the tough part was to estimate the level of demand for the coming period with all the uncertainty.

In 2022, the management put a lot of capital into inventory to meet the demand, which wasn't as high as before. So, at the end of 2022 (As of June 30th), there's roughly $1.1b in inventory. That's roughly 50% of all the sales they made in the entire last year. As the prices decline, they had to take impairment for some of these products.

***Subscriptions***

This, in my opinion, is their cash cow segment. It has been growing from $181m in 2019 to $364m in 2020 (101%) to $872m in 2021 (140%) to $1,4b in 2022 (60%).

The gross margin improved from 43% to 68% during the same period.

It seems that the company is more focused on selling connected fitness products as a way to reach out to its target customers and actually make money on the subscriptions.

&amp;#x200B;

**The other operating costs**

If we combine both revenue sources together, the total revenue for the last 12 months was $3,6b with a thin gross margin of 19% (gross margin of close to $700m).

Every young company is known for incurring losses due to heavy spending on Research &amp; Development and Sales &amp; Marketing that would allow them to grow fast. In that respect, Peloton is no different.

In 2022, the spendings were as follows:

1. Sales &amp; Marketing - $1b
2. General &amp; Administrative - $1b
3. Research &amp; Development - $360m

It is quite clear that the gross profit of $700m is not sufficient to cover these main operating expenses. Peloton lost over $1.6b from its operations (-46% operating margin). This is not that surprising as the majority of the high-growth companies are losing money due to the higher than average spending on Sales &amp; Marketing and Research &amp; Development. However, when the growth is no longer there, that's when it becomes ugly. In addition, I was not impressed by the level of R&amp;D spending as Peloton's long-term success is highly dependent on its innovation.

&amp;#x200B;

But that's not all. They had 3 ""one-time expenses"" during the year:

1. Impairments - $562m - Mainly related to goodwill, part as mentioned above to inventories
2. Supplier settlements - $338m - Based on the information available, it relates to the settlement of litigation with iFIT
3. Restructuring - $181m - As the demand falls, the number of employees is reduced

It could be argued that these are one-time expenses (as they were non-existent in the past), however, as the demand is falling and their inventory levels are high, it would not be surprising if there are further impairments, further restructuring, and who knows whether there will be further supplier settlements. If we take all of this into account, the operating loss of the company was -2,7b (-76% operating margin).

&amp;#x200B;

**The balance sheet**

On the balance sheet, apart from the high inventory levels mentioned above, there's around $1.3b in cash. Although on its own is a big number, it doesn't seem so big when we take into account the last year's losses company had. If the margins don't improve dramatically, they will be raising capital during the next 6-12 months.

They already have a debt of $2,4b (for comparison purposes, their market cap is $3,6b) so they're in a tough position.

&amp;#x200B;

**Striking deal with Amazon**

In the last 7 days, there were 2 huge headlines. The first one was the deal that Peloton announced that part of their products will be available for purchase in Amazon US stores.

The share price went up around 20%.

Only a few days later, they shared the 2022 earnings and the share price returned to the same levels.

This is a great example of how short-sighted the market can be at times. The deal with Amazon could be a great way to dispose of a large portion of the inventory that's just sitting there, but Amazon will take its share. That means Peloton's margins are not going to be as high (let's not forget, they're already losing money on their connected fitness products).

The more important question is, is there going to be increased demand for their products, regardless of whether they're being sold through Amazon or direct to the final consumer?

&amp;#x200B;

**The key assumptions about the future &amp; valuation**

If we take a look at the analysts' expectations regarding next year's revenue, it ranges from $2,29b for the entire year (-36% compared to 2022) to $5,82b (+63% compared to 2022). This huge expectations gap shows the uncertainty around the company.

My personal views are that the Amazon deal will help their connected fitness products to not have a significant revenue decline, while the subscription revenue is still growing strong. However, I don't expect their operating margin to improve significantly in the next year.

Hence, my assumptions are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

||2023|2024 to 2027|2028 to 2032|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|\-5% decline|5% growth / year|3% growth / year|
|Operating margin|\-20%|slowly improve to 5%|slowly improve to 15%|

My expectations are that the company has to focus more on cost-cutting and less on significantly growing revenue (other than their subscription revenue)

Discount rate: 8% today, increasing to 8.8% in 10 years

Based on those assumptions, the fair value of the company is close to $1,2b (**$3.48/share)**

The current market cap is $3,58b ($10,61/share)

*Note: I have taken into account the cash, debt, and deferred taxes on their balance sheet as well as the outstanding equity options.*

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on the assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 39% in 10 years and the operating margin will be 15%.

I am aware that my assumptions could be significantly wrong. So, let's take a look at how the value of the company (per share) will change based on different assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue / Op. margin|10%|15%|20%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|24% ($4,4b)|\-$1.9|$2.7|$7.2|
|39% ($5,0)|\-$1.6|$3.5|$8.5|
|192% ($10,5b)|$1.3|$11.3|$21.4|
|300% ($14,3b)|$3.2|$16.7|$30.3|

&amp;#x200B;

This table illustrates well how important it is for Peloton to cut costs and improve margin. In some cases, the fair value of the company is even negative, meaning it's not worth anything! Of course, one can argue that those assumptions are too pessimistic, but there is a chance that it plays out.

Of course, if they manage to grow 300% in the next 10 years (which is the assumption of the most optimistic analyst) and on top they improve the operating margin to 20%, there's 3x upside.

However, that means Peloton will need to bring $14,3b in revenue in 10 years. Just for comparison purposes, the total gym revenue in the US is $32b/year. This is a mature market, so growth is not expected.

Let's not forget that the share price at the peak of the hype was over $160/share. If that seems crazy, it is only because it was crazy! To justify a price of $160/share, Peloton needs to bring in 2x the revenue of all US gyms combined and have a higher operating margin than 25%.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts on Peloton as a company?

I still remember people saying that ""it can't get any higher, it will crash next Monday, Im buying puts"" to just see market showing them big green middle finger.

●Red days after such rally are healthy, so don't act like it's the begging of the big crash. It can crash or go sideways, definitely it will go to the right. That's all we know. Don't rush things and buy puts asap after reading one youtube video or a few comments on Reddit.

●You will compete on the whole different level than just buy/sell shares strategy... If you need advice whether you should buy Apple or Meta, or if you should buy now or during crash, then most probably options are not for you. If you don't believe me, Google why retailers are losing on options.

TLDR at end.  
While  everything looks like doom and gloom out there, there are cyclical  factors at play RIGHT NOW that will continue to  improve the economy by  December:

  
\#1) School is back in session :  there will be an innate  boost in job growth as teachers, TA's and student asst's get back to  college and grade schools.  School back  has built in growth of consumer  staples like school supplies, lunches, books   etc.  The college  economy boosts bars and restaurants as kids eat out and party in college  towns.  And the biggest factor for schools is , FOOTBALL IS BACK,  the  NCAA college football season is one of the biggest boosters of the US  economy on a cyclical basis, stadiums take hundreds of people to run on a  weekly basis in every state, this will also boost jobs and sales of  said stadiums.

\#2)  NFL Football  is back, for the same reasons stated above, the NFL employs a lot of  people and boosts all types of consumer staples  on a cyclical basis.    Beer, meat, campers and related accessories are gonna be boosted at this  time of year.

SO While daddy Jpow  has promised to crash the economy fear not, as job numbers continue to  improve and year end earnings continue to rise  a sense of normalcy will  soon take hold by thanksgiving the FEAR will die after sept. and the  'soft landing' he seeks may be in sight.  I believe this is planned, the  fed knows this is the best time of year for the country and they expect  things to improve through end of year which will allow them to  'tighten' less by Dec.

Inflation  will continue to drop Month Over month as oil stays lower for longer,  the 'current thing' in europe will continue to drag on but seems to  already be 'baked into' the cake at this point.

I understand the influence of QE and the Federal Reserve. I know there are countless variables. All this being said, I believe the market is finally heading down.  Not in a straight line, but it will test March 2020 lows. 

Powell laid out the hawkish stance of the Fed. While many have reason to doubt the future actionability of the words, the messaging was crystal clear. Now that the QT deniers have a hole pricked in their sails, the market should lose its momentum since June.  The question is, what does the horizon look like? Poor earnings, housing market softening (the slumping), natural disasters, nuclear catastrophes, or any unpredictable event. I'm not buying puts. I'm just tossing in my prediction.

What do ya'll think?"|0.38|0|0|0
t3_wz3q61|1661609191|stocks|Which has more debt - Home Depot or Lowes? The answer is not so obvious.|"Hi fellow investors! I thought about the latest HD report and their economic model, then compared their performance with LOW, and what I want to say - the amount of debt these companies have may be frustrating. It’s like analyzing REITs - you feel that something is wrong. In general I use financial stability and liquidity ratios to quickly assess companies.

[https://snowball-analytics.com/public/asset/HD.NYSE#financials](https://snowball-analytics.com/public/asset/HD.NYSE#financials)

First indicator to determine is Liquidity, which based on 3 main ratios:

* Cash Ratio = Cash + Cash Equivalents ÷ Current Liabilities, must be &gt; 0,2
* Quick Ratio = Cash + Cash Equivalents + Short-term Investments + Accounts Receivable ÷ Current Liabilities, must be &gt; 1,0
* Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities, must be &gt; 2,0

&amp;#x200B;

||HD|LOW|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|155 239|95 392|
|Total Liabilities|75 588|55 167|
|Cash ratio|0,045|0,072|
|Quick ratio|0,179|0,095|
|Current ratio|1,18|1,11|

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see both companies are experiencing a huge lack of liquidity. In general these ratios tell us that a company does not have money to pay its current liabilities and can be on the verge of bankruptcy. But HD is TOP 3 holding of SCHD, how can it be? The answer covers in its debt, so we need to look to second ratios of financial stability, which based on:

* Equity Ratio = Total Equity ÷ Total Assets, must be &gt; 0,4
* Debt Ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Assets, must be &lt; 0,6
* Interest coverage ratio = EBIT ÷ Interest Expenses, must be &gt; 1,5
* Debt to EBITDA = Total Debt ÷ EBITDA, less is better

&amp;#x200B;

||HD|LOW|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Equity ratio|0,0031|&lt;0|
|Debt ratio|0,99|1,18|
|Interest coverage|16,5|54,5|
|Debt to EBITDA|1,57|2,11|

&amp;#x200B;

Retail companies have a lot of money in circulation and little in assets, and deliveries with deferred payments increase current accounts payable (their “assets(goods)” recorded in the balance sheet as liabilities). They also have good margins and can use loans effectively without having to freeze their own funds, because their money comes from sales, not assets (many retail spaces are leased).

Well, what conclusions can be drawn on comparison: HD has more debt, compared to LOW in flat numbers, but vice versa in relative comparison.

HD has a fairly conservative debt to EBITDA ratio and its EBIT covers its interest expense 16.5 times over. It grows revenue quicker and greatly uses leverage, has greater net profit margin and ROA.

LOW has cheaper debt (less interest expenses, EBIT covers it 54,5 times), has more liquidity, but debt grows faster than earnings. Debt counts as healthy when it’s cheap and the company can grow faster because of it.

So if you choose between them, what is more attractive? I personally stick with HD."|0.9|323|0|323
t3_wz3exq|1661608382|stocks|Curious about actual impact of rates…|"While there is speculation on interest rates all the time, and speculation about its theoretical effects…

(Aside from residential mortgages), I’ve seen zero talk/articles/complaints from businesses that higher rates are problematic.

Heck, I’ve not even seen anyone complaining about higher credit card APRs either.



So, is it all conditioned theoretical economic rhetoric, or… is there some subset of society that is truly podding their pants at each and e dry additional 0.01% of interest rates?



Perhaps is it that the economy ultimately runs on borrowed money/credit to operate at the speed and volume that it does, and that a zero-credit economy is not mathematically and functionally possible?


Has credit gotten so deeply ingrained in our economic reality that it can’t function without it?

t3_wz1s70|1661603636|stocks|How to gather/search for important information|"Say you wanted to forecast commodity prices, and wanted to analyses the amount of Uranium supply in the next 5 years. 

Obviously there many other factors such as policies, amount of demand, general population consensus towards using nuclear energy. But for the sake of making this simple we’ll assume these factors remain the same for the next 5 years. 

So what are some strategies to gather information regarding the amount of Uranium there will be supplied.

One strategy I thought of was to go through every publicly listed companies in the world and check which ones supply Uranium. Find them, list them, make some basic calculations and determine how much Uranium they will supply. (This will obviously be extreme difficult to accurately calculate)

However what about some private companies out there, there could be many unknown private companies that also supplies Uranium.

So, what are some strategies people use to gather these type of information? I’m sure the really big players/investment banking companies would be able to find these type of information. So how would they go about doing this?

Or rather, it’s basically impossible or extremely difficult to take into every little detail into account, and the big players are estimating as well. 

I guess one more thing is, is my approach too dumb/basic. If it is, what are some other good approaches?"|0.85|12|0|12
t3_wz04jd|1661598211|stocks|$NTR, $CF, $MOS - AG Fertilizer Bull Market 2007/8 vs 2022|"AG Fertilizer is a very high volatile market and not for those that hate risk.  There are no 2 market periods that are exactly the same.  But 2007/08 the Fertilizer market was one of the best performing asset classes before the Oct 2008 crash.  The reason was a food crisis scare and a lot of liquidity in the market.  Sound familiar? The biggest stock tickers here to look at are -

$NTR - Nutrien - $51B Market Cap -  P/E 8.12.  EPS $12.35 - Nutrien is the merger of Agrium and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan in 2017.  Nutrien is a Canadian fertilizer company based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. It is the largest producer of potash and the third largest producer of nitrogen fertilizer in the world.

$CF -  CF Industries - $23B Market Cap -P/E 9.71,  EPS $12.19.  CF Industries  manufactures and sells hydrogen and nitrogen products for energy, fertilizer, emissions abatement in the US, Canada, and UK.  They recently hit ATH's as they closed down all UK production plants as Natural Gas used to make hydrogen and nitrogen fertilizers in the UK is too damn expensive compared to the US &amp; Canada.

$MOS - Mosaic - $21B Market Cap - P/E 7.04, EPS $8.17. Mosaic mines phosphates in Florida, Brazil, and Peru, and sources the natural gas used for its production from Texas and Louisiana. Mosaic mines potash in Saskatchewan, New Mexico, and Brazil. 

$IPI - Intrepid Potash - $714M Market Cap - P/E 2.67(Fwd P/E 7.02) EPS $21.70. Intrepid Potash  has three potash mining and production facilities, one in New Mexico and two in Utah, and generates ""substantially all"" of its potash sales in the U.S. 

There has been a lot of consolidation in this group the last 15 years.  Nutrien merged Agrium and Potash.  CF bought out Terra Nitrogen.  All agriculture fertilizer can only support high prices if the grains market Corn and Wheat futures are high enough that farmers can afford their prices.  So why do farmers use fertilizers?

 A survey of U.S. crop production estimated that average corn yields would decline by 40 percent without nitrogen.  Long-term studies in Oklahoma show a 40 percent wheat yield decline without regular N and P additions. A long-term study in Missouri found that 57 percent of the grain yield was attributable to fertilizer and lime additions,  Similarly, long-term trials from Kansas show that 60 percent of the corn yield was attributable to fertilizer N and P. - Source Mosaic website.  (N - Nitrogen; P-  Phosphorus ).

$MOS hit 2008 ATH of $153.  $CF 2008 ATH was $34. $IPI 2008 ATH was $676.  $NTR was $POT and $AGR and is hard to calculate after the merger. These prices are all adjusted for stock splits and reverse stock splits.  Important note on $IPI - they entered the stock market in 2008 and were definitely overvalued in 2008.  Think SPACS for Tech in 2020/21.  

Corn futures traded in a range of $5.30 - $7.32/bushel in 2008. The last 52 weeks have seen Corn futures trade b/w $4.97-$8.24/bushel.  Fridays closing price for Corn is $6.65 on the Dec 2022 contract.

What did I learn from 2007-8?  I owned $CF, $MOS, and what is now $NTR in 2007-08. We had a crop scare/food crisis due to floods in the Midwest (Illinois/Iowa). The prices of these stocks crashed like everything else in October 2008 and dropped by 70%.  They rebounded like everything else in 2009 but didn't regain 50% of their ATH's until 2011.  

In 2020/21 we have an energy and food crisis way worse than 2007/8 due to the Russian/Ukraine War.  We are also seeing the signs of droughts in certain parts of the USA.  However, we also do not have a financial crisis YET like we had in 2008 which devastated commodity prices.  There is a lot of talk about demand destruction, and commodities could crash if there is no demand.  And they are right.  However Food &amp; Energy is more inelastic for demand than Copper or Gold. 

 I am just a normal blue collar guy with a modest trading portfolio of approx $70k that works in the transportation industry.  I was raised on a farm in the 80s &amp; 90s so I have a very general idea of how agriculture industry worked 20 years ago. I do not give advise and I am fully prepared that I could be wrong and lose 50% of the value in $MOS and $IPI.  I however think the potential upside is a 2x of the current stock prices in the next 52 weeks. 

Disclosure - I own 112 shares of $MOS for a cost basis of $6,800 and 128 shares of $IPI at a cost basis of $6,564.  I took profits and sold out of $MOS at $70 this summer 2022 for a 70% plus gain.  I re-entered $MOS a little too early in June. These 2 stocks represent my 5th and 6th largest holdings. Again I am just a normal guy with a very modest portfolio and you all need to do your own due diligence.  I plan to continue to add to these 2 positions or add either $CF or $NTR at a monthly DCA of $1k/month total.  I am also long Oil stocks.  

Good Luck."|0.82|33|0|33

# **Powell comments fuel 1,000-point market rout Friday as stocks slide for a second week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks plummeted Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in his Jackson Hole speech the central bank won’t back off in its fight against rapid inflation.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,008.38 points, or 3.03%, to 32,283.40, with losses accelerating into the close. The S&amp;P 500 fell 3.37% to 4,057.66, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 3.94% to 12,141.71.
*****
&gt; The major averages declined for a second week. The Dow tumbled 4.2%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost roughly 4% and 4.4%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Powell reiterated a tough stance against inflation, spurring investors to weigh the implications of higher interest rates kept in place for a longer time.
*****
&gt; “Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,” Powell said.
*****
&gt; “We do believe the Fed,” said Zach Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments. “We believe what they say that rates are going to be higher for longer and we’ve seen some repricing of the cuts in 2023. We think there’s more to go on that front and it’s likely to continue to fuel equity volatility from here.”
*****
&gt; The sell-off on Wall Street was broad-based, with just five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 posting gains on Friday.

&gt; # 2022 Slams Stocks and Bonds

&gt; It is no secret that 2022 has not exactly been the year of the 60/40 portfolio. This year has left nothing safe with both stocks and bonds hit hard. Both are in the red by 10%+ on a year to date basis headed into the final week of August. In the charts below, we show the year to date total returns of the S&amp;P 500 (y-axis) and the year to date total returns of various ICE Bank of America bond indices (x-axis) through August for each year going back to their respective inceptions (each index began in 1973 except for high yield which began in 1987). No matter which way you cut it, 2022 has been the worst year of the past half century for stocks and bonds combined.

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 down a little over 12% YTD, aggregate bonds (government and corporate bonds combined) are only around one percentage point better. For the comparable time of the year, the only years that also have seen both bonds and stocks sitting on a loss through August were 1973, 1974, and 1981. The same applies for government bonds. The corporate investment grade bond index has a bit more variety of years with stocks and bonds falling in 1974, 1981, 2008, and 2015. Again though, none of those other years have seen as sharp of a decline as 2022, and the S&amp;P 500's drop in the same time also ranks as one of the worst. 2022 is the only year that the high yield bond index has fallen simultaneously with stocks, however as we noted earlier, it does not have as long of a history as those other categories.

&gt; # Democrats Expected to Keep Senate Control

&gt; President Joe Biden currently has the worst pre-mid-term approval rating since President Truman in 1950. A multitude of factors, including inflation, the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, weakening economic data, age, and a lack of definitive action on campaign promises have all contributed to the President's unpopularity. Although Americans are generally dissatisfied with the President, betting markets still project a nearly two-thirds chance that Democrats retain control of the Senate (chart below from electionbettingodds.com). The only two previous Presidents that saw approval ratings lower than Biden's heading into mid-terms (since the start of WWII), Roosevelt in 1942 (third term) and Truman (first term) in 1946, ended up in the mid-terms losing twelve and five senate seats, respectively. In fact, only five Presidents have seen their party's position in the Senate improve or remain flat since the start of WWII in a mid-term election cycle. In these five cycles, the sitting President averaged an approval rating of 57.2%, which is 19.2 percentage points higher than that of Biden.

&gt; Although only 20% of Presidential terms since the start of WWII have seen their party gain Senate seats during mid-terms, subsequent sessions of congress following these election cycles passed some significant legislation. The 88th Congress (under the Kennedy/Johnson administration) passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, ethnicity, or national origin. In addition, that session of congress banned the discrimination of pay in regards to sex, and the 24th amendment was passed (which banned states from making the right to vote in federal elections conditional). The 92nd Congress (under Nixon) removed the dollar from the gold standard and established Title IX. The 116th Congress under Trump passed the CARES act, which helped the country recover from the pandemic and funded vaccination initiatives.

&gt; Regarding equity market returns, in the five mid-terms where the sitting President's party gained Senate seats in a mid-term election year, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 3.1% between the election date and year-end, posting gains three out of five times.

&gt; The table below summarizes every mid-term election year since the US entered WWII, For each cycle, we show the number of seats gained or lost by the President's party, the S&amp;P 500's YTD performance as well as the YTD change in the 10-year US Treasury yield. In terms of economic data, we also included a look at the y/y change in CPI and the Unemployment Rate (through September), and then finally Gallup's Presidential Approval Rating. Although one might assume that a strong stock market boosts the President's party in the Senate for the mid-terms, the equity market was down on a YTD basis heading into mid-terms in three of the five years highlighted above. However, the average y/y change in CPI was just 2.7% and only above 5% once. For the sake of comparison, y/y headline CPI as of the end of July currently stands at 8.5%. In terms of approval ratings, every other President who saw a gain in Senate seats in a mid-term election year had the approval of a majority of Americans, whereas nearly two-thirds of Americans currently disapprove of the President. Given this backdrop, the possibility of Democrats keeping their effective majority in the Senate would seem unlikely, but with less than three months until Election Day, the betting markets say otherwise.

&gt; # Dividend Breakout Despite Declines

&gt; In last Thursday's Chart of the Day, we highlighted how important dividends are for long-term investment performance. While dividends do help to boost investment returns over the long term, in the short term there is often an ebb and flow of dividend-focused ETFs under and outperforming in terms of price moves. For example, up until June, the S&amp;P 500's highest yielders measured by the SPDR S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Yield ETF (SPYD) had mostly been trading in the green whereas the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) was deep in the red.

&gt; With equities broadly taking a turn lower over the past week, SPYD has held up relatively well when compared to the S&amp;P 500 (SPY). Even though SPYD has not avoided declines (as we also showed in our decile analysis, the highest dividend payers have only slightly better performance than non-dividend payers), the relative strength line of SPYD versus SPY has broken out of the past couple of months' downtrend. That being said, it has not been a sharp move higher like what was observed in the first half of the year, particularly in the second quarter. In other words, the highest yielders are back to outperforming the broader market but not to the same extent as earlier in the year.

&gt; # Two Month Rally Rotation

&gt; Using the Russell 3,000 as a benchmark, US equities peaked exactly a week ago and have traded lower in all but one session since. In all, the Russell 3000 has fallen 4.33% in that time on weak breadth, albeit certain stocks have been hit far harder than others. Breaking the index down into deciles ranked by a variety of factors, performance has generally been the reverse of what we highlighted earlier this month in regards to the rally off of the June 16th low.

&gt; Over the past week, stocks with higher multiples and smaller market caps have fallen the most. Those are also the ones that had become the most elevated above their moving averages after outperforming during the two-month rally from mid-June to mid-August. Conversely, those stocks with more attractive valuations have tended to perform better, although, here too there have been low single-digit percentage declines across deciles. One other interesting point worth noting is how the highest dividend payers have been hit just as hard as other deciles for that category which is a big difference when compared to the spring when the highest dividend payers were the only pocket of positive performance.

&gt; # One Big Clue The Lows For The Year Could Be In

&gt; Are we having fun yet? The rollercoaster ride of 2022 continues, as the furious rally off the June 16 lows has taken a breather, with the S&amp;P 500 Index finding resistance right at its 200-day moving average, a logical place for a break after a big bounce. Worries over a hawkish turn from the Fed at the Jackson Hole Symposium later this week, housing suggesting the economy is falling quicker than expected, the war in Eastern Europe, and stubborn inflation have all been listed as reasons for the recent weakness. But after a 17.4% rally off the lows, maybe it was just time for a break.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Graph-1-082522.png))**

&gt; We aren’t surprised stocks have to take a breather after the bounce since mid-June, but we continue to think that stocks have likely made their low for the year, and higher prices before year-end are quite possible. In fact, we discussed two reasons we feel this way in Two Reasons the Bulls Should Be Smiling.

&gt; Will it be easy? Probably not (It never is). One of the bigger near-term worries is simply the calendar. Historically, August and September are two of the weakest months of the year. Buckle up, as we could see some usual seasonal volatility once again, but the good news is later in the year stocks tend to do well, something we anticipate to play out again.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Graph-2-082522.png))**

&gt; Now for some good news! The S&amp;P 500 made up more than half of the bear market losses, something that indeed should have bulls smiling. As we show below, since 1950, stocks have never gone on to make new lows after this happened. Now, this doesn’t mean they will go straight up from here, but the past 15 bear markets never moved back to new lows once this feat took place. Even more incredible is the S&amp;P 500 was never lower a year later either, up 19.3% on average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Graph-3-082522.png))**

&gt; So there you have it, yet another clue that June 16 was likely the lows, and stocks potentially could be a good deal higher this time next year. The Carson Investment Research team continues to overweight stocks here, anticipating continued strength.

&gt; # Sentiment Slide*

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 pivoting lower in the past week, sentiment has reflected the move as the AAII sentiment survey showed bullish sentiment drop from 33.3% last week down to 27.7%. That marked the first time bullish sentiment fell in three weeks, and it was the largest single-week decline since an eleven percentage point drop the week of June 9th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/082522-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment picked up the bulk of that decline as the reading topped 40% for the first time since the last week of July. At 42.4%, it is at the highest level since July 14th. Although that marks a shift toward more pessimistic sentiment, reversing a trend of improvement from the past few weeks, the current reading on bearish sentiment is well below the highs from throughout the spring and early summer.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/082522-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Nonetheless, after coming within only a few points of a positive reading in the past month, the bull-bear spread took a sharp turn lower as a result of this week's results. The spread fell to -14.7 which is the lowest reading since July 14th. That was also the first double-digit week-over-week drop in the reading since June. Additionally, with a move deeper into negative territory, the spread is a week away from becoming tied for the second-longest streak of negative readings on record.

Imagine how many people bought in this recent run up of \~19%, when we have seen 24% bear market rallies in 2000/2008 recessions. People have no context of these things. Why would a rich person invest in an environment where the gdp is contracting? ISM index is contracting? Why would they take this market to ATHs when the market is up 100% already in past 2 years? There is game theory in markets, if you think other rich people wont buy this , you'll not buy too. Because of this factor alone bear markets and bull markets get so extreme. The fact that people don't get this boggles my mind. On another note, the march run up we had ended at precisely the golden ratio(a psychological level for suckers), so did this latest run up(\~4350). I would suggest you to get out of the markets because they will either go sideways or down. Most likely down, as I mentioned in my previous post more elaborately.

t3_wyjkyg|1661546226|stocks|My thoughts on the unconfirmed report that Amazon will acquire Electronic Arts|"Electronic Art's stock was up 4% today because of an unconfirmed report that Amazon will be acquiring the company. I'm not clear if Amazon will move forward with the bid, but I'm not surprised that Electronic Arts will be acquired sooner rather than later. We already know that Apple, Disney, Amazon, and NBCUniversal have been discussing acquiring the company since May '22. There are also other big tech players like Meta, Google, Nvidia, Netflix, and Nike who are potential suitors given their aspirations for the metaverse, they already missed out on Activision Blizzard after agreeing to be acquired by Microsoft, and there is a low supply of targets with the customer base &amp; intellectual property that EA has to help them reach their metaverse goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Extra background about EA's being potentially acquired:  [Report: EA Looking To Sell Or Merge (kotaku.com.au)](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2022/05/report-ea-looking-to-sell-or-merge/)

Link is a sensitivity analysis of possible valuations for EA: [https://imgur.com/a/3Boxkl0](https://imgur.com/a/3Boxkl0)

&amp;#x200B;

Two key takeaways:

&amp;#x200B;

* According to my analysis, a fair value (*yellow*) would be at least **+$173/share or +30% upside** from today's price. That would be consistent with EA's FY '23 EBITDA guidance for **+$2,400m** and a **20.0x** multiple for a software company that is growing the top-line by high single-digits and +30% EBITDA margins.

&amp;#x200B;

* ATVI was acquired by Microsoft for a **17.5x** multiple. Applying that same multiple to EA's EBITDA guidance (*blue*) would imply **$150/share or +13% upside** from today's price. In my view, that **17.5x** multiple for EA is the **floor** because ATVI merited a lower multiple given internal scandals and declining performance for Call of Duty."|0.74|18|0|18

Sentiment analysis is the quantifying of how positive, negative, or neutral a given text is. I've recently been applying this kind of analysis to various financial subreddits as a source of alternative data in an effort to create a trading algorithm. Finding if a strong correlation exists between sentiment and market movement is the first step. I thought it could be beneficial to everyone share the results here. I've organized the data in this website: [https://sentimentlytics.herokuapp.com/](https://sentimentlytics.herokuapp.com/)

Any sort of discussion is welcome, but I'm specifically interested in these areas of discussion:

* Has anyone else applied sentiment analytics to reddit and tried to find correlation between that and the markets? Were your results similar?
* Is there a better open source model than VADER for this kind of text corpus?
* My background is in Data, so my UI skills are lacking. Let me know what I can improve.
* At the moment I've only included a bunch of the most common stocks/etfs I've seen. Additional recommendations for tickers that might be of interest would be appreciated.

Results TDLR: Long term(3 Months+), correlation between market and sentiment outputs are low. Short term there might be space to use specific search terms as markers for features.

If you want more information in regards to my process here it is: [https://sentimentlytics.herokuapp.com/information](https://sentimentlytics.herokuapp.com/information)

t3_wyakwv|1661523929|stocks|Fed’s Powell, in blunt remarks at Jackson Hole, says bringing down inflation will cause pain to households and businesses|"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell used the spotlight on the central bank’s Jackson Hole retreat to deliver a blunt message that the Fed will keep at the job of bringing inflation down until it is done and that the fight will be costly in terms of jobs and economic growth. “Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth,” Powell said in his speech to the central bankers and economists gathered at the base of the Grand Tetons.

“Moreover, there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” he added. Fed Chairmen often give the opening address to the Fed’s Jackson Hole retreat in late August. While many of the speeches have been consequential for markets, they have also tended to be long and wide-ranging. Powell broke the mold with his speech Friday with a short six-page speech.

In it, Powell drove home the point that the Fed has an “overarching focus right now to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal.” “We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply, and to keep inflation expectations anchored. We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done,” Powell said.

On worries about a possible recession, Powell said that he sees “strong underlying momentum” in the economy. Powell said he was pleased with the lower July inflation readings but quickly added “a single month’s improvement falls far short of what the Committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down.” At the moment, “high inflation has continued to spread through the economy,”

Powell kept the door open for a 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike in September, saying that “another unusually large increase could be appropriate” next month. But he said the debate over whether to hike by 0.75 percentage point for the third straight meeting or slow to a half percentage point increase would depend on the “totality” of the economic data between now and the Fed’s Sept. 20 meeting. At some point, the Fed won’t be able to keep raising by 0.75 percentage point moves, he added. Wall Street had viewed Powell’s last press conference in July as dovish. Analysts said that this view came when Powell described the Fed’s benchmark interest rate setting – in a range of 2.25%-2.5% – as “neutral.” Perhaps in a nod to the markets view, Powell said in his speech Friday that neutral “was not a place to stop or pause” rate hikes.

&amp;#x200B;

Assets could fall another 20% to 25% as the Federal Reserve's drive to tame inflation with tightening hasn't been fully priced in yet, Bridgewater co-Chief Investment Officer Greg Jensen told Bloomberg TV. 

Market conditions still reflect assumptions that inflation will slow dramatically toward the Fed's 2% target in the next 18-24 months amid a stable economy and earnings landscape, he said. 

 But reality will eventually set it, with inflation being more stubborn, the Fed tightening for longer.  

Markets still have significant ground to cover to bring the real economy closer to the financial economy, which could mean a steeper downturn in the future, Jensen said. 

""We're still something like 25% \[to\] 30% above the normal relationship between cash flows and asset prices, which means there's a significant decline to come to kind of align the real economy with the financial economy,"" he said. 

Markets are seemingly in a secular wave of ""de-financialization"" and ""de-globalization"", Jensen added. Meanwhile, labor is growing as a share of the economy, meaning corporate profits will then need to fall as the economy slows.

As the real economy and financial economy converge, prices for stocks and bonds will reflect a big downward trend."|0.79|122|0|122

&gt;  
&gt;\- Planned September IPO gets pre-orders at $60 to $85 billion  
&gt;  
&gt;[Porsche](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/3407753Z:GR)  has lined up investor interest for its initial public offering at a  valuation of as much as $85 billion, signaling one of Europe’s  biggest-ever listings is poised to go ahead despite market headwinds,  according to people familiar with the matter.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Volkswagen AG](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VOW:GR)’s  luxury brand has secured pre-orders that exceed the shares on offer at a  valuation between 60 billion and 85 billion euros ($85 billion), said  the people, who asked not to be identified because discussions are  private. Porsche plans to announce its intention to float in Frankfurt  in the first week of September after supervisory board sign-off, barring  unexpected market shocks, they said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Big-name investors including [T Rowe Price Group Inc. ](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TROW:US)and  Qatar Investment Authority have already indicated interest in  subscribing to the IPO in that valuation range, the people said. Porsche  has also been gauging interest from billionaires including the founder  of energy drink maker Red Bull, Dietrich Mateschitz, as well as [LVMH ](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MC:FP)Chairman Bernard Arnault, the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Spokespeople  for VW and Porsche declined to comment, while representatives for the  potential investors didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  high demand in the so-called shadow order book -- which is built up  ahead of the formal bids collected during the IPO roadshow -- is a good  sign for the listing that market observers hope will re-open Europe’s  nascent IPO market.  
&gt;  
&gt;Many  European and U.S. institutional asset managers that typically invest in  major German IPOs have so far shied away from making firm commitments  due to corporate governance concerns, the people said. Still, Porsche  has enough demand to nearly fill the shadow order book at the top end of  the range and is oversubscribed at the lower end, the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;IPO investors will be sold preferred shares in  Porsche that don’t carry voting rights. The powerful billionaire Porsche  and Piech clan, which controls VW through voting stock, would receive a  special dividend to fund buying a blocking minority stake in Porsche.  
&gt;  
&gt;Capital  market jitters amid Russia’s war against Ukraine and soaring energy  prices and galloping inflation have cast doubts over Europe’s IPO market  in general, which has been anemic year-to-date.  
&gt;

#[Stock futures slip ahead of Fed Chair Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were lower on Friday, dimming hopes that the S&amp;P 500 could grind out another positive week.
*****
&gt; Stock futures dipped Friday as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 87 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures traded 0.4% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped by 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The moves followed an up day for the major averages in which the Dow jumped about 300 points, and the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.4%. The Nasdaq Composite was the outperformer, advancing 1.7% as a pullback in yields helped tech shares.
*****
&gt; “Overall, it remains a really attractive moment to invest in equities. Underlying company performance is strong for the highest quality companies, and multiples are down because of macro fears. That’s the setup every long-term investor looks for,” Robert Cantwell, a portfolio manager at Upholdings, told CNBC.
*****
&gt; Nevertheless, all the major averages are on pace for their second straight down week. The Dow is on track for a 1.2% decline. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are heading to slightly smaller declines of 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.
*****
&gt; All eyes are on Powell’s widely anticipated 10 a.m. ET speech at the central bank’s annual symposium in Wyoming.
*****
&gt; Investors are hoping for new guidance about how the Fed will act this autumn, but expectations are lower, with many expecting Powell to reiterate the Fed’s promise to slow inflation by raising interest rates. Opinion’s divided on whether the Fed will bump rates by half a percentage point or three quarters of a point at its next policy meeting in September.
*****
&gt; The personal consumption expenditures, one of the Fed’s favorite inflation measures, will also be watched ahead of Powell’s speech Friday morning.
*****
&gt; “We’re likely to see a relief tomorrow unless we get a big shock from what Powell says,” Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “One thing I would keep an eye out on if we look to next week and into the fall… implied bond volatility is still very, very high for where it normally is in late August, suggesting that actually we’re likely to continue seeing a lot of action in the yield curve, which could affect stock markets in the fall.”

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I recently started investing/trading, when Tesla stocks dropped below the 700 mark this year. So if I’m not using the correct terminology, please let me know. I’m based in UK.

I wanted to sell when the stock hit 1000 a share, so when the split was announced I decided to leave my stocks in and set my new target to 350. I understood I risked a dip, and was prepared for a longer hold, but also that if more people bought in I could also make money.

However, I’ve logged into AJ Bell YouInvest this morning and my Tesla stock is down 60%?!? Checked Yahoo Finance and the actual stock hasn’t crashed like that. Just my account.

Please can someone explain what’s going on? How has this happened?

I mainly have this question for Broadcom which in 2021 reached 10 years of consecutive dividends, allowing it to be added sometime in the latter half of the year, of which im trying to pinpoint the date.

SpaceX founder Elon Musk and T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said that their companies are working to “end mobile dead zones,” and will launch a new mobile service enabled by Starlink second-generation satellites and T-Mobile bandwidth. Starlink is comprised of a network of satellites that SpaceX has launched into low Earth orbit, and designed to deliver high-speed internet in remote locations across the globe. SpaceX has launched more than 2,700 satellites to support this network. Speaking at SpaceX facility in Boca Chica, Texas on Thursday night, Sievert said T-Mobile will be dedicating a “slice of its mid-band PCS spectrum” to be integrated into Starlink satellites launched next year.

T-Mobile users will be able to use messaging, MMS and certain messaging apps, from remote points across the lower 48 states, Alaska, Puerto Rico and Hawaii and even some remote points in the water. Eventually, the service will work with voice, Sievert said. T-Mobile plans to include the service in its most popular mobile plans but did not disclose specific pricing. Musk said the service will work with Starlink’s second generation satellites, which have very large antennae and will be able to transmit directly to a cell or mobile phone. The service won’t require mobile users to get a new phone. Musk said in or after a natural disaster, even if all the cell towers are taken out, the planned service should work.

Musk specified, “This won’t have the kind of bandwidth a Starlink terminal will have, but this will enable texting, it will enable images and if there aren’t too many people in the cell zone, you can even potentially have a little bit of video.” He added, “We will no longer read about these tragedies that happened where people got lost an if only they could have called for help they’d be ok.” T-Mobile will also offer “reciprocal roaming,” so that visitors to the US from outside the country can use the service if they also partner with SpaceX to enable this service globally. Musk and Sievert invited carriers overseas to join their alliance."|0.94|204|0|204

When I look around individual stocks I see Earnings Per Share, Shares Outstanding, Volume (day/10 day) etc… you all see the same stuff.  

To get to the point I don’t fully understand how to use each of these to gauge if a stock will move up or not.  Volume is easily predictable to show popularity, and if there is going to be a pump and dump… but to me seems useless in determining if the stock will rise steadily.  

I look at Earning Per Share and either see a positive or a negative.  To me I see a negative number as being debt or losses for the quarter/year showing a fundamental problem.  Though I see some people point out debt is normal… but negative to me means more debt than they can earn.  Is this a good indicator that a stock will fail if negative, and will succeed is positive?

I also look at 10 year history along with Max history to see how a stock has played out.  I’m dumb so I watched a youtube video about trends and what looks good and what is dead.  Not sure how accurate this is, but a declining stock over 10 years seems like a good indicator the stock is dead.  Then also the inverse is true.

Bankers in Hong Kong were informed of a possible deal earlier this week, according to people familiar with the matter. American depository receipts linked to shares in [Chinese companies ](https://archive.is/o/D54ae/https://www.ft.com/stream/dd3cc5a2-d14b-4b78-811c-89c387497476)— including Baidu, JD.com and Pinduoduo — started trading higher on Tuesday, suggesting a resolution was in the works.

The [US ](https://archive.is/o/D54ae/https://www.ft.com/world/us)has demanded that Chinese companies and auditors make their financial audits available for inspection every three years by the Public Company Accounting and Oversight Board, a US auditor watchdog, or face a ban from Wall Street listings.

But China does not allow foreign regulators to inspect Chinese company audits, citing a desire to protect state secrets. Earlier this month, five state-owned Chinese companies said they would [voluntarily delist ](https://archive.is/o/D54ae/https://www.ft.com/content/f16853d1-4a9a-4592-9866-a1a683c39e21)from US exchanges before they were ousted in 2024 as a result of the pending ban.

Additional information about the potential deal and the timing of a possible announcement could not be learned, but the PCAOB has said any agreement would include full US access to Chinese auditors. The PCAOB declined to comment on Thursday.

The news was first reported on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal and caught some accounting professionals off guard. But there had been signs earlier this year that the countries were working towards a solution.

In May, a senior official at the US Securities and Exchange Commission [said in a speech(opens a new window)](https://archive.is/o/D54ae/https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/fischer-remarks-international-council-securities-associations-052422) that Chinese companies could seek to safeguard state secrets by exiting the US markets. This was followed by this month’s voluntarily delisting announcement by companies including PetroChina and China Life Insurance Company.

Taken together, these actions suggest the US has offered a way for the Chinese officials to co-operate by taking certain companies with state secrets out of the PCAOB’s purview, said Paul Leder, a former head of the international affairs office at the SEC, which oversees the PCAOB.

“The fact that five companies connected to the Chinese government have taken that step \[to delist\] signals that progress is being made on a deal that would provide the PCAOB access to audit work papers located in China and Hong Kong,” said Leder, now a counsel with Miller &amp; Chevalier. “\[This\] certainly suggests that a deal with the PCAOB is in the works.”

Any agreement would be a first step to gaining access to Chinese audit papers, PCAOB chair Erica Williams has said.

“Our team must be able to go to China and test whether what’s written on paper works in practice,” Williams [said in a July speech(opens a new window)](https://archive.is/o/D54ae/https://pcaobus.org/news-events/news-releases/news-release-detail/pcaob-chair-williams-remarks-on-20th-anniversary-of-sarbanes-oxley-act-and-establishment-of-the-pcaob).

An agreement would hinge on continued co-operation between US and Chinese officials, said Lynn Turner, a former SEC chief accountant.

“Until we see the terms of the deal, it would be difficult to assess whether it will turn out to be a success or not,” he said.

I'm trying to get a handle on when gaming revenues may bottom. Even though, Q2 earnings were anticipated and matched revised estimates, the Q3 revenue guidance of $5.7Bn was way below consensus estimates of $6.7Bn.

A few takeaways from the earnings call.

They guided to 65% gross margins for Q3 - Given the weakness in ASP's for gamin chips - is it achievable?

I was trying to estimate Q3 gaming revenues.

From the earnings call

Analyst ""I guess, based on the guidance commentary, where I’ve come up thinking about would be like a 30-plus percent sequential decline in gaming""

CFO - ""And we do expect, yes, gaming to decrease, not in the dollar amount that it decreased between Q1 and Q2.Our Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2.""

Based on management's revenue estimate of $5.7Bn and the commentary above, I'm getting these estimates for Q3.

All Numbers in Millions.

Data Center - $3,871 - sequential growth of 3%  
Auto -$221 - sequential growth of 5%  
Viz - $500, the same as Q2  
OEM - $130, the same as Q2  
**GAMING - If $5,700 is the total then that leaves only - $1,000 for gaming, which is a sequential drop of 50%.**

Does that make sense?

**Alternatively, a sequential drop of 30% would put gaming at $1,428, then the revenue total goes to $6,100**

Sandbagging? Difficult to tell.

The markets are fairly sanguine about $NVDA's prospects , the stock is up 2% to $177 after falling to $164 in extended trading, I didn't see downward revisions.

I'm keen on picking up some if it declines another 5% from here, but that is looking difficult."|0.9|30|0|30

Intel, Brookfield to invest up to $30 bln in Arizona chip factories

Aug 23 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Canada's Brookfield Asset Management (BAMa.TO) on Tuesday agreed to jointly fund up to $30 billion for the U.S. chipmaker's leading-edge chip factories in Arizona, fueling Intel's ambition to bring more chip production onshore without weighing on its balance sheet.

Brookfield's infrastructure affiliate will invest up to $15 billion for a 49% stake in the expansion project, while Intel will retain majority ownership and operating control of the two chip factories meant to make advanced chips in Chandler, Arizona.

The investment is an expansion of an agreement signed by Intel and Brookfield in February to explore finance options to help fund new Intel manufacturing sites.

The two companies didn't disclose specific terms. David Zinsner, Intel's finance chief, told analysts the interest rate was between 4.4% and 8.5%, which is more expensive than debt financing but cheaper than equity financing.

For private capital providers like Brookfield, foundries represent a cash-flow generating investment opportunity resembling private equity investments in infrastructure, such as data centers and fiber, signaling investors' long-term confidence in semiconductor demand.

Through the deal, Intel could preserve debt capacity for other priorities with financing commitment for a multi-year project, while maintaining operational control.

Zinsner expects this could be the first of many similar financing structures the semiconductor industry explores.

The deal also comes after U.S. President Joe Biden this month signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law, which included provision of $52.7 billion in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production and research.

Zinsner said the arrangement between the companies ""builds on the momentum from the recent passage of the CHIPS Act in the U.S.""

After Pat Gelsinger took over the reins of Intel in early 2021, the company announced multibillion-dollar investments across Europe and in the United States.

They were aimed at increasing Intel's chip production after the industry went through an over two-year long supply crunch that derailed production of cars to computers.

Last month, Intel slashed its annual forecasts due to falling PC demand. read more

Internal memos acknowledge the issue that soon they will have no one to hire by about the 5 year mark in current warehouse locations, due to incredibly high turnover rate / people refusing to do the work.

t3_wxcp2q|1661429843|stocks|Is anyone actually able to articulate the difference between P&amp;L vs ROI...?|"Hello, you lovely lovely people! My brain is possibly not engaging but I'm struggling to get my head around this. I *think* I roughly understand what P&amp;L is and understand what ROI is but when deciding which to use to work out the return, my brain isn't letting me.

I suspect ROI is the best indicator as believe it will allow me to calculate the return. For example, if I start with 100 and receive 120 - would that be 20% ROI? If so, how would you articulate the same figures when referring to P&amp;L? Or even 'average' P&amp;L - whatever that is?

I'll give a real example. Something I'm looking at has the following results over the same time period: 0.51% AVG P/L | 449.51% P/L | 3.24%  ROI - which is the only one that shows how much the return would be on say 100 (and/or which is the best measure of performance?)

Been pulling my hair out over this for hours so really really appreciate it if anyone can spare a few seconds to help out!

t3_wxcgu8|1661429199|stocks|DCA or Lump Sum? How long a DCA horizon?|"Following several mistakes that shrinked my portfolio by 20%, I have decided to sell everything apart from a few positions that I believe are worth the risk (BABA, MVST). 

I am now holding 60k in Cash and I’m already in a 89%/11% allocation of a global developed markets ETF (IWDA) and Emerging Markets ETF (EMIM) for around 14k. I want to throw the remaining 60k in this allocation. On top of that, I have around 2.5k savings per month to add on. 

Research has shown that investing lump sum is a better strategy 75% of the time for an 100% equity portfolio. But when I ask myself “does this feel like we are living somewhere in the top 75percentile of the time with double digit inflation, rising interest rates, ongoing war, threat of another war, insane energy prices”, the answer is no. I might be wrong, but I strongly feel that if anything, we are easily at the bottom 25th percentile of times. 

So, unless someone has a strong case against it, I want to slowly DCA the extra 60k. But how long a time horizon should I set to do so?"|0.43|0|0|0

t3_wx9ims|1661419697|stocks|The latest events in the nuclear / uranium sector - Bullish for uranium and the uranium sector|"Hi everyone,

Yesterday was an eventful day in the nuclear/uranium sector:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Japan restarts of an additional 7 reactors in 2023!

""Japan is planning a dramatic shift back to nuclear power more than a decade on from the Fukushima disaster, **aiming to restart a sweep of idled reactors** and to develop new plants using next-generation  technologies. 

Japan wants **to restart seven more nuclear reactors from next summer onward**,   Kishida said at a government meeting on “green transformation.” That   would bring the number of reactors brought back online after the 2011   Fukushima catastrophe to 17 out of a total 33 operable units.""

 link: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-24/japan-wants-to-restart-more-reactors-to-avoid-power-shortages](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-24/japan-wants-to-restart-more-reactors-to-avoid-power-shortages) 

&amp;#x200B;

 2) Japan resuming the production of nuclear fuel because they are fuel inventories are running low! 

[https://mobile.twitter.com/derekquick1/status/1562286740781481985](https://mobile.twitter.com/derekquick1/status/1562286740781481985)

&amp;#x200B;

3) A day earlier a post on twitter  with parts of the 1H 2022 report of Urenco comfirmed that the  underfeeding is getting in full speed.

From Urenco enrichment company limited:

[https://twitter.com/quakes99/status/1561832740583981056?cxt=HHwWgICq0cim36wrAAAA](https://twitter.com/quakes99/status/1561832740583981056?cxt=HHwWgICq0cim36wrAAAA)

&amp;#x200B;

In 6 months time they already got more orders (11,300) than entire years 2019 (10,600), 2020 (9,000), 2021 (8,700) ...

This confirms the rush on the scarce enrichment services (SWU) and that **overfeeding is happening** soon, if not already.

&amp;#x200B;

4) India plans to produce an additional nuclear power plant.

India’s largest power producer is looking **to develop another massive nuclear project**   just weeks after announcing its entry into the sector, a sign that  Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s expansion into atomic energy is gaining   momentum.

&amp;#x200B;

5) China begins mass production of its Hualong-1 nuclear power units

""Speaking  at the opening ceremony of the 29th International Conference on    Nuclear Engineering (ICONE), Tang said that, as of June this year, China   had 54 nuclear power units in operation, and 23 were under   construction.""

6) Here are a couple uranium stocks:

Take time to do your own DD.

If interested:

a)  Sprott Physical Uranium Trust is an investment in physica uranium without being exposed to the mining risks

Based on the global production cost curve analysis we know that 80 USD/lb  will be needed to get back in equilibrium a couple years later. Today we  are in a significant shortage.

In May Cameco was very clear: ""If the utilities want us to restart our  uranium mines in USA we will need a price of 80 USD/lb and higher""

b) Yellow Cake is also an investment in physica uranium without being exposed to the mining risks

Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what analysts were expecting.

* **Revenue:** $6.7 billion versus $6.7 billion expected
* **Adj. EPS:** $0.51 versus $0.53 expected
* **Data Center:** $3.8 billion versus $3.8 billion expected
* **Gaming:** $2.0 billion versus $2.0 billion expected

Net income for the company fell 72% year-over-year to $656 million. Shares of Nvidia were down more than 2% following the announcement.

Nvidia also announced Q3 revenue projections that fell short of expectations, saying it will bring in $5.9 billion in the quarter. Wall Street was looking for $6.9 billion.

""We are navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment and we will get through this,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.

Nvidia released its preliminary earnings on Aug. 8, warnings investors that the company was going to miss on its own expectations for the quarter as gaming sales continued to plummet.

According to the company's numbers, gaming segment revenue dropped an eye-watering 33% year-over-year and 44% quarter-over-quarter.

t3_wwj6vm|1661346665|stocks|Ripple Effect :: Ford’s job cuts are just the beginning of another EV earthquake|"Electric vehicles have far fewer moving parts in their drive trains than gas-powered vehicles. Fewer parts equate to simpler and faster assembly. EVs do have many thousands of batteries, but these are static and relatively reliable. As a result, car makers can build EVs with fewer workers on the line using more robots and automated processes.

EVs require roughly 40% fewer hours of assembly time than gas-powered cars. Those types of efficiencies must translate into less jobs somewhere in the assembly process, which will ripple outward.

Modular designs + fewer parts = fewer jobs

One thing drivers love about EVs is that they rarely break down and if they do, they are relatively easy to fix. Unfortunately, this threatens jobs at auto dealership and auto repair shops, which collectively employed over 2 million workers in the United States alone in 2022, according the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Oil changes, tune-ups and most other forms of maintenance that dealers charge for will go away.

Aside from the battery replacing the complicated combustion engine, EVs have a different braking system that is longer-lived and less subject to wear and tear. McKinsey estimates a 40% decline in consumer aftermarket spending for EVs compared to ICE cars. This drop will also impact those employed at auto parts, accessories and tire stores, which is roughly 560,000 people in the U.S.

# [Stock futures flat following the S&amp;P 500′s third straight losing day](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/23/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Wednesday as investors await more guidance from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on the central bank’s tightening path.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were all roughly flat.
*****
&gt; Both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 declined for a third straight session Tuesday amid relatively thin trading volumes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished Tuesday little changed. The S&amp;P 500 is about flat on the month after rallying more than 9% in July.
*****
&gt; The three-day Jackson Hole economic symposium starts Thursday with Powell slated to speak Friday morning. Fed watchers expect him to reinforce the central bank’s goal of squashing inflation and keeping expectations about future prices gains in check.
*****
&gt; “Financial markets will remain in choppy waters until Fed Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech on Friday,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “He may struggle to convince markets that he is comfortable with tightening policy and triggering a recession. The economy is clearly slowing but it is still too early for the Fed to signal that they will be less aggressive with tightening policy.”
*****
&gt; Investors will also monitor incoming data to gauge the health of the economy. Durable goods and pending home sales are on deck for Wednesday.

Obviously these are long term ones, im just wondering: with all the (shit) stuff going on in the world, how is VWRL actually able to GROW? It dipped to around 90/93 beginning the War in Ukraine, to now being 104+....I just do not understand how that is possible, there are not that much military stocks and I would've thought Facebook(META) and the likes wouldn't be doing THAT good.

so a 2 parter:

\- Is there a place where I can find ''tldr'' news about a stock without actually needing to invest countless hours reading massive statistics?

\- Is this a time to buy or sell?

&amp;#x200B;

Normally I'd know the answer to the 2nd Q, but due to the volatile market im thinking of selling them and buying them back later. This would mean I have a 300/400 euro profit whcih would make me able to buy 3/4 more stocks by the time I buy them back. I have a (stupid because i did no research so call it a gut feeling) feeling it will dip a little more back to 100 or so, any thoughts or maybe past experiences that could steer me away or help me make a little more educated decision :)?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;DR; Im a noob just trying to slowly gather VWRL and play a little with them here n there. But this might not be the right stock/time/move, asking advice :)

t3_ww8aip|1661310642|stocks|Back to UCaaS stock discussions (RingCentral)|"Now it hasn't been too long since my last analysis, but I'm trying to make sense of the situation on this stock. No new news, yet it's down like 20% from a week ago. I don't see any other stocks with 0 news down 20% that have shown strong earnings and forward guidance. 

This stock was dragged down with Avaya, and when Avaya went up, this stock got dragged down even harder. Now it's probably relating itself to Zoom which had a bad forecast, but ZM numbers are coming down, so it makes sense for their stock to continue to trend downward till their guidance gets more accurate.

So it begs the question, why. is this stock in particular getting driven lower when fundamentally it still hasn't changed. Looking at the 5 year chart, if you held this stock it would have only netted you 10% gain. That doesn't seen to make a lot of sense, based on their trajectory of REV. Video conferencing and telephone services aren't going anywhere, and it won't be the first service cut from your martech stack.

t3_ww2s3f|1661295460|stocks|Intuitive Surgical Inc., My Thoughts on ISRG|"I have no financial stake in this stock.

ISRG may not be something on your radar. They are the pioneers of the field of robotic surgery. In my mind, the long term success of ISRG rests on their technology.

What is robotic surgery? A laparoscopic surgery is performed by a robot which is remotely controlled by a surgeon sitting at a computer (simplification). There are many applications in fields of GYN, urology, general surgery and thoracic surgery.

Is robotic surgery better than standard surgery?

To me, better can mean two things. 1. better patient outcomes. 2. you can get the best surgeon for the job and not just the locally available guy who may or may not be competent.

On the first topic, the literature is not too encouraging. A multitude of small sample size studies exist in the GYN, urology and general surgery literature. In some select cases, robotic surgery has been found to be meaningfully superior IE better longterm outcomes. In most cases, standard laparoscopic surgery and robotic surgery are equivalent in which case why do robotic surgery which is massively more expensive and takes longer.  Larger studies are needed and will be performed in the future.

On the second topic, many chips have to fall correctly for this to be a reality.

 1. in order for a layperson to make an educated choice they will need access to data on quality (NSQIP) which they currently do not have.

2. if the surgeon is not in the same room as the patient, there needs to be backup immediately available in case you have to convert to open. The local surgeon will also be tasked with putting in all the trocars, insufflate the patient, close, etc. Not sure how you can get any surgeon to sign up to basically be a somebody else's intern.

3. primary surgeon not in the same room as the patient has to become accepted and not just a novelty.

ISRG is can be a trendy stock. Many in the medical field own their shares. Personally, the technology has too many open questions for me to invest in it."|0.88|12|0|12

They sold (arguably) their best 2 businesses (Lottery and Sports Betting) to pay down debt because interest was like 20% of their REVENUES! And they had to accelerate the sale of Sports Betting so they basically lost $400mm between when they announced the sale and executed it. Well, now their margins will be better even though everything else stinks.

About half of the company’s revenue comes from selling gaming cabinets to Casinos in the US, UK, and Europe, with about 30% of these sales from abroad. Yes, their business is levered to fucking septuagenarians being able to ride the bus to Atlantic City with pocket change. This segment struggled during the pandemic and remains below 2019 levels The company is selling 30% fewer cabinets than 2019 and 50% fewer new/expansion units, relying on replacement units to generate sales. This might signify apprehension on the part of operators to purchase new cabinetry or that LNW is unable to convert new business. 

Publicly traded SciPlay (NYSE: SCPL), of which LNW owns 80%, focuses on mobile gaming which is less capital intensive for a related market opportunity. LNW attempted to purchase the remaining shares of SCPL earlier this year but dropped the bid. A public letter written by Engine Capital (owns 7% of SCPL) suggests that LNW was attempting to sell its own mobile gaming intellectual property to SCPL at inflated price to fair value. LNW made some acquisitions in the mobile gaming space last year, and my guess is they don’t know where to put them, and it is worthless to SCPL because they have evergreen tentpole franchises that they own and monetize well already. Ain't nobody got time for \*checks notes\* *Mystic Orbs*? Fucking *Bompers?* Nobody plays or cares about these games.

The company has used 30% of a $750mm share repurchase authorization to buy back 4% of their market cap in 5 months. Because... why the hell not, why not authorize repurchase of 12% of your stock after selling your businesses because you have no better ideas. Company usually trades 25-40x P/E and expects to make $7.5/shr in 2022, before they pay that exact same amount in taxes on proceeds of the asset sales they had to do to survive. So 2022 EPS after taxes is a goose egg ZERO, and BTW the analyst consensus is for EPS of $2.5 in 2023. It's probably worth $65 or $70 in 2024. Fuck this company.

I think SCPL is more interesting and it's more consistently profitable than the other business units, even though it is growing a bit slower after the Covid effect that has waylaid all the stay at home companies. Anyone passionate about this one?"|1.0|4|0|4
t3_wvun62|1661275506|stocks|S&amp;P500 TA shows a potential 15-17.7% leg down.|"*To be totally transparent, I was planning on posting this idea on the 5th of August when I sold all my positions out of the US market, but back then, everyone was so bullish I just didn't want to be downvoted into oblivion. (If you want to see the proof of my sales, I'll answer in the comments)*

[Daily S&amp;P500 from covid lows](https://ibb.co/GWggtwK)

In this first graph, you can see the full bull run since the covid lows, with the latest pull-back forming two consecutive lower lows with their corresponding lower highs. The latest local high was just formed last week and looking at the RSI, it has formed the second consecutive hidden bearish divergence. 

Taking Fibonacci, we can also see that we haven't yet reached the 0.5 line. This is my minimum target for the bear market, which hopefully will be reached by Nov-Dec when Europe will be most miserable with the lack of Russian gas. By this time, temperatures will be close to 0ºC, and they will start realising how dependent they are, and pessimism will be at a peak. 

[Closer look and H&amp;S](https://ibb.co/FDQz8JV)

Personally, I believe Fibonacci's suck, so I would never trust them as a sole indicator. What makes me like the 0.5 line this time is that it matches *perfectly* with the objective of the head and shoulders shown in the previous graph. 

As well, an extra 2.7% retracement would take us to the values pre-covid crash. Where it all started. The moment we were supposed to have a global recession and that we avoided thanks to printing cash and stimuli. If economics are cycles, what better than returning to where it all started? We will definitely find demand at those values, so my lowest point for the bear market would be here, at 3400 points.

Some people will come here to say *""Everyone is expecting this, that's why it won't go lower"", ""Everyone is fearful, it's time to buy""* or any Burren Waffett quote. I would ask them, have we really suffered any pain? How many friends have lost their jobs? How many people can't afford their mortgage and have lost their house? How many people do you see looking into the trash looking for food? How many people have you seen committing suicide? This is not even 10% of a crisis, not even 5% of 2008.

t3_wvr7ae|1661267156|stocks|U.S. economy slows again, S&amp;P finds, due to high inflation and rising interest rates|"U.S. businesses grew more slowly in August as high inflation and rising interest rates spurred customers to curb spending, a pair of surveys showed on Tuesday. The S&amp;P Global U.S. services sector index dropped to 44.1 from 47.3, based on “flash” survey. It was the fifth decline in a row and weakest reading since May 2020, shortly after the U.S. outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. manufacturing sector index, meanwhile, slipped to 51.3 from 52.2 and registered the lowest reading in just over two years. Readings above 50 signifies expansion; below that, contraction.

A pair of similar surveys by the Institute for Supply Management, however, show the economy is somewhat stronger than the S&amp;P indexes indicate. The ISM surveys have been around a lot longer and arguably have a better track record. 

**Big picture:** There’s no doubt about it though: The U.S. economy has slowed due to rising interest rates as the Federal Reserve tries to stamp out high inflation, but the economy is still growing. The big question is, how much will the economy slow and will it slip into recession? Many economists think a recession is likely by year end or in 2023 if the Fed keeps raising interest rates. Higher rates slow the economy by raising the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses, making it harder to buy a house or car or take out a loan. 

**Key details:** Both manufacturers and service-oriented companies such as retailers reported waning sales in August and the lowest demand in more than two years. They’ve scaled back hiring efforts in response. In a bit of good news, the cost of supplies eased for the third month in a row. That’s a sign inflation pressures are relaxing after a big runup earlier in the year. Rising wages, on the other hand, have partly offset the decelerating rise in the cost of supplies.

In any event, with their own costs leveling off, businesses raised the prices they charge customers at the slowest pace in 18 months. They also holding the line on prices to entice customers to spend more. If inflation continues to ease, the Fed might not have to raise interest rates so high that the economy tips into recession. Looking ahead: “Gathering clouds spread across the private sector as services new orders returned to contractionary territory, mirroring the subdued demand conditions seen at their manufacturing counterparts,” said Sian Jones, senior economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. “The historical data for the services index only go back to late 2009, so we would be wary of attaching too much importance to this reading, particularly at a time when the ISM services index, which started in 1997, was at a relatively strong 56.7 in July,” said U.S. economist Paul Ashworth of capital Economics.

I recently learned about a new company called EARGO: a medical device company engaged in enhancing the quality of life of people with hearing loss in the United States.

It looks FDA recently enabled EARGO aids to be purchased without a prescription. I read that this will go in effect around October. I think this could be quite a game changer and so I am definitely interesting in purchasing some stock. 

I was just wondering if you guys have any perspective on how long it takes for a company to go from having FDA approval to a full sale mode. I am asking because I am not sure if I should jump in and buy the shares now or wait out until they have figured out the kinks.

 Aug 23 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc [**(TWTR.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/TWTR.N) misled federal regulators about its defenses against hackers and spam accounts, CNN and the Washington Post reported on Tuesday, citing whistleblower disclosures by the social media company's former security chief Peiter Zatko.

In an 84-page complaint, Zatko, a famed hacker more widely known as ""Mudge"", alleged Twitter falsely claimed it had a solid security plan and said he had warned colleagues that half the company's servers were running out-of-date and vulnerable software, according to the reports.

 The whistleblower filing comes as the social media company is embroiled in a legal battle with Tesla Inc [**(TSLA.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk after the world's richest person said in July he was ending an agreement to buy the company in a $44 billion deal alleging it had violated the deal contract.

* The company also declared a 3-for-1 stock split and expanded its stock repurchase program by $915 million, increasing the total current authorization to $1 billion. The stock will begin trading on a post-split basis on Sept. 14.

* For its fiscal fourth quarter, ended July 31, Palo Alto posted revenue of $1.6 billion, up 27% from the year-ago quarter, and ahead of the company’s guidance range of $1.53 billion to $1.56 billion. Non-GAAP profits were $2.39 a share, likewise above the forecast range of $2.26 to $2.29 a share. 

* Billings were up 44%, to $2.7 billion. Remaining performance obligations were up 40% to $8.2 billion. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the company earned $3.3 million, or 3 cents a share.

We don't talk much about PANW here, so was hoping to get some discussion going:

* If you work in tech or in the cybersecurity industry, what is your take on their future?
* Who are their major competitors and is PANW ""best in class""?
* Does the split make it more likely for you to keep track of this stock?

# [Stock futures inch higher after major averages suffer worst day since June](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/22/stock-futures-inch-higher-after-major-averages-notch-worst-day-since-june.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures inched higher Tuesday as the market tried to recover from its worst day since June.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 40 points, or 0.1%, while S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also gained 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Palo Alto Networks surged in the premarket on the back of strong quarterly results, while Zoom Video shares slumped after the video conferencing company lowered its full-year forecast.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a downbeat session, as a summer rally continued to fade amid mounting rate hike concerns.
*****
&gt; The Dow dropped more than 600 points Monday, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell more than 2% each. Those were the biggest one-day drops for the Dow and S&amp;P 500 since June 16. The Nasdaq suffered its worst session since June 28.
*****
&gt; Monday’s sell-off was broad-based, with all 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closing lower, led by declines in information technology and consumer discretionary stocks. A slide in tech stocks weighed down the tech-heavy Nasdaq.
*****
&gt; “The global growth story is in shambles right now,” said Ed Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda. “That’s what’s really kind of weighing on risk appetite right now because you can’t have the U.S. continue to be attractive while the rest of the world is crumbling.”
*****
&gt; This sentiment will continue to put pressure on big tech and consumer discretionary stocks, he said. Moya, echoing other investors, expects another round of hawkish pushback from Fed chair Jerome Powell when he speaks Friday at the central bank’s annual Jackson Hole economic symposium.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues Tuesday with results from Macy’s, Nordstrom and Dick’s Sporting Goods. July new home sales will also be reported, along with August manufacturing PMI and the August Richmond Fed survey.

Here are 5 reasons to buy Teradyne $TER at $94.

**Duopoly**

The semi test equipment industry is largely a duopoly, controlled by $TER and its largest competitor Advantest. Barriers to entry are high and projects have long gestation periods

**High Growth**

The semi conductor industry has been growing at double digits and is expected to grow in the high single digits over the next decade, ensuring $TER a fairly sustainable and steady source of revenue.

**Very Profitable**

$TER earns an operating profit of about 30% of revenues, which are among the best in the industry and protect it from downturns like the current one.

**The Robotics Division is growing fast at 35% a year.** 

Still a small segment of total revenues, this division should boost revenues and earnings over the next 10 Years.

**The Stock is at an absolute bargain**

$TER fell massively from a high of $169 in Dec 2021, after its largest client revealed that it would push out the launch of 3nm chips to 2022-2023. For 2022, earnings should drop 36% and revenues 17%. However, $TER expects to double earnings to about $8 a share from the current $4 by 2024, which gives it a **2 Year Forward PE of only 11.7**. At an earnings of $8, the stock should be worth 20X, or $160 two years out --- **70% higher than today’s price of $94.**

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

**Who are Farfetch and what do they do?**

Farfetch is a British-Portuguese company founded ion 2007. They distribute luxury fashion products from more than 1400+ Luxury boutiques around the world. They currently operate in more than 170 countries and territories.(2)


**Why Invest In Farfetch**

Farfetch are the biggest luxury fashion distributor in the world. They currently employ 6464 people and is expanding year over year. They finished a deal with industry leader Neiman Marcus to obtain minority ownership and enter a strategic partnership with them. The deal is valued at $200Million. (4)


**Financials**

Farfetch has been growing at a rapid rate since 2018. This is mainly helped by the pandemic in 2020. As in person shopping had became much more of an inconvenience, people looked to purchasing their luxury fashion products online.

Farfetch’s revenue has grown from $602Million USD (year ending 2018) to $2.26B (year ending 2021). The company currently shows no sign of slowing as they actively push to obtain more users. (1)

The EBIDTA margins for Farfetch was 0.1% for 2021. This is expected to grow to 1-2% for 2022, indicating positive growth potential and increased profitability. (2)(5)

**Expert Analysis**


Farfetch’s analysts believes the company to be undervalued with median price targets reaching $16 per share. (3)


**Stock Price**

Farfetch had recently hit a 52 week low at $6.52. 


**Prospectus**

As the technology industry grows, Farfetch is able to draw in more customers. Farfetch creates a convenient place for luxury fashion brands and shoppers to buy and sell their products. With social media stars on such platforms like TikTok, Instagram and YouTube becoming more popular than ever, this draws in more incentives to buy luxury products as fans of these social media stars may purchase the clothes that these stars are wearing.


Conclusion:

With great financials and positive prospectus. I believe Farfetch is a great stock to buy in 2022.

Ford sent an internal email Monday to employees, saying it would begin notifying affected salaried and agency workers this week of the cuts. The email was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The workforce reduction mostly targets employees in the U.S., Canada and India. About 2,000 of the targeted cuts will be salaried jobs at the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker. The remaining 1,000 employees are working in contract positions with outside agencies, the company said.

The cuts weren’t unexpected. The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported in July that layoffs were coming for white-collar staff as part of a broader restructuring to sharpen the car company’s focus on electric vehicles and the batteries that power them.

t3_wuu3xt|1661176009|stocks|$TWLO - An obvious buy at these levels|"I don't particularly like ""DD"" posts, but I want to make a public record of this call.

TWLO is highly unprofitable growth tech company which reached a silly valuation during the height of the COVID pandemic. The stock has been falling for the last 18 months and is the epitome of the kind stock you absolutely would not want to own right now, which is exactly why this might be the time to buy.

TWLO is an industry leading cloud communications platform. Their services are used by some big players such as AirBnB, Stripe, Lfyt, Coca Cola, Deliveroo, Salesforce, Twitter, and many more.

They've been growing in the high double digits for years posting 40% YoY growth in the last year alone with a 123% dollar-based net expansion rate. This year they're targeting 30% YoY growth and have stated that they're committed to non-GAAP profitability by the end of 2023.

TWLO currently has a market cap of around $14b, and an enterprise value of around $10.5b. At \~3x EV / Sales this is the lowest valuation TWLO has ever traded at - so what's the catch?

As mentioned, TWLO is deeply unprofitable and has been demonstrating negative operating leverage in recent years - the more TWLO grows the more TWLO loses. On a non-GAAP basis the company is losing around $60 million a year, and on a GAAP basis this jumps to an eye-watering $1.2b.

Despite this, the reason I think TWLO is a buy here is because it's they have about $3b in cash and are at no risk near-term risk of insolvency. Additionally, most of their loses are non-cash expenses such as stock-based comp which make their loses look more frightening than they actually are. TWLO also has a fairly good track record at guiding conservatively so I feel confident that they will make good progress towards their promise of non-GAAP profitability in 2023 and with a valuation of just x3 EV / sales just a small operating profit would be all that's required for the company to trade at a reasonable multiple and for the market to reward them with a more favourable valuation.

On top of this TWLO is an an obvious acquisition target at this valuation which I suspect will provide some support for stock near-term. Over the last few years TWLO has spent around $6b to acquire Sendgrid,  Segment and  Zipwhip. With the company now trading at $10.5b in enterprise value any potential acquirer of TWLO would now be able to get all of these companies plus TWLO for an additional $4.5b. With many large tech companies relying on the services TWLO provides, and companies like Salesforce having many synergies should they seek to acquire TWLO, I believe the negative operating leverage of TWLO wouldn't be too much of a concern to any potential acquirer.

If TWLO can achieve non-GAAP profitability in 2023, I believe TWLO would be then be rerated by the market and trade nearer to it's longer-term P/S multiple, perhaps resulting in a 50-100% rally over the span of a few weeks. On the other hand if TWLO continues to burn cash they'll almost certainly be able to sell for at least $10-15b which should put a floor on further loses.

This is obviously a highly speculative play largely based on the assumption that TWLO is worth at least $10b to someone. If I were to guess near-term the stock will continue trend down from these levels, but at some point over the next 12 months I expect a major catalyst to send the stock significantly higher.

Obviously no one should open a position in TWLO based on this post alone. This is just a summary of my thesis. There are lot of good reasons not to touch this stock."|0.76|57|0|57

China's gradual opening of its bond market has helped elevate the yuan's status globally, but the currency is about to face a big test.

Over the last two decades, China has gradually allowed more traders and central banks to buy into its yuan-denominated bond market, according to an August [paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30336/w30336.pdf) published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Beijing staggered the entry of stable investors into its debt with a series of policy moves that included varying quotas, lock-up periods, and registration requirements. Now, Chinese bonds are viewed more favorably, are starting to be treated more like debt from more advanced economies, the economists wrote.

""We find that China's reputation is in between emerging markets and developed countries and has drifted upwards in recent years,"" they said."|0.92|507|0|507

# [Dow futures drop 300 points to start the week as Wall Street rally continues to fizzle](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/21/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Monday following a halt in the summer rally last week, as fears of aggressive interest rate hikes returned to Wall Street.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 321 points, or by 0.95%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 1.22% and 1.57%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Those moves come as European markets experienced steep declines, driven in part by worries of rising inflation and higher interest rates around the world.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 closed down 1.29%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 292 points, or 0.86%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.01%. The major averages also posted weekly losses.
*****
&gt; Investors are anticipating what could be a volatile week of trading ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s latest comments on inflation at the central bank’s annual Jackson Hole economic symposium.
*****
&gt; “Fed Chair Powell is likely to sound meaningfully more hawkish during his Jackson Hole speech on Friday morning at 10am ET than he did at his July 27th press conference, when he said the fed funds rate is already back to neutral,” according to a Monday report from Wolfe Research’s Chris Senyek.
*****
&gt; On the earnings front, traders are expecting Palo Alto Networks and Zoom Video to report results Monday after the bell.

I’ve been periodically increasing a position in SMH over the last year backed by the belief that semiconductors will be the backbone of the future.

Reading up Buffet’s increased stake in OXY, I began to wonder if Energy might be the better play for the long-term. Something like IYE. Of course, oil is likely on its way out at some point, but perhaps players in this industry shift to green energy instead.

Take palantir. It’s a popular stock. They make software, they sell it to the government, and now business, cool. How can I tell or learn from people that have firsthand knowledge of what they offer? 

Like I want to know what the people who buy these products think? Any software company on enterprise level applies, it’s not specially palantir.

Sure… if it was guaranteed, then someone would be a billionaire hedge fund owner.  I get all that. Nothing is guaranteed.  

But if you’re reasonably comfortable watching and taking some risk on certain trades, is this a decent consistent strategy?  

Rationale - only need to track a few funds.  Ones like TQQQ, for example. So not stock picking, not caught in intricacies of what’s happening with specific funds.  So no plays like BBBY, GME, etc.  just bigger macro trends. 

Take TQQQ for example. On Friday the NASDAQ dropped 2%, and TQQQ dropped &gt;5%.  If Q is a bit oversold, and traces a bit upwards (even if in a long term downtrend), then TQQQ traces up 3x as much roughly.  As a trade over a day or two, it’s likely that there will be some chance for pocketing some profits.  Maybe not a ton?  But something.

Here's my ***objective*** ***view supported by data, research &amp; facts*** of how each publisher did in the prior quarter &amp; the outlook ahead:

&amp;#x200B;

**Prior edition:**  

*  [Q1 '22 Earnings Call Takeaways for video game publishers: (ATVI, EA, TTWO) : stocks (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uzeoht/q1_22_earnings_call_takeaways_for_video_game/) 

&amp;#x200B;

**CY Q2 '22 Bookings vs the prior quarter:**

* ATVI: $1,637m (*down $284m or 14.8%*)
   * Bookings were down primarily due to Activision (-*$299m or -37.9%)* 
   * Decrease is primarily due to Call of Duty

&amp;#x200B;

* EA: $1,299m (*down $37m or 2.8%*)
   * That includes Full Game sales (*down $117m or 41.5%; this is primarily due to last year including releases for Mass Effect Remaster and It Takes Two without a comparable release during the current quarter*)
   * Live Services (*up $80m or 7.6%; primarily due to Apex Legends, acquisitions, and FIFA*)

&amp;#x200B;

* TTWO: $1,103m (*up $391m or 49.1%*)
   * The increase is primarily due to the recent Zynga acquisition, NBA, and WWE
   * Excluding Zynga, TTWO's bookings would have been $731m or up 3% y/y

&amp;#x200B;

* General Takeaways:
   * ATVI continues to struggle due to lower engagement with Call of Duty
   * EA &amp; TTWO results were within expectations 

&amp;#x200B;

**Full Year Bookings Guidance vs prior guidance:**

* ATVI: N/A
   * No guidance available since they're about to be acquired by Microsoft

&amp;#x200B;

* EA: $7,900m - $8,100m (*no change*)
   * No change in prior guidance since EA Sports outperforming will offset headwinds from a weaker mobile market and strengthening U.S. dollar

&amp;#x200B;

* TTWO: $5,800m - $5,900m (*up $2,050m or 53.2% - 54.7%*)
   * Increase is primarily due to the recent Zynga acquisition
   * Focusing on 2K &amp; Rockstar to exclude the noise from acquisitions &amp; smaller parts of the business, guidance is $3,132m - $3,186m. That's down $243m - $279m or 7.2% - 8.1%.
   * That's assuming mobile &amp; Private Division accounted for 10% of the prior guidance and 46% of the current guidance

&amp;#x200B;

* General Takeaways:
   * ATVI gives no guidance, but it's irrelevant since they're about to be acquired. I also expect results to improve with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and Overwatch II
   * EA did not change their guidance showing that the business is still performing well
   * TTWO was able to show more details about how the business will look with Zynga, but guidance xZynga was weaker due to game delays and some weakness for GTA

&amp;#x200B;

**Latest Price Targets after updating my forecasts:**

* ATVI: $95
   * Based on Microsoft's acquisition price
   * My due diligence on why the deal will go through: [My research on why ATVI is undervalued after Microsoft's acquisition : stocks (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sfoz38/my_research_on_why_atvi_is_undervalued_after/)

&amp;#x200B;

* EA: $130 - $132
   * 15x multiple on FY '23 EBITDA of $2,400m - $2,445m
   * This is aligned with EA's guidance
   * I previously gave the stock a 20x multiple, but valuations are decreasing across the stock market and they have an unusually high amount of EBITDA adjustments this year given their acquisitions. As a result, I lowered my assigned multiple by 5pp.
   * I expect the company to be sold this year or in 2023 based on recent reports that EA is trying to sell itself to big tech. More details: [Report: EA Was Deep In Merger Talks With NBCUniversal (kotaku.com)](https://kotaku.com/ea-acquisition-apex-legends-star-wars-fifa-nbcuniversal-1848957274)
   * A 20x multiple on the same FY '23 EBITDA forecast suggests a $173 - $176 price target

&amp;#x200B;

* TTWO: $114 - $120
   * 20x multiple of FY '23 EBITDA of $1,060m - $1,109m
   * This is aligned with TTWO's guidance
   * I previously gave the stock a 25x multiple, but valuations are decreasing across the stock market and they have an unusually high amount of EBITDA adjustments this year given their Zynga acquisition. As a result, I lowered my assigned multiple by 5pp,
   * Could earn a higher multiple in the future since it's the largest metaverse company on earth that the stock market isn't fully appreciating, Zynga integration upside in 1 -2 years, GTA 6 upside in 3 - 5 years, &amp; could be an attractive acquisition target for big tech that want a top player in gaming &amp; metaverse with a digestible market cap (*only $21 billion*)
   * A 25x multiple on the same FY '23 EBITDA forecast suggests a $146 - $153 price target"|0.87|20|0|20

Although it has existed for 170 years, it is public as of March 2019 (It has also been public between 1971 and 1985 before it was taken private again).

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Levi's?**

In a nutshell, it is one of the world's largest brand-name companies that designs, markets, and sells apparel. You'll notice that manufacturing and distribution are not included in the previous sentence. 

That's because nearly all of the products are sourced &amp; distributed through independent manufacturers. We can definitely debate whether having the manufacturing in-house is better or not, there are pros/cons to each option.

&amp;#x200B;

**The DTC expansion**

If you go through any of their latest quarterly/annual reports, investor presentations, or listen to an interview with their CEO, you'll notice that these three letters DTC appear very often. So, what is DTC and why is it so important?

DTC stands for direct to consumer and it's easiest to illustrate its importance through a simple example. If any of us buys a pair of Levi jeans through their eCommerce or through their retail store or through a third-party store, at the end of the transaction, we have the jeans and we've paid the cash. However, for Levi's, the transaction isn't the same. If the jeans are purchased through a 3rd party retailer, well, they'll get a small percentage of it (Otherwise why would they be selling the jeans in the first place?).

Back in 2011, only 20% of all the revenue came from DTC channels (Ecommerce and company-operated stores). This percentage increased to almost 40% in 2021 and the management is aiming for 60% by 2030.

The more sales they're able to shift to DTC, the higher their gross margin will be.

&amp;#x200B;

**The financials**

In the last 5 years (despite the pandemic), the revenue grew by 5% on average, ($4.9b in 2017 to $6.2b in the last twelve months). This percentage of course indicates the maturity of the company and it would be unreasonable for us to expect double-digit growth rates in the future.

In the same period, their gross profit margin increased from 52% to 58%! This really shows the brand behind the company. In difficult times, also with high inflation, a good brand is able to pass the prices to the final consumer. So far, Levi has been doing a great job in that aspect.

However, the operating expenses as % of revenue have increased, which is not ideal (42% in 2017 to 47% in the last twelve months).

Putting all of this together, we get to the operating margin that has improved from 10% to almost 12%.

&amp;#x200B;

**The management's targets**

The management is aiming for $9-10b in revenue by 2027, that's an annual growth rate of over 8%, way higher than what they delivered in the last 5 years. However, the company is not afraid to acquire other companies if they believe there's a good fit within their portfolio, so this increase in revenue doesn't have to come organically.

As for the margins, they're aiming for 60% gross margin and 15% operating margin. Part of this could be expected by their actions when it comes to the DTC expansion, but there's a lot of work to be done, especially when it comes to managing operating expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

**The balance sheet**

Levi's balance sheet looks quite clean and stable over time, with the exception of inventory. The level of inventory has been between $850 and $900m for the last 4 years and recently it spiked up to $1.1b. What causes it? Based on the data available, inflation and increase in the price of cotton. However, it is something that's to be monitored. One way that management can distort numbers is by ordering higher quantities that they can actually sell. When that happens, they are able to negotiate lower prices per product that immediately improves the gross margin. However, if that is the case, they're also stuck with inventory that they cannot sell, which one can argue is worse.

&amp;#x200B;

**My key assumptions &amp; valuation**

Now, only because the management has big targets, that doesn't mean we should incorporate them in our forecast and take them for granted. My assumptions are as follows:

Revenue: 5% growth for the next 5 years then slowly decreasing to 2.75%.

Operating margin: Slowly improve over time to 12.5%

Discount rate: 7.75% increasing to 8.01%

Based on those assumptions, the fair value is $7.9b (**$20.03/share)**

Current market cap is $7.55b ($19.02/share)

&amp;#x200B;

*Note: I have taken into account the cash, debt, and deferred taxes on their balance sheet as well as the outstanding equity options.*

&amp;#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**

Based on the assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 53% in 10 years and the operating margin will be 12.5%.

I am aware that my assumptions could be significantly wrong. So, let's take a look at how the value of the company (per share) will change based on different assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin: 

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue / Op. margin|10%|12.5%|15%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|40% ($8.8b)|$14.9|$18.8|$22.7|
|53% ($9.5b)|$15.8|$20.0|$24.3|
|86% ($11.6b)|$18.2|$23.3|$28.4|
|100% ($12.5b)|$18.9|$24.3|$29.8|

The intersection of the 3rd row (86% revenue growth) and the 3rd column (15% operating margin) is what the management is aiming for. If they're able to deliver that, then the fair value of Levi's today is a bit over $28/share (A potential upside of over 40% compared to today's share price).

If they deliver the revenue growth without margin improvement or the other way around, the upside is a bit over 20%.

If Powell does do this, it could end a recent rally in growth stocks which has been fuelled by speculation that inflation has peaked and the Reserve Bank will prematurely end the tightening cycle.

“Mr. Powell is widely expected to argue against the arguably-premature loosening in financial conditions that has occurred since the July meeting, attempting to better align market forecasts with the central bank’s own terminal rate projections.

I can see the balance sheet reduction would likely lead to higher long-term interest rates (lower demand for MBS and bonds). This would mean

1. Slowing housing market (higher mortgage rates lead to reduced homebuying)

2. Lower investment (why invest if ROI is barely above bonds)

The two above would lead to a slowing economy, hence lower demand and lower inflation. Is that the reason behind Fed’s balance sheet reduction?"|0.86|80|0|80

Market surely didn't fight the fed in 2020. Is it fighting the fed now?

I read a message here saying that being **bearish** right now is fighting the fed. 

if Fed is being hawkish, being bearish is going with the fed, no?

Does this also mean the pivot is a pipe dream for the rest of the year, or do I have a comprehension problem? All these hawkish Fed guys speaking this past week- just ignore them and do the opposite?

&amp;#x200B;

I read this week that hedge funds have the biggest ever short position right now. Sounds like they've doubled down, after being wrecked in this June july rally.

The rally forced a lot of short covering, which itself contributed to the rally. This suggests that half of the rally was a false rally consisting of previous shorts and momentum riders who probably have weak hands if the trend reverses. 

Assuming shorts are done covering, who else is left to buy up here near the 200 day moving average?

Here is a great Company, Dicks Sporting Goods. With only 9 Billion Market Cap this thing is selling at a Big discount to Intrinsic Value. 2022 Net Income of 1.5 Billion in 2021 it is Trading at only 6 Times 2021 earnings. This company also looks out for the shareholders, Last year the Purchased 1.1 Billion dollars worth of shares and paid 600 Million in Dividends. Have the best Margins in the business. In 2021 38.33 Gross Margin, 16.55% Operating Margin. In retailing this are huge numbers. Financially the company is in great shape with 2.6 Billion in cash. 

Dicks also has great Fucking Managers, Ed Stack the Son of Dick Stack has turned this family business from a store operation to over 850 stores around the country. Ed Stack Fucks the competition for breakfast. Many sports retailers have gone under When the Giant Dicks comes to town. They are used to being the small underdogs but over the last decade they have become the biggest and best sports retailer in the country. There’s really 2 competitors left. 1 being Big 5, I’m not sure if you’ve ever been to Big 5 but we had one in my small town and it was horrible. Always more workers than costumers and never had what you wanted. THEY ARE FUCKED.  

The other competitor is ASO Academy sports and Outdoors, they are a solid competitor (Inside the state of Texas). Outside of Texas they haven’t been able to expand the brand very well. While Dicks has been able to expand in the state. So, the biggest and best retailer in the country has 1 competitor in 1 state. They have also made great strides in their online business, and have a great omnichannel. 

Looking at Big 5’s Margins last year, they were around 11.6% at operating income, while ASO was at 12.7%. With DKS margins at 16.55% this is a huge competitive advantage. Able to profit 4-5 extra dollars for every 100$ of revenue.  

DKS is also much more conservatively financed which puts them much better to handle adverse situations such as inflation,etc. For example DKS has 2.6 Billion in Cash and 2.7 Billion in current assets. Big 5 has 97 million in cash and 270 million in current assets. ASO had 486 million in cash and over 1.1 Billion in current assets. This puts Big 5 and ASO in a much more leveraged situation, where a couple bad quarters or years would really put pressure on them to either issue more shares or more debt in order to pay the bills. Dicks is a much Bigger and stronger company than their rivals. 

Dicks has also landed a major partnership with Nike to get some exclusivity on some of their products. The only negative of this company is that the sports retailing business is going to have lower revenue and profits this year. The retailing business was helped hugely by stimmy checks in 2021. However with Net income of 300 Million in 2019 and going to be around 1 Billion this year, this is still very good net income growth. The 10 years prior to 2021 their average net income increase was 19% a year on average and even if you look at 2019 and its average net income growth for 10 years it was solid with over 8%. That is still a solid growth rate for a company selling so cheap and that buys back a lot of stock. This is a company that is getting bigger and still growing at a good rate. Big 5 and ASO need to be beware: Dicks in the rearview mirror might be bigger than they appear. Dicks is coming for their ass. 

At the end of the first quarter then company had 77 Million shares outstanding. Ed Stack owns 20 Million of the shares. This is a family business he’s worked his entire life at. He ain’t FUCKING selling like Pussyboy RC I’ll tell you that. Then looking at the rest of the insiders they own another 11 Million shares. Most of them aren’t selling those either. So now were looking at a company with 44 million shares outstanding. Then if you count the 4 biggest institutional investors they own another 24 Million shares. If you count all those you’re looking at 20 Million of float, while the company buy’s back a lot of shares.  

In conclusion This is a great company at a great price that has the chance to go to the fucking moon. Already up 50% since June."|0.57|3|0|3
t3_wth5ya|1661028685|stocks|TIL charts of stock prices show moving averages that retroactively remove one-day spikes|"On August 11 this year a number of mid-cap biotech stocks spiked in price by 20-100%. This included the stock of Pacific Biosciences, a company I happen to follow, which increased in price from around $6 to over $12. I showed the chart to my colleagues that day and we speculated about what could’ve caused such crazy price action. A few days later, I was looking at the chart on Google Finance and in my brokerage, and I noticed that the reported maximum value for Pacific Biosciences on August 12 was around $6. This is a whole 100% lower than the true maximum value on that day. This observation also held true for several of the other stocks that spiked that day.

I was aware that the values on the public charts like those based on Yahoo Finance or Google are averaged from the transactions taking place within small windows of time on the scale of a few minutes. However I was unaware that the charts are retroactively averaged again to remove outlier windows that can be up to an hour long like the ones occurring on August 11. For some analyses this outlier averaging could have a considerable impact. Additionally it means that the maximum/minimum prices we read on the charts can be off by a considerable factor like the 100% I observed.

I found it fascinating to realize that I don’t understand how the charts I look at so often are generated and thought I’d share my realization. Does anyone know how the averaging works exactly?

Edit: Reading the comments I realized that my point can be summarized as “Never trust a chart without error bars“.

Edit 2: okay thanks to more comments I now realize I was being dense and some historical line charts only show the price at close for the day and there is no averaging like I thought. Some historical line charts have more granularity though the level of granularity is not immediately apparently when naively looking at the chart (which was my mistake)."|0.72|11|0|11
t3_wtfj9z|1661024245|stocks|Is it worth trying to bounce back from a big loss?|"To no one's surprise, I got burned pretty badly with BBBY. I wasn't even waiting for a squeeze or anything, thought of this as a great albeit risky opportunity to day trade and scalp some profits off the momentum swings. I started well, was in and out in 15 mins, and profited around $1.7K. I got too comfortable and went in again in the last 20 mins from market close when the Ryan Cohen selling his stake news came out. I didn't have time to assess and got caught up in all this. I dropped $33K at $25.8 and stock plummeted to $18. Instead of cutting my losses, I held like a jackass in hopes the news wasn't real and that it would reverse back to $25 for me to exit without a loss. The next day it started to pick up momentum to $19 towards the end which gave me hope that on Friday with a lot of calls ITM, this would surely shoot to $25. After market close, the news became official that RC had sold his entire stake and the stock plummeted completely and my brain couldn't even function. I panicked sold it all and took a $17K loss. Basically cut my capital in half with a 50% loss. 

I thought I learned my lesson from my previous failures with GME and another merger gone wrong but I didn't. I took $40K losses combined on those too.

I seriously thought this would never happen again but getting into this meme crap will always burn someone who got in late and FOMO's even just to day trade. 

I have $26K in cash left and in my mind, I want to revenge trade and get back the $17K I lost. I know options would be my best bet to maximize my returns but if things go south, I will be left with nothing on those so I'm not sure if that's the play. Not sure if day trading options with little price movements would be a way to make quick profits. I've been doing a lot of calculations and strategies on ways to make back the $17K but I'm way too shook. This was obviously money I couldn't lose so I'm really depressed right now. 

I know revenge trading will most likely go wrong and I could possibly put myself in a bigger hole but that lingering feeling to win back my losses is too strong right now. I've already decided to quit trading but I just want that last chance of making my losses back before quitting and transferring everything back to my bank. 

I'm also looking into buying blue chips and just selling aggressive covered calls to get a decent premium. Obviously, if the stock falls, then there goes that plan. Or day trading blue chips where worst case scenario, I'll have to hold onto fundamentally strong companies.

I don't know what to do right now, I thought I learned my lessons from the previous 2 failures but apparently, I have 2 brain cells to function with. I even told myself the importance of cutting losses but when I'm in the trade, I forget that and just irrationally hope it goes back up so I can break even. I could have just sold at $18-19 and taken the hit then. I also planned to sell deep ITM $5 strike covered calls which would have netted me $16k i premiums and a 25% loss instead of 50% but decided against it thinking Friday might rally. Hindsight is 20/20 but not sure why I don't ever learn

t3_wtel4j|1661021703|stocks|How to deal with FOFU - Fear Of Fucking Up|"So I had my first foray with the stock market back in april-may '20 when the Corona crash happened all over the globe. I knew I would have steady income during the entire pandemic from the start as I'm basically a glorified government employee (I'm in education) and I had some leftover savings that I could purpose however I wanted, and seeing how I wouldn't likely be traveling for the time being, I decided to look into stocks.

Now going in I had two basic things in mind: (1) if what comes down has obvious market value, it will go back up eventually. (2) the root cause of the Corona crash was not actual economic malaise, but rather anticipatory panic.

As I was doing research I caught sight of this small company doing gene sequencing (basically mapping out genes in order to identify causes of certain illnesses) called Pacific Biosciences. During the first months of the pandemic their stock was valued between $3-4. A nice price for a smaller company with obvious long term potential, I thought. So I bought a relatively sizeable stake in the company (I mean relative to my entire portfolio).

Then madness ensued. In a good way.

As 2020 closed, the stock started to rise in value. From 3-4 dollars to 8, 9, 13. I put some more money into it up until it hit 20 in december. Then, as the new year was starting up, it hit 30, 40, 50.

I basically just turned my annual holiday payout and some spare change into a small fortune.

As the stock hit $40 I started getting nervous and placed orders to dump the lot as it hit $35. I increased this to $40 as it peaked over that, and $45 as it hit $50. People on Yahoo boards were yelling 'onwards to $60' and even though it felt like I was dreaming, it was a lot more like sleep paralysis than a nice floaty cloud dream. I had to actively stop looking at the stock value real time in order to have any peace of mind at day. I'd wake up at 8, work from 9-16, then get on Yahoo to watch my stocks from 16 'til close.

So I started detoxing myself. A couple of days later I got a message saying my position had been sold. I now have a little over a year's wages in the bank. Which is absolutely awesome. This is life-changing money as it is.

The thing is though - it's just sitting there. Real estate is not an option even with this money as I don't meet the monthly income requirements for pretty much any type of mortgage and it's not enough by far to just straight up buy a house. I never got around to rebuying any sort of stocks when my position in PACB got sold. The interest on my savings account is negative at the moment, and it's a large enough sum to have to pay taxes over, so I now have this small fortune sitting in the bank that's just bleeding out, and I don't really know what to do with. I got so incredibly lucky on literally my first run - granted, I had some other stocks but as I saw PACB was exploding I just put everything in there, like an absolute dipshit - and I am so extremely aware that I will never ever see this success again, that I'm literally afraid to do anything with this money but just keep it where it is.

How do I deal with THIS? How do I deal with the idea that whatever I do, I'm not going to peak like that, that it's far more likely I'll just lose my money? Because in my current situation, I actually AM just losing my money."|0.77|16|0|16

The politics around the issue is irrelevant to us as technical traders, yet it is still possible to get a few glimpses through the fog ahead.

[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/us/politics/house-climate-tax-bill.html): “The legislation would pour more than $370 billion into climate and energy programs aimed at helping the United States cut greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 40 percent below 2005 levels by the end of the decade. It would also extend for three years expanded subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, as well as fulfill a long-held Democratic goal to lower the cost of prescription drugs by allowing Medicare to directly negotiate prices and capping the annual out-of-pocket cost for recipients at $2,000.”

“The package would be financed largely by tax increases, including a new tax on company stock buybacks and a 15 percent corporate minimum tax for wealthy companies. Initial analyses of the legislation found that it could reduce the nation’s deficit by as much as $300 billion over a decade.”

From an investment standpoint, who will likely win from this? A preliminary list should include:

\-Alternative energy companies

\-Companies that refit existing structures

\-Companies focusing on carbon capture, which includes new investment in this area by some big oil trying to leverage their offshore operations ability into building &amp; operating these facilities.

Various healthcare endpoint providers - will avoid a drop in revenue because of ACA extension &amp; likely see an increase in profits due to lowered costs with somewhat less lowered prices passed on.

Who will likely lose?

\-Big pharma &amp; their major distributors due to reduced margins.

\-Big oil - will still be very profitable, just somewhat less so.

\-Large cap &amp; others hit with the 15% tax will be adversely affected on what they can’t shield.

\-The tax on company buybacks affects everyone, but not equally. When they have too much money, some companies prefer a buyback to a dividend. Smaller companies who want to go private will now find it more expensive to do so, as this makes it pricier to reduce the float.

How will this affect me in the next month? - It likely won’t, although some of these healthcare stocks may see a small rise in support levels.

How about the next quarter? - Again, healthcare or anything that benefits from the extension of a policy. Beyond that, it all depends how quickly these funds are allocated and distributed. As we saw in 2020, the government can flood massive amounts of money quickly when they are so inclined.

And next year? - What am I, a friggin’ crystal ball? There’s a potential recession looming, and if it hits, that government spending will help buoy certain parts of the economy, which will then likely perform better than the overall economy. 

###### So what should I do?

My NFA answer is to start researching some of these industries to look for specific opportunities. As you whittle the list down, look at the news for each candidate. Read it. Dig deeper=due diligence. Search out university breakthroughs in the field anytime you see something on one of your feeds. See if they have other things already licensed, e.g., or potentially who may have funded or will most immediately benefit from the research. When you find your final list, take micro-positions of 1-10 shares in 3-5 of these candidates. This will allow you to track them in your portfolio, and having a few dollars in a stock always makes it more interesting. To some extent, forget back testing. We are in a somewhat novel moment in time here. Track these stocks for as long as you need in this no stress setting, as none of your mistakes will likely cost more than a good lunch. You can add a little at a time on pullbacks, or make a bigger commitment as the situation warrants. The idea is to build positions of a percent or two of several companies from this research as part of your wealth-building portfolio. Employing this strategy across a number of stocks can also act as a buffer in your account, preventing you from getting massively wiped out if you develop a case of Yolofomo fever."|0.59|6|0|6

A little bit about my stock trading history. As a newbie, I would take advice from advance stock traders. The problem was that I would end up investing in stock that was popular and supposed to have a quick turnaround. This is great for day traders, but I'm trying to go back to step 1. I would like to invest my money in stock that I can keep in there long-term even if the growth is slow. I find nothing wrong with day trading, but I need more experience before I jump to the next level.

Items highlighted in yellow indicate a ‘Sale of securities on an exchange or to another person (after option exercise)’

Is this necessarily a bad thing? If I understand correctly, insiders can receive stock options as a form of compensation that allow them to purchase shares of the company at a discount price. They only have a certain amount of time to execute their options or else they loose them.

If the insiders own a considerable amount of shares, say 20%, does a lot of activity in this area indicate trouble or just that they’re exercising options otherwise they’ll lose them?"|1.0|8|0|8
t3_wt7cf2|1661002712|stocks|BABA DCA, $ or €?|"Hi, I have a very heavy bag of BABA stocks. 

Specifically I have 100xBABA with cost basis €234 and 10xBABA with cost basis $153.5. 

I live in Europe. 

I’m thinking of DCAing buying around 90 more stocks. 

First question: Should I not? In my opinion and according to any analyst that I have read BABA continues to be fundamentally completely undervalued. China is always a risk but I want to believe eventually they will be allowed to operate normally. However there is even the uncertainty with Taiwan now so maybe it’s really another wrong moment and could end up with heavier bags. 

Second: If I do it, should I increase my position in € or $? My currency is €, but if I increased my $ exposure I would completely remove currency risk from the portfolio (right?). Currently EUR has dropped relative to USD. 

There is a downside to having $. If I understand correctly in my country I don’t pay capital gains if I invest through Frankfurt exchange but I’m not 100% sure if I invest instead through NYSE. 

Third question: If I do it, would you recommend throwing it at once? Adding like 10 stocks every week? 10 every month? 

To help you skip one calculation, if I bought 90 shares right now, I would drop my cost basis to ~167€/$."|0.65|8|0|8

What to keep, what to sell already, etc. This is not money I need to use anytime soon, but is money that hurts me with all the losses incurred and its hard to accept selling some of those at their current price levels. 

Here are my bags (current prices in parenthesis):

WISH: 1000shares @$7.8 ($1.45)

CLNE: 1200 shares @$9.45 ($7.49)

MVST: 1700 shares @$8.3 ($2.61)

PLTR: 1000 shares @$13.25 ($8.51)

SUMO: 300 shares @$15.23 ($8.11)

BABA: 110 shares @$234 ($89.61)

The current MV is around 35.7k$ while the original MV is 76.8k$, marking a loss of 41.1k $. 

My total balance from investments is -25k$, given that I have closed some positive positions and I have some money on index funds that are helping out. 

What are your opinions? Which ones should I just accept the loss and which ones could get even worse? Which ones would you hold? 

I’m hoping that CLNE and PLTR could rebound to their original prices. But who knows, maybe they’ll also slowly dip to 2$… 

BABA is the one that hurts the most and that I guess most people would expect to eventually rebound at least to some level. 

MVST also really hurts. I’m hoping it will rebound at least a bit, maybe to 4$? What should be my target to sell and accept the loss?

Thanks for the help.

EDIT: At the current prices, these positions are around 30% of my total cash+ investments. My net income is around 6k per month, able to save around 50% of that."|0.6|4|0|4

* **The stock was down around 63% in mid-afternoon trade in London.**
* **The company is reportedly expected to file a chapter 11 petition in the U.S. and is considering filing an insolvency proceeding in the U.K.**

Shares of British cinema chain [Cineworld Group](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CINE-GB) plunged Friday on reports that it is preparing to file for bankruptcy after failing to entice viewers back to movie theatres following a pandemic lull.

The stock was down around 63% in mid-afternoon trade in London, up just slightly from earlier Friday, when it hit a record low of 1.8 pence per share.

It follows [reports first cited in The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/regal-cinemas-owner-cineworld-prepares-for-bankruptcy-filing-11660910944) that the company, which owns Regal Cinemas, had engaged a team of lawyers and consultants to advise on the bankruptcy process, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company is expected to file a chapter 11 petition in the U.S. and is considering filing an insolvency proceeding in the U.K., they said.

Cineworld did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment.

## Fewer big-budget movies hurt attendance

Cineworld, which operates 9,000 theaters in 10 countries,[ warned Wednesday that a lack of blockbusters](https://www.reuters.com/business/uks-cineworld-warns-low-footfall-theatres-persist-2022-08-17/) was hurting admissions and would likely persist until November, impacting the company’s liquidity.

It is the latest casualty of the movie theater industry, which has struggled to regain its footing following coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, with viewers increasingly inclined to stream movie releases at home.

Box office [ticket sales are down 30% compared to 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/16/avatar-rogue-one-and-spider-man-no-way-home-return-to-theaters.html). Meantime, there have been 30% fewer movies released in theaters owing to filming disruptions during the pandemic and a tendency for some production companies to release directly to streaming platforms.

Shares of other U.S. theater companies AMC and CNK were both down around 5% in mid-morning trade, recovering slightly from an earlier dip.

Cineworld said Wednesday that despite the success of hits such as “Top Gun: Maverick” and some Marvel movies, not enough big films were hitting cinemas.

“Despite a gradual recovery of demand since re-opening in April 2021, recent admission levels have been below expectations,” the company said.

Cineworld’s net debt stood at [$8.9 billion at the end of 2021](https://www.cineworldplc.com/sites/cineworld-plc/files/reports-presentation/2022/annual-report-2021.pdf) compared to revenues of $1.8 billion.

Law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP and consultants from AlixPartners are said to be advising on the bankruptcy proceedings, according to the WSJ.

Neither were available for comment when contacted by CNBC."|0.87|22|0|22

The price will then fluctuate for a while and depending on the company's performance and the market's expectation of the company the stock will either run up(good news) or sell off(bad news). If the earnings surprise was positive and the market has good expectations for the company's future performance, the price actually reaches near the price of wall street analysts' price target.

People have lost trust in the Chinese real estate purchase model. It worked as a Ponzi scheme.  Using your money to build my building first . The developers could also get loans from banks once they bought the land with their client's money. These developers were highly indebted because of this.

Most buildings were being built in towns without a dynamic economy.  These towns relied on the sale of land as their income. 

Lastly there is a whole supply chain of plumbers, appliances, elevators etc that will go broke along with the developers.

The government solution has been to instruct the local governments to finish off construction.  Not a great plan.

This is a much more serious problem than many realize . The real estate sector represents 35% of their economy. It could slow their development for several years . And confidence is very low in the business sector. Covid Zero policy also has resulted in thousands of small businesses that had to shut down.

t3_wst3pc|1660954177|stocks|My Plan- Do what you will with this information|"By now we have all heard about meme traders gambling on trash stocks to make a quick profit. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it doesn’t. In essence, this mindset is the exact opposite of normal investing. Despite this difference in investment ideology, there may be something that we can learn from the apes. 

They have leveraged Reddit communities to spread investment ideas. What is unique about the phenomenon in my mind is that they have convinced large amounts of people to all invest in a certain stock at a certain time. 

The downfall of their plan is that it only works if people keep their positions, and it is inevitably short lived due to the volatility. The companies they target have little to no future value, so the only reason to hold on to stocks is the blind faith that others will do the same. There is no end game plan, and the final bag holders will inevitably get burned.

Imagine a hypothetical scenario where a large group focuses on a single quality company that has the ability to (1) provide value for many years (2) continue to grow as a company and (3) continue to grow their dividend for income as the people age.

I am 29 and I plan on investing in MSFT for the long term (25+ years) unless something fundamentally changes with the company. I have a dividend growth mindset due to my age and I know that does not work/apply to everyone. I will be dollar cost averaging $100 a week into their stock for the foreseeable future.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 22nd, 2022.

# **Stocks fall Friday to notch weekly loss, S&amp;P 500 snaps 4-week-long rally - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/18/stock-market-news-live-updates-futures-open-to-close.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks tumbled on Friday as Wall Street’s summer rally faltered and rate hike fears resurfaced, leading the major averages to end the week on a sour note.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.29% to close at 4,228.48, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 292.30 points, or 0.86%, to 33,706.74. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.01% to settle at 12,705.22.
*****
&gt; For the week, the S&amp;P edged 1.21% lower, while the Dow slipped 0.16%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed out the week down 2.62%.
*****
&gt; Friday’s halt in Wall Street’s summer rally came as minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting and comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard indicated that the central bank would likely continue hiking rates in the near term, putting a damper on investors’ hopes of a slowdown.
*****
&gt; Despite the week’s moves, many investors and traders are holding out hope for a bounce back.
*****
&gt; “I wouldn’t expect a complete reversal going back to the June lows or something like that, however, the choppiness we’re seeing today and this week does reflect a lot of the bear case that’s out there,” said FBB Capital Partners’ Mike Bailey. “I think seeing the market trade sideways or seeing a bit of a pause in that rally definitely makes sense based on some of the facts that we’re seeing out there.”
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares cratered more than 40% after Ryan Cohen dumped his entire stake in the retailer. The move seemed to dampen sentiment among meme stock traders who have bet big on the company in recent months.
*****
&gt; In other news, about a $2 trillion notional value worth of options contracts expired on Friday. Options expirations can add volatility to markets as some holders may be forced to move into their positions.

&gt; Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble madness. Although September’s overall rank improves modestly in midterm years going back to 1950, average losses widen for DJIA (–0.8%), NASDAQ (–0.8%), Russell 1000 (–1.0%) and Russell 2000 (–0.8%). S&amp;P 500’s average September loss improves slightly from –0.5% to –0.4% in midterm years. Although September 2002 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA has declined in 11 of the last 18 midterm-year Septembers.

&gt; # Total Return vs Price Change Spreads

&gt; As we mentioned in today's Chart of the Day, there can be a wide spread between total returns and price change based on dividend yield. Although it doesn't always make financial sense for a company to pay dividends, they can certainly magnify returns all else equal. Click here to start a two-week trial to Bespoke Premium and receive our paid content in real-time.

&gt; The table below outlines twenty S&amp;P 500 stocks that have seen a high percentage of their returns over the last twenty years come from dividends. The average stock on this list has seen over 80% of their gains over the last two decades come from dividends alone. Although the average stock on this list has only seen a price gain of 61.1% since August of 2002, their average total return when factoring in dividends re-invested has been 278%.

&gt; To show you what we mean, below is a chart of price change versus total return over the last 20 years for Altria Group (MO). As you can see, the dividend in this case turns a below average stock into an outperformer.

&gt; # Bulls Set a New High

&gt; Bullish sentiment continued its recent run of increases according to the weekly AAII individual investor sentiment survey. Hitting 33.3% this week, bulls are at the highest level since the last week of 2021. That 2022 is nearly 2/3 complete and we still haven't seen a bullish reading over 33.3% tells you how negative investors have been this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Bears also ticked up this week reaching 37.2% versus 36.7% last week. While bearish sentiment has only been below 40% for three weeks in a row, that is the longest stretch of sub-40% readings since the start of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; With more bears than bulls once again this week, the bull-bear spread has now been negative for 20 straight weeks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-5.png))**

&gt; With both bulls and bears higher, neutral sentiment was the only reading to fall this week. Neutral sentiment dropped 1.7 percentage points from 31.2% down to 29.5%. That was only the lowest reading in four weeks as neutral sentiment sits the closest to its historical average of 31.4%.

&gt; # 10-Day A/D Line Overbought for 15 Days

&gt; In an earlier tweet, we pointed out the elevated readings across 10-day advance decline lines in our Sector Snapshot. Not only is the 10-Day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500 approaching one-year highs (as of yesterday's close), but it has been ""overbought"" for the last 15 trading days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-10-day.png))**

&gt; Going back to the start of our data in 1990, there have only been eight other times in which the S&amp;P 500's 10-day A/D line has been overbought for 15 days in a row or more. The last time such a steak was observed was at the start of 2019 which ended at 22 days. That tied for the March 2016 streak for the longest on record back to 1990. We would also note that other than one streak in the first couple of months of 1991, nearly all of these long streaks with an overbought 10-day A/D line occurred since 2010. In other words, consistently impressive breadth by this measure has largely been a recent phenomenon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Streak1.png))**

&gt; This is not the only impressive breadth signal we have covered of late. For example, in yesterday's Chart of the Day we highlighted that more than 90% of S&amp;P 500 stocks were above their 50-DMAs. Prior times when we've seen that reading spike above 90% have been followed by strong returns in the months and year ahead. Looking at the past times in which the 10-day advance decline line has been overbought for 15 days in a row, forward performance of the S&amp;P 500 has not been considerably stronger than the norm. From that 15th day, the S&amp;P has risen half the time one week out. One and three month returns are more consistently positive but weaker than the norm on a median basis. In the year after the long overbought A/D streaks listed below, though, the S&amp;P was higher 7 of 8 times for an average gain of 11.1%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Table.png))**

&gt; Below is a chart of the S&amp;P 500 since its 2009 Financial Crisis low. As shown, most of these overbought A/D line streaks have occurred as the index was recovering from some sort of sell off. Only one of them (in early 2018) came about at the time of a notable peak in the index.

&gt; # Moving Averages Putting Up a Fight

&gt; Just as the S&amp;P 500 ran into some resistance yesterday at its 200-day moving average (DMA), we've seen the same pattern play out in a number of commodities. Two of the more high-profile ones have been copper and crude oil.

&gt; Copper fell out of bed in the late spring and early summer, losing a third of its value. Along with the equity market, copper has seen a late-summer rally, but things came to a screeching halt right at the 50-DMA last Thursday. Copper has been down on two of the last three trading days and hasn't been able to trade back above that elusive 50-DMA since.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Copper.png))**

&gt; Crude oil has been just as weak as copper lately, trading in a well-defined downtrend and breaking below its 200-DMA in early August. There was a little bit of a bounce last week, but resistance came into play at the 200-DMA, and after making another lower high, it has since made another lower low.

&gt; When stock, commodity, bond, or any other asset class is in a well-defined downtrend, the first thing they have to do to break out of their funks is clear resistance at key moving averages like the 50 and/or 200-DMA. In the case of copper and crude, they have both recently come up short. The S&amp;P 500, again, is facing some resistance at its 200-DMA, but at least it has managed to clear its 50-DMA which it did in the second half of July.

&gt; # Summer Rally Top: Almanac Aggregate Cycle

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/7e8069b2c2bd4e8de914d770f3d6de87/4c5d67735406068a-67/s500x750/5166d3e30c8566f6c5b3725cdf1409b76e765d5a.jpg))**

&gt; Bear market rally or new bull, the 2022 summer rally looks like its run it’s course. With the summer rally pushing DJIA up 13.5% from the June low with S&amp;P up 17.2% and NASDAQ up 23.3% here’s what we are looking at.

&gt; This impressive comeback rally pushed through technical resistance at the June highs. But our indicators and cycles analysis suggest another leg down that culminates in a lower low or retest of the lows at some point in the weak seasonal period August-October ahead of the midterm election.

&gt; Last week’s inflation numbers were certainly encouraging. But we would like to see further confirmation before moving into the bullish camp. We are bullish for Q4 and 2023 but remain vigilant about the potential for another leg down that either tests the June lows or makes a new low.

&gt; In preparation for the 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac, we developed this brand-new Stock Trader’s Almanac Aggregate Cycle index (STAAC). STA Aggregate Cycle is a combination of the 1-Year Seasonal Pattern for All Years, the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle and the Decennial Cycle. In the chart here STAAC is all years, midterm years and second years of decades post-WWII from 1946-2021.

&gt; # Housing Descending

&gt; Updates on Building Permits and Housing Starts were mixed relative to expectations for July. While Building Permits exceeded forecasts by 34K, Housing Starts missed forecasts by 81K falling to the lowest annualized rate (1.446 million) since February 2021. Housing represents a large share of the US economy on both a direct and indirect basis, so its health says about the state of the overall economy, Below we have updated our chart of Housing Starts on an average 12-month basis overlaid on top of recessions. Every recession since the late 1960s has been preceded by a rollover in the average rate of Housing Starts, and usually, the rollover starts well in advance of the recession.

&gt; For the current period, Housing Starts remain right near their highest levels of the cycle, but if you look real closely, you can see that the level peaked three months ago. Looking out over history, there are plenty of other periods where Starts declined for a few months but didn't roll over. In other words, based on what we've seen so far, Housing Starts have yet to show signals of an imminent recession. Based on this month's reading and the readings from a year ago, barring a major rebound, the 12-month average is likely to keep declining in the months ahead. Another factor to keep in mind about the historical relationship between Housing Starts and recessions is that in most cases, the recession didn't usually begin until months after the peak of Housing Starts.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Housing-Starts-12-M.png))**

&gt; Taking a closer look at recent trends, the chart below shows the 12-month average of Building Permits and Housing Starts since the start of 2010. It's easier here to see the decline in Starts over the last few months. Building Permits, meanwhile, have continued to trend higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Starts-and-Permits.png))**

&gt; On a single-family basis, though, both Building Permits and Housing Starts have shown signs of rolling over. Single-family Housing Starts have been moving sideways for over a year now and have just recently seen an acceleration in the rate of decline while Building Permits have been trending lower for a full year now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Starts-and-Permits-Single.png))**

&gt; Finally, the chart below compares the performance of Housing Starts over time to the performance of homebuilder stocks using the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) as a proxy. While the two have tended to track each other over time, over the last couple of months, ITB has rallied while Housing Starts have been dropping. Either the market knows something about future developments in the residential housing market or investors have gotten a little offside in their positioning.

t3_wspwmu|1660945583|stocks|"Shorting ""vegan"" stocks longterm is safe and easy money"|"During 2020 and 2021 many vegan-alternative stocks like beyond meat and oatly increased rapidly. Now with inflation, recession and interest rates growing they have gone down alot.
But how well will they survive this economic situation?

Take oatly for example.
Their p/e is around -7
They have around 1.7$ per share in capital(share price: 3.4$)
Their revenue is growing but they are still very unprofitable meaning 
Increased revenue = increased losses

People are strugeling financially and they just dont care about these alternatives to the real stuff. The real stuff like milk and meat is cheaper so people choose that stuff instead. 
It will take years untill wages catch up with inflation so Oatly for example must continue with low, unprofitable prices or they must increase prices wich will kill their revenue. This will make them have multiple bad quarters with bad results and bad forecasts.

So shorting them should be easy money.


Tldr
Vegan-alternative stocks like oatly and beyond meat are trash. They are unprofitable and they will continue to be for many years. They wont be able to raise capital without crashing their shareprice.

So short them.


Not financial advise. Just pure speculation.

t3_wsmmt7|1660937309|stocks|Setting and Forgetting SPY, NDAQ, Bank Stocks|"I've been looking at YOY returns over the past 5 years for stocks, the SNP500 (how different is it to the SPY ETF?) is up 72% over the past 5 years, NDAQ is up 147% with an additional dividend of 0.43% annually, while bank stocks (TD, RY, JPM) have more modest growth of only about 20-30%, but have dividends around 3-4% annually, with the largest return I've found being TD at a growth of 34% and dividends of 4.09% annually. 

My parents are big fans of bank stocks precisely because of their large dividends, but doing the math at best you'd get say a 34x(1.04\^5) = 40 percent return on investment over five years. 

This just seems strictly worse than keeping everything in one of the two other stocks I mentioned. Now, granted, bank stocks seem more stable and they have comparable growth over all time (is this a worthwhile metric?) but if I decide to invest over the long term (10+ years), I don't see bank stocks even with high dividends beating the large strict value increase of the SPY or NDAQ. 

Is there something I'm missing? Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.

2% of portfolio with 10 shares of QQQM with an average cost of 156.48$ (also been a meh investment so far lol)

Currently its valued at around 72k and I am 25 years old (for the purpose of investing timelines). I am pretty bullish on Apple and don't see it doing bad; however, I would appreciate honest feedback on if I am being a lunatic or if I am being semi-reasonable with my allocations. To clarify, I am pulling back on investing in Apple at the moment and my current plan is to keep my shares and rebalance my portfolio by adding more VOO overtime.

I also hope that via META's impressive balance sheets that overtime they will reach higher stock prices again. I personally think the stock is undervalued and that the metaverse isn't necessary to succeed in order for the company to print money.

I bought QQQM towards the peak so my saltiness towards it may be unwarranted lol.

3. Are you a compulsive gambler unwilling to even understand the odds of your success let alone the viability of any given trade?
4. If you already know everything you are incapable of learning. Relearn everything you know about what you are doing but focus that information on knowing how your own emotions trigger your behavior instead of your knowledge and discipline.
5. Study the role money will play in the time line of your life and the impact you wish it to have. Gain a mastery of your own risk literacy and how your tolerance for risk, because you don't understand it, is limiting your success.

I believe nuclear energy is going to experience a dramatic increase in the upcoming years and I wonder if someone could point me in the right direction to invest. I’m interested in nuclear energy stocks with presence in Europe, where I think growth will be exponential. Needles to say I would be long on any of these stocks. Any ticker suggestion for me?

#[Stock futures fall, putting S&amp;P 500 on track to snap a 4-week winning streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/18/stock-market-news-live-updates-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were lower on Friday, dimming hopes that the S&amp;P 500 could grind out another positive week.
*****
&gt; Futures for the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.93%, while those tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 260 points, or 0.77%. Nasdaq 100 futures slid 1.03%.
*****
&gt; For the week, the S&amp;P 500 entered Friday’s session up just 0.08%, and the Dow was up 0.7% in that time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq came into Friday riding a 0.6% weekly loss. The S&amp;P 500 has posted a gain in each of the last four weeks.
*****
&gt; While this week has seen relatively muted moves on Wall Street, it comes on the heels of a solid rally since mid-June.
*****
&gt; “The market is doing a little consolidating this week, a little flip-flopping. ... I think this is still a healthy market,” said Frank Gretz, a technical analyst at Wellington Shields, citing solid advance-decline ratios in recent weeks.
*****
&gt; There are no major economic reports due out on Friday, but traders are still parsing through some key earnings. Applied Materials shares rose slightly in the premarket on the back of a better-than-expected quarterly report.

t3_wsba8o|1660907538|stocks|The ultimate long term ETF &amp; stock portfolio|"I want everyone to be successful and make money. All over r/stocks and other similar subs I am seeing people crying about the recent BBBY stock fiasco. Make this a reality check that if it seems too good to be true it probably is. Reminds me of when I was a gambling addict and thought I could beat the casino years ago. 

I will say what others have pointed out on this sub in the past. If you had held each of the following ETFs or stocks you would in every single situation find your money, 10 years ago to today, at least double. What I will also do is show how much money you will have in 10 years from now, assuming the same performance in the US stock market. I believe we are headed for a recession in 2023, but I also believe we will see an overall similar mid term performance between now and 2032 with the below ETFs and stocks (yes, even with Tesla). I will provide what percentage of the portfolio each ETF or stock should be, along with the past 10 year and if repeated what the next 10 year return will be (not even including dividends) if you had invested only $1,000 in 2012 AND also what your return would be if you invested only $1,000 today and wait until 2032: 

**VOO** \[40% of portfolio\] ... 2012 ($129 per share) to 2022 ($393) return = 204% return 

\&gt; 2022 ($393) to 2032 with a 204% return would equate to VOO being at **$1,195** 

\&gt;&gt; $1,000 invested in 2022 with a 204% return would equate to ***$3,040*** (not including dividends) 

&amp;#x200B;

**TQQQ** \[20% of portfolio\] ... 2012 ($1.17 per share) to 2022 ($37.55) return = 3,109% return 

\&gt; 2022 ($37.55) to 2032 with a 3,109% return would equate to TQQQ being at **$1,205** 

\&gt;&gt; $1,000 invested in 2022 with a 3,109% return would equate to ***$32,090*** (no dividend is paid on TQQQ) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Alphabet Class C** \[20% of portfolio\] ... 2012 ($16.93 per share) to 2022 ($120.17) return = 609% return 

\&gt; 2022 ($120.17) to 2032 with a 609% return would equate to Alphabet Class C being at **$853** 

\&gt;&gt; $1,000 invested in 2022 with a 609% return would equate to ***$7,098*** (not including dividends) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Apple** \[10% of portfolio\] ... 2012 ($23.69 per share) to 2022 ($174.15) return = 635% return 

\&gt; 2022 ($174.15) to 2032 with a 635% return would equate to Apple being at **$1,281** 

\&gt;&gt; $1,000 invested in 2022 with a 635% return would equate to ***$7,355*** (not including dividends) 

&amp;#x200B;

The remainder of my portfolio is made up of Tesla, Microsoft, Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) and I always keep about 5% of my portfolio in cash to buy during corrections quickly. Each of these has at least a 200% return on investment (SCHD is closer to 196% but remember this is a high dividend ETF). 

This is a reality check and a reminder for us, including myself, that the best thing a person can do is put money in things like VOO, TQQQ, and other profitable mega/large cap stocks with good track records and not check them every single day or try to beat the market. The articles about dead people who were not selling in panic during the start of the pandemic make sense now. Your $1,000 put into the first 4 companies listed above ($4,000) would be **$49,583.** Even if we go into a recession, which could mean TQQQ goes down to $1 you are still going to come out on top in 10 years. Set it and forget it."|0.56|6|0|6
t3_wsa4cg|1660903561|stocks|What is the catch on a 401k loan?|"My 401k is through fidelity, so I borrow money from my 401k, I pay back myself, plus I pay myself interest (confused why i need to pay myself interest as a side question). No taxes, or penalties. What's the catch? Just that I miss the market move on the money I borrowed?

I dont believe now is a great time to pull money out and miss the recovery I expect leading into the end of the year. But when I expect a top has been put in, taking out a 401k loan, could help me avoid the drop? As it would be like selling the top, and as I pay back the loan, buying the dip.

Do they need to see the loan was specific for something, or can i just get cut a check? With no taxes or penalties, I could roll 12k of that money into me and my wife roth? (Can manage my roth more day to day then a 401k. Time in the Market, I know, but I like to trade around a core strategy with my long term positions, and it works for me.)

Only risk I see is with the loan is employment, anything could happen, but I'm union, and 3rd in seniority so It's not a concern. What other catch am I not seeing?"|0.91|189|0|189

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

t3_ws66dk|1660888891|stocks|Australian ASX AGL Energy|"Hi, from time to time, I share news of stocks that I'm watching or holding, it seems to be the original objectives of this sub. Here goes:

Position:

1. Started Feb2022 @ AVG $6.90
2. Currently @ AVG $7.11 (Yes my first average up)
3. I have limit orders (Good Till 26th Aug) for $7.95, $7.85, $7.75, $7.65, $7.55, $7.45, $7.35, $7.25, $7.15, $7.05 and a larger order @ $6.95. So far I have caught as low as $7.75.
4. Admittedly I lost a bit of patience after waiting 6 months for its price to drop below my AVG. This could be my downfall here, we'll see.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AGL Energy is Australia's largest electricity generator and largest carbon emitter. As such, it becomes a target of take-over (possibly for privatisation) by Brookfield Asset Management (owned by Aussie billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes of Atlassian tech company), so that Mike can accelerate the closure of AGL's coal plants (and save the earth).

Brookes (I use Brookes interchangeably for the asset company and Mike since they're operating with the same goal) offered $7.50 (traded $7.15) in Feb, got rejected, offered $8.25 two weeks later (traded $7.40), got rejected again. AGL had a plan to split into retail and wholesale, and the plan was already well on the way, then Brookes acquired about 15% of shares, threatening to vote against the split (which required 75% shareholder approval). So in May, the split was cancelled before the vote, causing AGL both chairman and CEO to resign. The stock has since been trading around $8.50 (until today....).

Today's annual report showed a profit of $225M vs $537M last year (\~60% drop, due to power plant outage and lower wholesale price), it also wrote off $125million due to the failed split. Dividend drops from 34cents a year ago to 10cents (\~70% drop).

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why am I increasing my position?

\[1\] Morningstar's FairValue is $13.30, my target is always -40% of this FV, which is $7.98, so anything below is a green light for me. Why am I trusting Morningstar instead of doing my own technical analysis and DD?

1. I believe Morningstar has more smarter people and better data than me. Who am I to think I can do a better DD than a company with more brighter people and better access to data?
2. That said, I take Morningstar's FV with a grain of salt, and the grain is 40% discount off its FV.

\[2\] If the loss of profit is mostly due to outage and hedged wholesale prices, I believe these will pass. The extended outage is due to lack of specialised parts (maybe some screws or washers from China). The outage is estimated to cost $60M profit, I find it hard to believe they'll let this outage continue for too long now that the cost-and-benefit is out in the open. If these specialised parts cannot be produced @ $1M, how about giving some factories $10M to produce them by yesterday, no? How about $20M? I believe nothing cannot be solved at the right price. Additionally with reduced energy output from the outage (25% of its generation capacity), wholesale price will only go up, even though it's currently suppressed by government pressure.

\[3\] I'm sure Brookes has an axe to grind with his country's largest polluter and his action has caused and will continue to cause harm and loss of value to the company. As a billionaire, I think he's egoistic and but as an Aussie, I believe he will show some restraints (unlike Musk) and want to emerge as a hero. It's likely that he will eventually take control of the company (his networth is $15B vs AGL's $5B), and once it is under his control, he has no option but to turn it into a clean energy producer (to prove his intention and maintain his clean image). He has offered $8.25 before, so his valuation of the company is definitely higher than $8.25 (he didn't become a billionaire by overpaying things). So in long term he's going to turn the company into something that is suitable for future generations and it seems he has the will and means to do that.

\[4\] Lastly and sadly, I believe our reliance on dirty energy is something that is hard to shake off. If we look at Europe's energy crisis, once Russia turns off the tap, the priority and narrative immediately shift from ""turning green"" to ""producing enough to survive"". So in short term, our insatiable appetite for energy (due to heatwave, industrial growth etc) is going to keep producers like AGL afloat for a long while.

Appreciate any comments, and please do your own DD if you want to get in, I'm in the different position with lower AVG and have already received one round of dividend. I waited until the market is closed to post this, so that you won't FOMO and have the whole weekend to digest and decide. Thanks!"|0.79|5|0|5
t3_ws48hf|1660882469|stocks|Stop Loss'ed if I do, FOMO'ed if I don't|"I've been into stock market trading for a good amount of time now. I'm able to analyze basic charts to include patterns, support/resistance levels, EMA's, earnings, current news, the greeks, implied volatility, etc. But for the longest time have my experience with trading defied all that I've learned about the stock market, and felt that the essentials and basics behind trading go straight out the window.

I've even resorted to joining paid Discords. I will do very well at some point, then the next following weeks it will be loss after loss after loss. When it comes to the point to where my port is extremely exhausted to take any more plays, the market rallies. Everyone is taking profits. All the gains they've acquired are shared in their chats while I just stare at the screen, angry. 

Some may say, ""risk management"". Set stop losses. Only invest what you're willing to risk. Do your own research. Just don't trade at all since it's clearly not for you. Re-learn the basics of investing. Set some periodic goals for yourself.

Now out in the real world it's fairly common knowledge for some, if not most investors, and for the millionaires out there, it's a given. It's easier to say, and certainly practice and live by when most of your lifestyle is centered around stock market investing, and by this day you've already developed an excellent but modest portfolio. But if you're an aspiring trader who's trying to learn, and looks up to the most seasoned traders in a Discord chat, you follow their plays or you miss out.

It's also safe to say that if you've followed virtually all the alerts, considering their track record (may vary) your gains will, time to time, outweigh your losses. But if you're part of the other half, who just happen to take all the wrong trades at the wrong time/economic climate, and left too exhausted to take the ones that actually succeed, everything starts to run amok. You start to doubt the Discord. You start to doubt yourself, and virtually everything you've learned about the stock market. You question your own sense of goal and achievement. You demote yourself from ""aspiring trader"", to arguably ""an idiotic trader"". Since it seems you don't know any better about the market anymore, you start blindly taking trades from Discords, hoping the gains outweigh the losses, but it doesn't. And all the stop losses and mind games start to compound and compound until you're completely drained. 

That's where I feel I'm currently at right now. Make no mistake - I am where I'm at today because I follow the basic and essential principles. I'm down substantially the past 4 years, and I've been striving to slowly build it back up the past couple months. But each time I'm making real progress, I suddenly get put back in my place - one step forward, three steps back every time. There are clearly some more advanced variables that I don't know about which everyone's using, and pretending they don't exist.

Who else has felt this way? How do you deal with losing on every trade you take, and FOMO'ing on every trade you don't take? - I can't make this up by the way."|0.69|7|0|7

I did this with no margin and ended up with 100% return through the covid years. This gave me confidence to be more bold with my investments. After graduating I decided to dedicate more time to learn about stocks. I still stuck with 0% margins and still followed my standard procedure when doing due diligence. I evaluated a company’s balance sheets, determined whether a company is undervalued or overvalued as I moved away from tech stocks and allowed myself to dip into other industries. I believe I had became pretty good at it. I invested in companies like AUPH at $11 and cashed out most of my stocks at ~$25. I bought into NET at $50 which Im still holding and still green on. However, recently BBBY soared up to the 20s. I read what the redditors over at WSB were saying and decided to throw in 15% of my equity into a position at X5 margins into BBBY. Today, the stock has dipped so much that I believe I am going to have to pay off my BBBY position with other positions in my portfolio. 

I think I have learned a valuable lesson today.

# The Technicals

2022's first half was the worst half to a stock market year in the last 52 years. This saw the S&amp;P 500 move down from 4,818.62 to 3,636.87. This is a range of 1,181.75. Of this range, an ideal fibonacci retracement (bear market short-term rally) would be 61.8% back up in this range. That takes us 730.32 up from 3,636.87 which gives 4,367.19. Yesterday's high was 4,325.28. This high was within 1% error of the ideal 61.8% Fibonacci retracement.

Thus, the 50 Week Simple Moving Average of the S&amp;P500, as a further catalyst for resistance, will reject the S&amp;P500 down, thereby allowing for the horrible stock market downturn to continue.

# 1929-crash-like Margin Deleveraging

[FINRA Margin Statistics](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics) has been updated to include July. As expected, we got a slight reprieve in debit balances in customers' margin accounts. Nevertheless, graphing the data and adjusting for the near-record inflation for each data point, we can see that we are still in the worst bubble by value in the history of the stock market.

Fibonacci of this graph shows that Margin has to collapse up to $370 Billion more from August's expected margin value), depending on the strength and speed of the deleveraging.

FINRA Margin Totals, Adjusted for Month-by-Month Inflation. Dotcom crash (left bubble), 2008-2009 crash and great recession (middle bubble) and the current bubble (right). Fibonacci retracement values are listed for 61.8% and 78.6% of each deleveraging period. One can observe that the bottom of margin deleveraging bottoms within that range, depending on the strength and speed of the unwinding. (61.8% seems to correspond to slow and weak, and 78.6% seems to correspond to fast and strong). The data shows that the market will continue to deleverage and crash

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR:

Unfortunately, summer is ending. The short-term rally has expired, as technicals show three problems for the stock market: 1: A perfect rejection off the S&amp;P500's 50 week Simple Moving Average, 2. The 61.8% retracement already happened, and 3. A perfect rejection off the S&amp;P500's 200 day Simple Moving Average. In a 1929-like scenario, total margin (and adjusted for inflation) shows that we are still in the largest margin bubble of all time. Fibonacci levels on the inflation-adjusted FINRA margin data show that the market has to still undergo up to $370 Billion of deleveraging. Therefore, I am hereby predicting that the fall and winter months of 2022 will be some of the worst months in stock market history. Leading market strategists such as Dimon, Zuckerberg, Musk, Novogratz, and even Warren Buffett concur, and some say that 2023 will be a Depression. Will 2022's crash lead us into 'the greatest depression,' and do you think Warren Buffett will die \[either because of or\] during this crash/depression?

Considering that the 30 year old media show Reliable Sources drew huge viewership regularly and was one of the top ranked media news shows, will the cancellation of the show and the 56 year old's departure impact revenue and negatively reflect on the EPS forecasts? I think this is a big loss for WBD. I would venture to guess that loyal viewers will probably cancel their subscription in light of this sudden loss of this media giant from the media giant.

Sinopec and PetroChina have recently de-listed their stocks on the NYSE. 

CNOOC voluntarily delisted from both the NYSE and TSX in December of 2021

A leaked source this past April claims that CNOOC is planning on divesting their North American and UK assets to avoid sanctions as US/China relations are increasingly strained.  

All three companies are state owned and appear to be following the same path.  Perhaps this is connecting dots that aren't there, but does a large internationally company choosing to delist from the exchange in the same country they operate in foreshadow upcoming asset sales?

[Qualcomm Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/QCOM:US) is taking another run at the market for server processors, according to people familiar with its plans, betting it can tap a fast-growing industry and decrease its reliance on smartphones.

The company is seeking customers for a product stemming from last year’s purchase of chip startup Nuvia, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. [Amazon.com Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AMZN:US)’s AWS business, one of the biggest server chip buyers, has agreed to take a look at Qualcomm’s offerings, they said.

Representatives for Qualcomm and Amazon declined to comment. 

Qualcomm gained as much as 2.9% to $152.91 in New York trading after Bloomberg reported the news. The shares had been down 19% this year through Wednesday, part of a broader slide for chip stocks. 

Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon is trying to turn Qualcomm into a broader provider of semiconductors, rather than just the top maker of smartphone chips. But an earlier push into the server market was abandoned four years ago under his predecessor. At the time, the company was trying to cut costs and placate investors after fending off a hostile takeover by [Broadcom Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AVGO:US)

This time around, Qualcomm has Nuvia, staffed with chip designers from companies such as [Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US) Amon, who acquired the business for about $1.4 billion in 2021, has said that its work will help revitalize Qualcomm’s high-end offerings for smartphones. But Nuvia was founded as a provider of technology for the server industry.

The market for cloud computing infrastructure -- the kind of equipment that Amazon, Google and Microsoft Corp. use to whisk data around the world -- generated $73.9 billion last year, according to [research firm IDC](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48998722). That was up 8.8% from 2020. 

The owners of giant cloud data centers have long relied on Intel Corp.’s chip technology for their servers. But they’re increasingly embracing processors that use designs from [Arm Ltd.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2243469Z:LN), a key partner in phone chips for San Diego-based Qualcomm.

Arm designs are already dominant in mobile phones, where they’re prized for not draining battery life. Now power consumption has become a more pressing issue in the data center world as well. As server farms spread -- and suck up staggering amounts of electricity -- companies want more efficient chips.

Amazon has addressed this need by building its own chips based on Arm designs. The e-commerce giant has created multiple generations of its Graviton processor line and touts its performance to customers.

But Amazon also still uses chips from [Intel](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/INTC:US), [Advanced Micro Devices Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AMD:US) and [Nvidia Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NVDA:US) \-- and Qualcomm sees an opportunity to carve out a niche among those suppliers.

The last time it made such an attempt was 2017, when Qualcomm began selling an Arm-based server chip called the Centriq 2400. It relied on [Samsung Electronics Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/005930:KS) to manufacture the products and said they outperformed Intel’s Xeon processors in energy efficiency and cost. At the public introduction of the server chip line in November of that year, potential customers such as [Microsoft](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US) took to the stage to voice their interest in the offering.

But less than a year later, the company’s leadership began shuttering the project. Former Intel executive Anand Chandrasekher, who had led the effort, left Qualcomm.

For Intel, Qualcomm’s latest move would bring yet more competition to an industry it once dominated. The company has been racing to bolster its technology and manufacturing after losing market share to AMD and homegrown chips like Amazon’s.

For Qualcomm, a successful push into server chips would mean it has a much bigger-ticket item to sell. The company’s phone offerings are typically priced in the tens of dollars. Server processors can cost hundreds of dollars."|0.92|38|0|38

It's been a long time coming but Intel may finally be breaking into the US market with its Arc graphics cards. The ASRock Arc A380 is now available for backorder on retailer Newegg's website with an expected ETA date of August 22.

Though with Newegg only asking $140 for the ASRock A380, it's not an abhorrent offer next to inflated prices for the ageing GTX 1650. While the AMD RX 6400 is a better, more recent graphics card at the same price, at least the A380 is somewhat comparatively priced at the low-end. It's also another entry-level graphics card in a somewhat uninspired market for budget GPUs today and could have some knock-on impact on the prices of AMD and Nvidia's offerings."|0.87|79|0|79

t3_wrlplk|1660834670|stocks|A Guide for Predicting (estimating) Macro-economic Events and Individual Price Action|"What are your thoughts on making projections, predictions or estimates? Do you think it is a good learning tool to determine if one's logic or analytical framework is correct/accurate? To what degree should one invest based on predictions?

“The ability to somewhat accurately predict (or rather project/estimate) future events, be it macro or microeconomic, is a powerful tool for any active investor or businessperson. However, this “predictive capacity” should not be conflated with blatant speculation or an attempt at such. Indeed, several things cannot be predicted to any level of accuracy, and therefore it should not be attempted if one is keen on retaining one’s capital (on the presumption of making risky decisions on these predictions). A so-called prediction is more of a realization of what has already happened and what that must mean. The “what it must mean” is often inefficiently recognized by markets, allowing you to make significant profits. Or it may simply grant a de-risking opportunity.  

Common sense 

All that is required to predict future movements are three things. Common sense (1), a deep understanding of the topic at hand (2), and pattern recognition skills (3). When these three are coupled, it can allow you to spot opportunities that the markets have not yet realized. Here, it is apparent the expression, “the markets are efficient” or “the markets are smarter than you” is not necessarily the case. That said, when comparing this, to a long-term strategy taken by, say, Warren Buffet, which is significantly less risky (long term) on a statistical basis, recognition must be made that most will never be able to achieve the level of analytical prowess that is required to consistently beat the markets, for several reasons, including (generally) a massive time commitment. Being wrong is probable, as a regression to speculation often materializes. 

Why is this? Because people are impatient, and fail to wait for a clear opportunity, instead making themselves blind to the gaps in their premature thesis or argument. If this tragic mistake is made, the theory is but mere speculation.”

# [Stock futures tick higher as Wall Street tries to resume rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock market futures were slightly higher Thursday as investors tried to regain their footing a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped a five-day winning streak and a recent market rally appeared to fade.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow were 39 points higher, or 0.11%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.16% along with Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the Dow fell roughly 172 points, or 0.5%. The S&amp;P 500 declined 0.7% for its first negative session in four. The Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.25%. The tech-heavy index and S&amp;P 500 are now both on track to snap a four-week winning streak.
*****
&gt; Those moves came as traders parsed through the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting. The central bank remains committed to fighting inflation, but indicated it could adjust its pace of tightening based on market conditions.
*****
&gt; Investors have been hoping that the Fed might slow the pace of its rate hikes after July’s consumer price index reading showed inflation cooling slightly. But not everyone is convinced.
*****
&gt; “We’re in the camp that the Fed is not going to pivot,” Scott Wren, senior global market strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “The minutes didn’t make us change our mind at all. We think a 75 basis point hike is likely in September, and we’ll see more hikes at the end of the year ... we think the market is a little lofty right here,” he added.
*****
&gt; The latest batch of earnings report didn’t help traders’ sentiment during Wednesday’s session. Target’s quarter missed estimates, with results from Lowe’s coming in mixed.
*****
&gt; Some key economic data will also be released Thursday, including weekly jobless claims and existing home sales.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials saw ""little evidence"" late last month that U.S. inflation pressures were easing, and steeled themselves to force the economy to slow down as much as needed to control the surge in prices, according to the minutes of their July 26-27 policy meeting.

While not explicitly hinting at a particular pace of coming rate increases, beginning with the Sept. 20-21 meeting, the minutes released on Wednesday showed policymakers committed to raising rates as high as necessary to bring inflation under control, and acknowledging that they would have to engineer less spending and lower overall growth for that to happen.

As of the July meeting, Fed officials noted that while some parts of the economy, notably housing, had begun to slow under the weight of tighter credit conditions, the labor market remained strong and unemployment was at a near-record low.

On the metric that mattered most, however, Fed officials at least as of late July had registered little progress.

""Participants agreed that there was little evidence to date that inflation pressures were subsiding,"" the minutes said. Though some inflation reduction might come through improving global supply chains or drops in the prices of fuel and other commodities, some of the heavy lifting would also have to come by imposing higher borrowing costs on households and businesses.

""Participants emphasized that a slowing in aggregate demand would play an important role in reducing inflation pressures,"" the minutes said.

The pace of future hikes would depend, the minutes said, on incoming economic data, as well as Fed assessments of how the economy was adapting to the higher rates already approved.

Some participants said they felt rates would have to reach a ""sufficiently restrictive level"" and remain there for ""some time"" in order to control inflation, which is running at a four-decade high.

In a glimpse of the emerging debate at the central bank, ""many"" participants also noted a risk that the Fed ""could tighten the stance of policy by more than necessary to restore price stability,"" a fact that they said made sensitivity to incoming data all the more important. \[nL1N2ZS1FQ\]

After the release of the minutes, traders of futures tied to the Fed's policy rate saw a half-percentage-point rate hike as more likely in September, with fed funds futures prices reflecting just a 40% chance of a 75-basis-point increase.

INCOMING DATA

The Fed has lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate by 225 points this year to a target range of 2.25% to 2.50%. The central bank is widely expected to hike rates next month https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/FED/lgpdwawwzvo/index.html by either 50 or 75 basis points.

For the Fed to scale back its rate hikes, inflation reports due to be released before the next meeting would likely need to confirm that the pace of price increases was declining.

Data since the Fed's July policy meeting showed annual consumer inflation eased that month to 8.5% from 9.1% in June, a fact that would argue for the smaller 50-basis-point rate increase next month.

But other data released on Wednesday showed why that remains an open question.

Core U.S. retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were stronger than expected in July. That data, along with the shock-value headline that inflation had passed the 10% mark in the United Kingdom, seemed to prompt investors in futures tied to the Fed's target policy interest rate to shift bets in favor of a 75-basis-point rate hike next month.

Meanwhile, a Chicago Fed index of credit, leverage and risk metrics showed continued easing. That poses a dilemma for policymakers who feel that tighter financial conditions are needed to curb inflation.

Job and wage growth in July exceeded expectations, and a recent stock market rally may show an economy still too ""hot"" for the Fed's comfort.

Also, it is run by S&amp;P, so a much lower probability of some fraud or mismanagement of funds.

They just want your $|"I’m a long term investor, two years ago I made the novice mistake of scheduling an appointment with a wealth advisor. I knew nothing about investing, and this is obviously something she recognized and took advantage of. I opened up a Roth IRA and a taxable account with them, I had no clue what I even had. It was whatever she picked, lots of various ETF’s/bonds etc. 

I was being charged 0.35% per quarter, the balance quietly being taken out each quarter. 

Thanks to subs like this and r/Bogleheads, I found out I was being ripped off big time. 

I was being charged an outrageous amount for something I didn’t need. 

I promptly emailed my advisor and asked if negotiation was possible, as I was concerned about the fee adding up long term. I was told “no”, just wow…how greedy can you be?

I made an account with Schwab and transferred my investments over. I then sold everything and bought VT. 

Schwab’s customer service is wonderful


Just a reminder to not make the mistake I made! Luckily I only had about a year of that mistake, compared to 30.


Obviously you have to be cautious when listening to anyone online, but if you’re a young, long term investor…a low cost well known ETF really is hard to beat. Pick something like VTI or VT and call it a day. Schwab, Vanguard, TD Ameritrade are some of the reputable  ones to go with  

People can have their little debates about international or US only but I mean as long as you’re picking something low cost then you’re good.

LATER IN LIFE ,then it gets more complex. As far as bonds etc.

Initial results from a handful of test cases shows 3M would be swamped by losses should the more than 230,000 lawsuits related to the company’s military earplugs business go forward, the plaintiff’s adviser J.B. Heaton testified in bankruptcy court Tuesday.

“It is more and more likely within the next several years we’ll see a 3M bankruptcy, yes,” Heaton told US Bankruptcy Judge Jeffrey J. Graham during a hearing in federal court in Indianapolis.

“We strongly disagree with this unsupported and clearly flawed speculation,” company communications manager Sean Lynch said in an emailed statement. “3M has committed to provide $1 billion to a trust for claimants determined to be entitled to compensation.”

Some advocates for the suing soldiers want Graham to block 3M from paying any shareholder dividends, buying back any of its stock or spinning off any assets, if the judge also decides to halt the lawsuits.

Restricting how 3M spends its cash will protect money and other assets that could be used to compensate soldiers who have had their hearing damaged by the earplugs, the advocates said in court papers.

The company has a paid shareholders a regular dividend for at least a decade. Currently the quarterly payment is $1.49 per share.

Company lawyers disputed Heaton’s findings during the hearing, arguing that the 19 cases in which juries returned verdicts are outliers and cannot be used to extrapolate results for the other cases. Heaton, a former trial lawyer who now studies corporate litigation, acknowledged that the sample is small and that a judge may conclude $100 billion is not realistic.

3M is in federal court trying to convince Graham to halt the lawsuits while the company’s earplugs subsidiary reorganizes in bankruptcy.

Last month, the company put its Aearo Technologies unit into bankruptcy in Indianapolis as a way to resolve the claims. Under Chapter 11 rules, Aearo is automatically entitled to freeze lawsuits it faces, but because 3M itself didn’t file bankruptcy a judge must agree to give the industrial conglomerate the same protection.

The bankruptcy is Aearo Technologies LLC, 22-02890, United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis).

t3_wq9vpj|1660694695|stocks|Your Thoughts on Moderna ($MRNA)???|"Moderna currently has a PE of 5.4, they made $4.7 billion last quarter (beating estimates of $4 billion), they have $21 billion in advance purchase agreements for Covid vaccines in 2022, they have \~$18 billion in cash to $650 million in debt, they have a current net profit margin of \~52%, they have a highly effective vax that has now been approved by the FDA for children......aaaaaannnnnd they have no other products besides their SPIKEVAX.  Murky waters?  

Obviously a huge part of the buy thesis rests on how pervasive Covid continues to be and the need/demand for future boosters.  I personally think Covid won't go away and we will continue to need Moderna's vaccine booster into the future.  Remember, their product is one of the most effective and also isn't as challenging from a storage/shipping/administration standpoint as the competitors.  However, with 67% of the US population already vaccinated, I don't think it's likely that the deniers/unvaxxed are likely to jump on Moderna's product in the future. What does this mean for the longer-term profitability of the SPIKEVAX and can the market grow?  

The next buy argument is that Moderna has proven the efficacy and potential of MRNA vaccines. Moderna is positioned to use their industry leading knowledge (and $18 billion cash pile) to develop new vaccines for other maladies.  Currently $MRNA has Phase Three vaccine trials underway for cytomegalovirus (CMV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the flu.  Any one of these gaining approval would be a huge boon for profits and for the stock price.  Phase 3 Trials typically take 1-4 years and how likely one (or all) of these trials are to hit is beyond me.

The bear case is pretty obvious.  Moderna is a one-hit wonder and their only product may be running out of disease to treat.  While MRNA vaccines were effective for Covid, they haven't (yet) proven to be successful for anything else.  It's a value trap and Moderna may not be able to create any future vaccines.

Personally, I lean more towards the bull case.  I think MRNA vaccines are a huge leap forward in medical technology and I have faith that Moderna is well positioned to profit off of this medical revolution.  With that said, I'm a newbie on biotech stocks, I don't currently have a position in $MRNA, and I'd love to hear from folks more knowledgable than me.  Thanks all!"|0.81|43|0|43

It is focused on being very good on specific tasks, the public will never hold the tech in their hands.

Warning: I have a more than basic computer understanding lol. 

Optical Computing on the other part, seems like the logical step towards the new generation of computing power. 

It basically works by using light (photons) as a means of data transfer instead of using electrons.

It could revolutionize memory, data transfer, and processing power: 

If successful, this technology could enable Terabytes per second transfers speeds as opposed as our current 100Gb/s (actual) max speed. 

As for the memory, Optical Ram might come into play. 
We’re talking 30 times faster than SRAM and a 1000 times faster than DRAM. 

And our CPUs could be literally as fast as light itself. 

It could largely reduce the production costs of hardware since we would use much less materials for a much greater transfer capacity.

t3_wq63n0|1660685102|stocks|Philosophy of Trading (vs. Investing)|"I've been active in stocks for about 6 years, and I've tried to corral the things I wish someone had told me when I first started out. There's information about how stocks work and why they work, but in terms of philosophy, I feel like there's a general lack.

Someone once explained market movements to me as ""stochastic"" (re: random), and I think that description sets up every potential new investor/trader for failure. **No, the market is not a random lottery and it is not unpredictable. There are always, always bellwethers to be mindful of, and most of them never show up on finance sites, subs, etc**. That said, you do not need to be a Moneyball-esque guru to get things right either. Just be aware of the world around you. Absorb as much as you can.

Figuring out a good strategy means acknowledging that (the value of general awareness) and knowing the difference between investing and trading - the philosophical difference.

**Investing** in a company is like the ultimate upvote button. You're literally committing money as a loan to a company that you want to continue to exist. Yes, you can invest in things that you feel will have a good ROI years down the road, but if that's what your main goal is, just index. Buying index funds is like betting the market won't explode in 10-20-30 years. I almost wouldn't call index funds investing. Generally, folks who index just asked ""what's a safe bet?"" and some finance person said ""index funds"" (in other words, it's just trading). Investing is more emotional in my opinion. If the stock goes down, you're willing to eat that as a premium for supporting a company you believe in - or just really like.

**Trading** (and I know I'll catch some flack here) has nothing to do with understanding the actual value of a company or how you personally feel about it. You just have to know two things:

* where pervading sentiment is *wrong*
* when the market will *likely* figure out there's a blind spot

Knowing one is not enough - you need both in order to be successful.

Every fundamentals-focused trade I ever made blew up in my face. The only way to win on fundamentals is to a) be an insider, or b) have a time machine. It's a false game for new traders to play because fundamentals are almost always already priced in.

What is not priced in is sociology. Read the room. When is the general tenor of discussion moving ass-backwards from reality? Squeeze plays like we've seen with GME and BBBY come from the acknowledgment of one simple idea - these companies are *not* going out of business. The market was pricing them as if they were, and you know the rest.

Now, some folks on the GME side would say fundamentals were the catalyst, but that's less-than-half of the story. It was really Ryan Cohen. It was an almost unanimous *social* acceptance that his name brought legitimacy to the company's potential rebound. Nothing on a spreadsheet could have predicted the impact he would have - before he even *did* anything! And the same is happening for BBBY. Ryan Cohen is the common denominator.

Find moments like this where your gut tells you the market isn't seeing reality clearly, then time your position with when you think sentiments will change. In other words, yes, YOU CAN TIME THE MARKET (god I hate that adage). Timing the market is a *must* if you're going to trade actively. It's literally why options exist.

Anyways, that's my two cents to myself 6 years ago. Interested to see what you folks think."|0.7|24|0|24

TMUS has done really well, I don’t know exactly why it has done so well actually.

Nevertheless, It came to my mind that ISPs are generally moving towards wireless connectivity in the US because it’s cheaper and easier to maintain. In ten years from now, we will probably have new standards that are even more reliable then 4G, 5G, 6G etc. From consumer perspective, most people will prefer wireless because they can reach similar or higher bandwidth for the same price, probably without sacrificing reliability in the future. 

Now I thought about Mr. Musk and his Starlink. With satelite powered internet you have basically the same benefits with even higher speed, however, the hardware is more expensive. Over the years it will get cheaper and cheaper to a point where I think that many people will prefer using Starlink over traditional wireless connectivity.

The problem for SOBA, VZ, and TMUS is that they cannot simply launch tons of satelites into the space to compete with Starlink, however, Starlink could easily buy bands and create base stations that use their satelite network to provide wireless connectivity.

An economist known for his bearish tendencies is warning Americans that a recession will be ""long"" and ""severe"". Nouriel Roubini, also referred to as ""Dr. Doom,"" said Monday that a recession could bring financial distress ""across the board."" 

Despite a strong jobs report, the U.S. economy has left many Americans seeing higher grocery bills despite a dip in July in overall inflation. The Federal Reserve has attempted to curb inflation by raising interest rates, but some experts say the country is heading for, or may already be in a recession. 

 ""We are in a sharp slowdown, we've had two negative quarters of growth in the first half \[of 2022\],"" Roubini, an Iranian American economist who accurately predicted the housing bubble burst in 2008, told Bloomberg on Monday. ""The recession is going to be long, protracted, severe, and associated with financial distress across the board.""

The Federal Reserve most recently hiked interest rates another 75 basis points in late July to thwart an inflation rate of 8.5 percent, which followed a similar raise in June—marking the largest back-to-back increases seen in decades. Roubini implied the increases aren't enough to combat inflation.

In fact, Roubini expects the Fed will need to hike interest rates further to bring the 8.5 percent inflation rate to the target 2 percent.

""The Fed funds rate should be going well above 4 percent to push inflation towards 2 percent,"" he said to Bloomberg. ""If that doesn't happen, inflation expectations are going to get unhinged, or you'll get a hard landing.""

Yet despite the growing concern regarding a recession, the Fed's interest rates are still relatively low.

According to an article by Bankrate, although the Fed has been raising interest rates, its borrowing rate is still historically low. The federal funds rate has remained below its historic average of 4.61 percent since 2007. From 2008 to 2015, the federal funds rate was zero.

The federal funds rate reached its highest point in the early 1980s, when it soared to 20 percent.

Roubini said he felt although inflation may have peaked, he's unsure of how fast it may fall.

""I don't think the monetary policy is tight enough to push inflation to 2 percent fast enough,"" he said.

During the last week of July, an editing war broke out on the Wikipedia page for ""recession"" after Biden administration officials played down figures showing the United States had entered an unofficial recession following two quarters of negative economic growth. Two consecutive quarters of decreasing GDP is an unofficial definition for a recession."|0.46|0|0|0

t3_wpyunx|1660667602|stocks|Home Depot posts record revenue and profit, beating Q2 expectations and sticking to guidance; stock up 5%|"[Home Depot](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HD) on Tuesday reported higher second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ expectations as the company cited continued strength in demand for home improvement projects.

The Atlanta-based company stood by its forecast for total and comparable sales to grow about 3% for the year, with comparable sales to be slower in the second half of the year. 

Same store sales rose 5.8% in the quarter, topping analyst expectations for growth of 4.9%, according to FactSet. Home Depot said transactions slipped during the period, while the average ticket rose, primarily as a result of inflation.

&amp;#x200B;

* Earnings per share: $5.05 vs. $4.94 expected
* Revenue: $43.79 billion vs. $43.36 billion expected

Home Depot continued its streak of beating analyst forecasts with record quarterly results for Q2. The home improvement retailer has topped quarterly earnings estimates since the first quarter of 2020, and hasn't missed revenue predictions since Q3 2019. Home Depot stock is down about 25% for the year, and its shares are up about 5% in morning trading.

The second quarter is seasonally the strongest for wholesale building retailers as home projects pick up in the summer months. Wall Street predicts moderate earnings growth for the two companies. But analysts note concerns over a weakening macro backdrop, slowing ""do-it-yourself"" demand and general retail weakness."|0.94|292|0|292

As a result, in recent years, and as I’ve started to make more money, I’m primarily in VGT (NASDAQ tracking), SPLG/SPY (S&amp;P500 tracking), and DIA (Dow Jones tracking). 

My weighting is roughly as follows: 

60% tech 

20% S&amp;P500

10% Dow Jones 

10% other ETFs / a couple small holdings

My question is, what is the risk of well known ETFs liquidating? 

For example, I noticed SPY has been around since the mid 90s, whereas SPLG has only been around since the mid 2000s. 

The underlying holdings are basically the same. Younger ETFs shouldn’t be a cause for concern right? 

Maybe it’s a dumb question but I just got to thinking about the risk of liquidation. I’m perfectly happy holding through the ups and downs though.

# [Dow futures are little changed as traders weigh retail earnings, Walmart up 3%](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/15/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were little changed Tuesday as traders weighed the earnings reports from two key retailers.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down just 6 points, or 0.02%. S&amp;P 500 futures slipped 0.6% along with Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
&gt; Walmart reported earnings per share that beat analyst expectations, sending the stock up 3%. The company also stuck with its second-half outlook. Home Depot reported earlier in the morning, with earnings beating expectations and the home-improvement store maintaining its 2022 guidance. Target and Lowe’s will report quarterly results Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, shares of ZipRecruiter slipped more than 5% after the company lowered its revenue outlook.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a solid session, with the major averages all rising Monday after a sharp intraday turnaround. The move higher built on the market’s rally off a June low.
*****
&gt; Still, some see the recent gains as a bear market rally instead of the start of a new bull cycle.
*****
&gt; “I think people are not being sensitive enough to this economic slowdown and what it’s going to mean for corporate earnings and profit margins,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said on CNBC’s “Fast Money.”

Key elements of the exchange offer include:

* 3M stockholders have the option to exchange some, all or none of their shares of 3M common stock for shares of common stock of SpinCo, subject to proration as described below. Shares of SpinCo common stock will convert automatically into the right to receive shares of Neogen common stock at the closing of the Merger, which is expected to occur promptly after completion of the exchange offer.
* Tendering 3M stockholders are expected to receive approximately $107.53 of Neogen common stock for every $100.00 of shares of 3M common stock tendered and accepted in the exchange offer, subject to the upper limit described below.
* 3M will determine the prices at which shares of 3M common stock and shares of SpinCo common stock (and ultimately shares of Neogen common stock) will be exchanged by reference to the simple arithmetic average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of shares of 3M common stock on the New York Stock Exchange and shares of Neogen common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on each of the last three full trading days ending on and including the second full trading day prior to the expiration date of the exchange offer (which are currently expected to be August 25, August 26 and August 29, 2022).
* 3M currently expects that approximately 108.3 million shares of SpinCo common stock will be available in the exchange offer, with the final number dependent on the number of outstanding shares of Neogen common stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger. The number of shares of 3M common stock that will be accepted in the exchange offer will depend on the final exchange ratio, the number of shares of SpinCo common stock offered and the number of shares of 3M common stock tendered.  Based on recent trading prices of shares of 3M common stock and Neogen common stock, and assuming the issuance of 108.3 million shares of SpinCo common stock, if the exchange offer were fully subscribed, approximately 15.7 million shares of 3M common stock would be accepted for exchange in the exchange offer.
* The exchange offer and withdrawal rights are scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on August 31, 2022, unless the exchange offer is extended or terminated.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Alternatively, if somebody sells a put to the market makers, assuming the contract is going to expire worthless, they would have a bullish or neutral sentiment. However, the contract gets counted in the put category driving the P/C ration higher showing a bearish sentiment.

t3_wpetrh|1660607336|stocks|We’re not in a bubble|"Just my humble opinion obviously. Here’s why:

I’ve seen a lot of people, including a couple of big names comparing the current market to the 1930’s and the dot com era. In my opinion the state of the market is nothing like this. 

During the Great Depression people were way over leveraged, which is what essentially caused the crash, similar to the housing bubble that burst in 2007. Too much borrowing caused a bubble that was not sustainable. Currently margin debt is below average in relation to stock market value. 

During the dot com bubble there was very clear over pricing of stocks, with the nasdaq composite average P/E ratio exceeding 100 for example. Right now the average P/E ratios are nothing out of the ordinary.

Further, despite interlinkage of global markets, the US stock market is arguably strengthened due to the weaker Russian, European, and Chinese markets, resulting in US stocks becoming almost a safe haven which could command higher valuations than average being reasonable. 

There are troubling world events but a lot has been priced in and the stock markets have faced and recovered quickly from similar issues in recent decades. I think the crashes and recoveries of the last 20 years in particular have actually instilled a lot of confidence in the stock market, which has brought it to a new level of maturity (despite memes). This market perception is not easy to quantify or even be aware of. 

People are very aware that markets can crash, which I think is making people overly cautious right now in an undervalued market. At the same time, the markets have withstood many big tests in recent times which they have recovered relatively quickly from, I don’t see the masses logically losing faith in the markets as a whole like in previous major crashes anytime soon. I think we are going to climb a big wall of worry.

I doubt anyone is going to alter their investment decisions based on my opinion, but obviously don’t. Think for yourself. These are simple points but I haven’t seen anyone make much of a logical argument against the whole bubble idea which is why I wanted to share my thoughts. Thanks for reading."|0.33|0|0|0

t3_wpd59m|1660602980|stocks|Tesla valuation multiple is lower than Amazon's despite better growth prospects|"The prevailing ""wisdom"" of this sub is that TSLA is a good business with an overvalued stock. I am here to illustrate that this is not the case - the stock is not overvalued. The primary reason being, you cannot expect to pay the same earnings multiple for companies with a vastly different earnings growth trajectories. So what other company and stock can we compare that is as at the same size as Tesla with very high growth prospects and is widely considered a good business AND a good investment? Amazon!

Over the last 12 months, Tesla's earnings multiple is actually 16% lower than Amazon's, and calculated from 2023 forecasted earnings, Tesla's earnings multiple is still 3% lower than Amazon's. Amazon's earnings forecasts have been too optimistic - Amazon missed analyst estimates 3 out of the last 4 quarters, while Tesla beat analyst estimates every single quarter in the past year. Moreover, Tesla's 2023 earnings forecast has only had upwards revisions (7 of them) in the past month, while Amazon has had 5 upwards revisions and 6 downwards revisions from analysts. Finally, the range between the low and high estimates for Amazon is much wider than the range for Tesla, indicating higher earnings uncertainty. 

&amp;#x200B;

So to sum it up, Tesla is actually less richly valued than Amazon based on current and 2023 earnings multiples, the analysts have consistently underestimated Tesla despite revising earnings estimates up while analysts have consistently overestimated Amazon despite revising earning estimates down, and Tesla earnings are more certain than Amazon's. As a reminder, Tesla has much more room to grow with only 1.5% of the car market compared to Amazon's 40% share of online retail.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, I believe that analysts are way underestimating Tesla earnings potential. Based on my own estimate, I believe Tesla will actually accomplish 2023 earnings of $23.81 per share (compare to analyst consensus of $14.51) by expanding revenue over 50% in 2023 with new factories ramped up in Berlin and Austin, gross margins well in excess of 30% due to economies of scale and manufacturing efficiencies at their new factories as well as near 100% margin software sales, while operating expenses grow slower than revenue growth. If this comes to pass, and investors are willing to pay an Amazon-like earnings multiple for 2023, the stock would be worth 65.98\*$23.81= $1,570, or nearly 70% higher than it is today.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, the trend of analysts underestimating Tesla combined with Tesla's relatively reasonable valuation multiple (as discussed above) could provide a tailwind to the stock over the next 12-16 months and take it to new highs."|0.47|0|0|0

I think differently, so much so I think we will see ATH this fall and possibly hit 5000 by Christmas. Here are the reasons:

1: This “recession” is priced in, and it turns out the cost isn’t that large. Unemployment remains low, and people are buying stuff. The line at Chik fil A is still long as ever, and people still can’t get a PS5 at retail.

2: The Ukraine war isn’t that big of a deal. Support is starting to wane, and oil prices are going down anyway. Eventually the conflict will fade into obscurity. As for the European winter, so what if they have to turn on their coal plants? They will still be itching to buy the next iPhone.

3: Chinese housing crisis isn’t a crisis at all. CCP will simply “fix” the balance sheets like they have the last 20 years, and everything will be alright. It’s worked in the past, it will work in the present. The mighty Chinese economic machine will keep churning

4: Inflation is going down, but even if it didn’t, it’s not a big deal. Companies will just raise their prices, and people will continue to buy at those prices. Corporate profits are at ATH in some sectors. Therefore stocks in those remain high. Do you really want to stay in cash with all that action happening?

5: Despite rising interest rates, they are still at historic lows. Fed will probably stop rising them soon with favorable CPI reports. Likely they will top out at very low levels anyway. Volcker days are gone.

With U.S. stocks briefly sputtering to start the new week, strategists at the research arm of the world’s largest money manager are weighing in with words of caution.

&amp;#x200B;

In a note released on Monday by the BlackRock Investment Institute, they said they expect U.S. company earnings to deteriorate and the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates to a level that will “stall the economic restart,” given persistent inflation that’s likely to settle above pre-COVID levels. They also called the stock market’s rally off the mid-June lows unsustainable.

&amp;#x200B;

Equities were slightly higher at midday Monday, taking back modest loses seen after U.S. data missed forecasts and China’s unexpected signs of slowing growth damped investor sentiment. Financial markets have been shifting back and forth between two narratives — one in which easing inflation and slowing growth give the Fed room to back off aggressive rate hikes, the other in which persistently high price gains coupled with a robust labor market compel policy makers to continue lifting borrowing costs.

&amp;#x200B;

July’s downside surprise in the consumer-price index gave equities a boost and helped send the S&amp;P 500 SPX, 0.40% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, 0.62% to their fourth straight week of gains on Friday. The S&amp;P 500 has surged more than 16% from its June low and retraced more than 50% of its bear-market drop.

&amp;#x200B;

Read: Inflation surge cools in July. Should you still play defense with your portfolio?

&amp;#x200B;

“We don’t think the equity bounce is worth chasing,” said strategists Wei Li, Beata Harasim and Tara Sharma, along with BlackRock Investment Institute’s Deputy Head Alex Brazier. “We believe the Fed will remain susceptible to ‘the politics of inflation,’ a chorus of voices demanding it tame inflation. Our bottom line: The latest inflation reading isn’t enough to spur the Fed pivot we’ve been waiting for to lean back into stocks.”

&amp;#x200B;

What’s more, they said, consumer spending is in the process of shifting toward services and away from goods, the category which benefited from the stay-at-home stage of the pandemic. That shift “could hit stocks,” according to the BlackRock strategists: They note that earnings tied to goods are expected to make up 62% of the S&amp;P 500’s profits this year, versus 38% for services, as shown in the chart below. A boom in services would power the economy more than it would S&amp;P 500 earnings."|0.87|247|0|247

t3_wp8ydm|1660592844|stocks|Reminder to take gains on the way up!|"We've seen a huge rally in stocks over the past 3 weeks.

QQQ is up from its June low of 271 to 333 currently.

SPY pushed from June low of 365 to 429 currently.

Many of the high flying stocks that make up these indexes are up over 50% in that same time period.

Even ARKK has rallied from 36 to 52 in that same timeframe.

&amp;#x200B;

Many other high volatility stocks that were super hot a year ago are slowly recovering. This is a reminder to not get overly excited and start dumping all-in life savings back into the market because of a potential bull market fomo. Don't make the same mistakes of the past.

Don't forget to assess your risk profile and take gains on the way up. There's no harm in selling some shares of a stock that's run up 50%+ in the 2 weeks. You beat the hell out of the market on the long term with that move.

For example, I love ENPH. I plan to hold it long term. But in the past 6 months, it's gone up from $140 to $300. Do I believe that ENPH is the future? Absolutely. But at a P/S of 23 and P/E of 200, it's not a bad idea of selling a small portion (based on your risk appetite) to secure the gains and maybe move it into something more stable while you wait for more information to surface about the market and economy. Maybe I miss out 10% more gains. But if I'm patient, I can move it into a sector that has more value and higher chance to run up than clean-energy. Maybe a stock in a sector that has the chance to run up 100% in 5 months like ENPH did.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, all this is based on your risk profile. No one has a crystal ball, but the only way to get rich on stocks is to actually sell at some point. Maybe selling small amounts of individual shares of fast moving recovering stocks that had great quarters (ie. NET, ENPH, CRWD, AMD) will help free up some capital to buy more of them on the next downturn.

No one can time tops of bottoms, but just remember that taking gains is always a legitimate strategy. Even if the gains are small amounts. Take that money and treat yourself to something nice. Money isn't worth anything if you don't spend it on making your life easier or more enjoyable.

&amp;#x200B;

Burry's Scion Asset Management disclosed just over 500,000 shares of Geo Group worth $3.3 million. Geo invests in private prisons and mental health facilities, and commands a market capitalization of less than $900 million.

Close followers of Burry are likely to interpret his decision to effectively liquidate his portfolio as a bad omen. The hedge fund manager [diagnosed](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-twitter-return-biggest-market-bubble-ever-2021-6-1030524823?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=markets&amp;utm_source=markets&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) the ""greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things"" last summer, and [warned](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/big-short-michael-burry-warns-meme-stocks-crypto-crash-coming-2021-6-1030534935?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=markets&amp;utm_source=markets&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) owners of meme stocks and cryptocurrencies that they were careening towards the ""mother of all crashes.""

More recently, he has [cautioned investors](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-consumer-recession-inflation-stock-market-rally-2022-8?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) not to get too excited about the recent rally in stocks, as previous downturns have seen [lots of temporary rebounds](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-tweets-stock-market-bubble-crash-rallies-2022-5?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) before finding a bottom. He also [warned](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-market-silliness-is-back-2022-8?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) the ""silliness"" in markets during the height of the pandemic has returned, and tweeted over the weekend that he ""can't shake that silly pre-Enron, pre-9/11, pre-WorldCom feeling - referring to the euphoria that preceded the dot-com crash.

Scion's portfolio comprised 11 stocks worth $165 million at the end of March, excluding bearish put options it held against 206,000 Apple shares.

The Scion chief has taken a knife to his portfolio in the past. He pared it from 20 holdings to six in the third quarter of last year, reducing its value from $140 million to $42 million in the space of three months.

t3_wp317p|1660578656|stocks|How can I get my dad to stop day trading?|"My dad is currently addicted to stocks and it seems to be worsening.

I keep telling him to put his money in an index fund but he keeps pulling out his MBA and venture capital classes he took from Georgia tech and tells me to shut up.

Although I tell him statistically most people lose money from day trading he keeps acting like he can beat the market with individual stocks (he says that in the most literal way possible) and He’s going one step further and making a trading bot now. 

I know he’s my dad and I don’t really want to fight him but I’m really worried about him seemingly gambling away his life savings. He is soon going to retire from his data-analytics job.

And although I know that some very talented people make money out of trading bots and stuff but It really is going against traditional knowledge on how to invest as a individual.

Previously posted this on WSB and immediately got a comment to put all the money in bbby. It was fun and all but I’d really like some actual advice

Some additional context: I invest in individual stocks, bonds, and etfs. 
I am a minor and a highschooler.
My investments total around 30000$

I read different stuff like john bogle, peter lynch, graham and etc to stuff on investopia. 

my dad is a data scientist who works as a r&amp;d researcher or whatever.
He has a portfolio of like 300,000.

Another edit:
He is a investor that often swings stocks
(What I was referring to the “day trading”)

He has stuff like TSLA and google and 3M 
And lots of dividend stocks I recommended.
I just can’t get him to bury the idea of actually making a day trading bot and swing trading. 

My portfolio is 70% stocks (etfs, reits, blue chips, dividend sfocks) and 30% bonds. (Corporate&amp;treasury)


To be a little more clear:
He’s not retiring with 300k. He has real estate and if I recall correctly he has more in cash to what he has in stocks. His future plan is to expand the stock portfolio.


Lol you guys are kidding me right?
You keep asking me for his returns
He’s up 1% this year. So?
He got hit by the crash and bought the dip
That doesn’t mean he’s capable of making long term returns 😂

Who cares if he made money or not his logic is still flawed

I literally had some dude post this on r/Gatech saying this is likely satire. I swear to god this is real. Why tf do you guys not take this seriously? This is a real problem to me

I told my dad, he instantly downloaded reddit, and is currently going on a rampage to actually find this page. Thank you for all your kind opinions (sarcasm) and have a good day!"|0.69|1120|0|1120

Economists had expected a reading of 5.0, according to a survey by The Wall Street Journal. Any reading below zero indicates deteriorating conditions.

**Key details:** The index for new orders dropped 35.8 points to negative 29.6 in August. The shipments index fell 49.4 points to negative 24.1. Unfilled orders fell for the third straight month. Labor market conditions weakened. The prices-paid index fell 9 points to 55.5, its lowest level in over a year. In addition, manufacturers were not optimistic about the six-month outlook.

**Big picture:** Economists were expecting a small retreat in the factory index, not a rout. The U.S. manufacturing sector, which was a strength during the recovery from the pandemic, is facing a steep drop-off in new business. The New York data, and a similar reading from the Philadelphia Fed, are seen as early indicators for the health of the factory sector in August. The closely-watched Institute for Supply Management’s barometer of American factories fell to a two-year low of 52.8% in July.

**What are they saying?** “We caution to not take too much away from this report as it likely paints an excessively downbeat picture of manufacturing. We look for a soft economic rebound in the second half of 2022 to keep manufacturing growing in a low gear,” said Oren Klachkin, economist at Oxford Economics.

Households, not hedge funds or major corporations, represent the biggest class of owners of the U.S. stock market.

That matters because households, the “placid gorilla” in U.S. stocks, haven’t cut and run despite this year’s sharp selloff, which means stocks haven’t hit a bottom yet, according to a BofA Global.

Collectively, households hold about $38 trillion in equity assets (see chart) through stocks, retail mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, $5.9 trillion of which was added over the last two years, according to a tally from BofA Global.

U.S. households now own roughly 52% of the stock market. And a look at three major market plunges since 2000 (see chart) shows that equities only bottomed a few quarters after significant selling activity from households occurred.

BofA’s research investment team said a common refrain from July investor meetings was: “Everybody’s already bearish, might as well buy.” But they still favor cash, credit, and equities, in that order. Or at least until households, the “decision-maker,” decides to make a move and sell.

U.S. stocks were higher Friday and heading for strong weekly gains in the days after U.S. inflation data for July showed signs of slowing price gains. The S&amp;P 500 index was trading above the key 4,200 mark, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reclaimed the 33,000 level and the Nasdaq Composite Index was higher after officially exiting a bear market midweek."|0.78|75|0|75

The unsolicited offer was made last week on the same day as Unity's Q2 earnings where management acknowledged the offer, but refused to comment further upon it.  


Unity closed last week at $58.49 per share, just a few shares off the proposed $58.85 AppLovin had offered in the deal. As Unity is the larger of the two companies, the deal would in actuality have been a merger with AppLovin as the lesser part of the new entity, and Unity CEO Riccitiello staying as CEO.  


The deal was not well received by shareholders of Unity, but interestingly it was dependent on the cancelation of Unity's plans of merging with AppLovin competitor ironSource (IS).   


The ironSource merger has also received its fair share of criticism, but in my opinion, AppLovin's offer made it out to seem stronger, as the move came off as a desperate one over worries of a combined Unity and ironSource.

# [Stock futures fall on slowing China economy concern, following 4 straight weeks of S&amp;P gains](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/14/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. equity futures were lower Monday, putting Wall Street on track to take a breather after another positive week, as traders braced for big retail earnings.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 149 points, or 0.44%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.5% each.
*****
&gt; Monday’s moves come after disappointing economic data out of China overnight. The country’s central bank also cut rates unexpectedly, raising concern over China’s economic recovery.
*****
&gt; “The clouds of recession are gathering globally. The Chinese economy contracted in 2Q. The US notched a “technical recession.” The flow of natural gas to Western Europe is restricted. In the past three months, we have revised down our forecast for global growth to 2.5%Y in 2022, which is about 50bp below consensus and 40bp lower than in May. We are edging closer to the bear scenario from our May Mid-year Outlook,” wrote Morgan Stanley’s Seth Carpenter in a note to clients Sunday.
*****
&gt; Last week the S&amp;P 500 advanced 3.25% to notch its fourth positive week in a row and its longest winning streak since 2021. The Nasdaq Composite ended the week 3.08% higher, also for its fourth straight week. The Dow added 2.9%.
*****
&gt; The gains came after economic data showed inflation pressures could be easing a bit. The consumer price index was flat from June to July, the producer price index showed a surprise decline and import prices fell more than expected.
*****
&gt; That helped relax investors that have been eager to call the mid-June lows the bottom of the cycle. Just as many have been quick to call out that the data from one month doesn’t necessarily make it a reliable trend.
*****
&gt; Investors are looking ahead to a week of earnings from big retailers including Home Depot, Walmart and Target, and listening for clues on how their businesses have been affected by inflation and other macro challenges in the most recent quarter.
*****
&gt; Retail sales data is also scheduled to be released this week.

On Sunday, the Tesla chief executive congratulated the company’s Shanghai “gigafactory” in a tweet: “Congrats Giga Shanghai on making millionth car! Total Teslas made now over 3M.”

The milestone came just a few weeks after Musk said Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif., produced its 2 millionth vehicle. Tesla also has new factories in Austin, Texas, and Berlin, which Musk in June referred to as “money furnaces.” The Shanghai factory opened in 2018, but it has been plagued by temporary shutdowns due to COVID-19 restrictions and parts shortages. In July, Tesla said it delivered nearly 255,000 vehicles in the second quarter, down about 18% from the previous quarter. Still, the electric-auto maker beat Wall Street’s expectations in its second-quarter earnings, defying projections that Shanghai shutdowns would hurt its bottom line. 

When earnings were released, Musk said the company had been in “supply-chain hell for several years,” but barring a surprise, “we have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.” 

In that report, Tesla said the Shanghai factory achieved “the highest vehicle production month in our history” in June. Tesla shares TSLA, +4.68% have rallied 25% over the past month, as it gets set for a 3-for-1 stock split Aug. 24, but they are still down about 15% year to date, compared to the S&amp;P 500’s SPX, +1.73% 10% decline this year."|0.9|548|0|548

As early as last year, we had predictions being made that we will see high inflation this year because of the Fed's quantitative easing post-covid. The All-in podcast's discussion of this topic has been very telling. I am looking for a systemic understanding of factors like the interest rate, inflation rate, commodity prices, employment numbers, consumer confidence etc. Even though I have a finance background, I have only seen standalone explanations for these topics. What I have been unable to find so far is an explanation of the relationships between these factors and their implications for wealth building. Would also be interesting to see how adding the geopolitics layer on this changes things. Unfortunately resources I have seen so far don't explore relationships beyond surface level.

Mostly, I'd say that I don't know what I don't know so any references to useful books or documentaries would be helpful. Shouldn't be too simple (e.g. how increasing interest rates is a contractionary policy that reduces inflation and increases unemployment - that's just Econ 101).

t3_wodx1z|1660503725|stocks|Market jump after Fed rate hike is a ‘trap,’ Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson warns investors|" [Morgan Stanley](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MS) is urging investors to resist putting their money to work in stocks despite the market’s post-Fed-decision jump.

Mike Wilson, the firm’s chief U.S. equity strategist and chief investment officer, said he believes Wall Street’s excitement over [the idea that interest rate hikes may slow sooner than expected](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/fed-decision-july-2022-.html) is premature and problematic.

“The market always rallies once the Fed stops hiking until the recession begins. … \[But\] it’s unlikely there’s going to be much of a gap this time between the end of the Fed hiking campaign and the recession,**″** he told CNBC’s “[Fast Money](https://www.cnbc.com/fast-money/)” on Wednesday. “Ultimately, this will be a trap.”

According to Wilson, the most pressing issues are the effect the economic slowdown will have on corporate earnings and the risk of the Federal Reserve over-tightening.

“The market has been a bit stronger than you would have thought given the growth signals have been consistently negative,” he said. “Even the bond market is now starting to buy into the fact that the Fed is probably going to go too far and drive us into recession.”

## ‘Close to the end’

Wilson has a 3,900 year-end price target on the [S&amp;P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX), one of the lowest on Wall Street. That implies a [3% dip from Wednesday’s close](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/stock-futures-tick-up-ahead-of-key-fed-decision.html) and a 19% drop from the index’s closing high hit in January.

His forecast also includes a call for the market to take another leg lower before getting to the year-end target. Wilson is bracing for the S&amp;P to fall below 3,636, the 52-week low hit last month.

“We’re getting close to the end. I mean this bear market has been going on for a while,” Wilson said. “But the problem is it won’t quit, and we need to have that final move, and I don’t think the June low is the final move.”

Wilson believes the S&amp;P 500 could fall as low as 3,000 in a 2022 recession scenario.

“It’s really important to frame every investment in terms of ‘What is your upside versus your downside,’” he said. “You’re taking a lot of risk here to achieve whatever is left on the table. And, to me, that’s not investing.”

Wilson considers himself [conservatively positioned](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/04/bear-market-rally-setting-stage-for-correction-morgan-stanley-warns.html) — noting he’s underweight stocks and likes defensive plays including [health care](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLV), [REITs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IYR), [consumer staples](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLP) and [utilities](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLU). He also sees the merits of holding extra [cash](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DXY) and [bonds](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y) at the moment.

And, he’s not in a rush to put money to work and has been “hanging out” until there are signs of a trough in stocks.

“We’re trying to give them \[clients\] a good risk-reward. Right now, the risk-reward, I would say, is about 10 to one negative,” Wilson said. “It’s just not great.”"|0.9|1332|0|1332

 ""Investors Take Sunny View Of Gloomy U.S. Jobs Data""

 *By* *E.S. Browning* Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

**May 7, 2001** 12:01 am ET 

 The economic indicators are gloomily heading south. The stock market is cheerfully heading north. What gives?

Economic hopes took a hit Friday, when investors learned that April unemployment, at 4.5%, was far higher than expected. Wages also were up more than expected, sparking worries on inflation. On top of that, President Bush's spokesman said the White House feared that strong first-quarter growth numbers, which had helped to boost stocks, might have to be revised downward.

It sounded like the economy might be heading down again, and stocks initially fell Friday morning. But then, curiously, the market turned around and stocks put in a substantial gain.

Some attributed it to a renewal of the old bull-market mentality. Hopes spread that the Federal Reserve now will stimulate the economy further by cutting rates by yet another half-percentage point when it holds its next policy meeting a week from Tuesday.

 But it is possible that an even simpler explanation is behind some of the buying: Over the past month, a lot of investors have begun to bet that the economy isn't going to get much worse and may well entirely avoid a recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline. Given all of the job cuts announced in April, the reasoning goes, an uptick in unemployment isn't a bad surprise at all. It is a sign that companies are taking their medicine and that the economy is hitting bottom.

There are plenty of experts who think that is fool's logic, that recession could be around the corner and that the market is headed down again. But that skeptical view is in the clear minority now. Expectations for technology stocks had fallen so low that the mere idea that the economy could be reaching bottom has been enough to give them a serious boost and help pull the entire market back up.

 ""I think that even a 5% unemployment number is not so steep as to really affect the broad economy,"" says Tim Morris, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust in New York. ""In a way, this is positive news because this is what companies had to do to get a handle on their earnings and margins. They had to attack the labor component of their cost structure.""

That helps explain why the tech group has been surging. On Friday, despite the negative economic news, the tech-led Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.11%, or 45.33 points, to 2191.53. It was up 5.6% for the week and ahead 34% since April 4. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.43%, or 154.59 points, on Friday, to 10951.24, up 1.3% for the week and up 15% since March 22.

 For the year so far, the industrials now are up 1.5%, but the beleaguered Nasdaq still is down 11%. The broad S&amp;P 500, which gained 1.44%, or 18.03 points, to 1266.61 on Friday, still is down 4.1% so far this year and is 17% off its record close of March 24, 2000.

It isn't that investors such as Mr. Morris have turned totally bullish. Mr. Morris has boosted his tech holdings to 18% from 12% of his portfolio, a 50% increase in a month. But his exposure to tech and communications stocks still is below that of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, which is around 26%. He had sold so much tech stock that all he had to do was turn somewhat less pessimistic in order to spark a sharp jump, in percentage terms, in his exposure.

George Cohen, president of New York money-management firm Cohen Klingenstein &amp; Marks, made a similar argument in a report to clients last week. ""It is our view that the economy is very close to the weakest point in the current slowdown, probably we are past it,"" Mr. Cohen wrote. His firm sold a lot of its tech holdings more than a year ago and shunned them until a few weeks ago. Now, he told his clients, ""the quality technology companies that have defined markets and huge profits have had their stock prices overcorrected. It is time to move back into them."" 

 There are plenty of people who are less hopeful about the economic data.

Bob Bissell, president of Wells Capital Management, Wells Fargo's money-management arm, agrees that, in all probability, ""we are past the worst"" in the economy, although he, too, says he wouldn't be surprised to see unemployment go to 5% before companies finish downsizing.

But he disagrees with Mr. Cohen on an important point: He doesn't see how technology companies can turn in business results to justify their huge recent stock gains. [Juniper Networks](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/JNPR) has more than doubled since April 4. [Intel](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/INTC) is up 36% and [Nokia](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/nok) is up more than 50% since then. What are they going to do now to justify further gains?

Even the best of the economic numbers still look weak, Mr. Bissell notes. Strong auto sales helped spark first-quarter growth, but many of those sales were made at little or no profit. He thinks the economy will remain weak and bonds may do better than stocks as the Fed keeps cutting interest rates in an effort to stave off recession.

""We think some major sectors of the economy will still go sideways for a while, including technology,"" he says. ""Companies aren't investing a lot of money in new technology initiatives. They still are in a wait-and-see mode."""|0.71|50|0|50

Some investors are starting to believe the worst of this year’s rout might be behind them. Data last week showed gauges of both consumer and producer prices [falling in July](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-july-2022-consumer-price-index-11660077986?mod=article_inline), offering some hope that inflation might be [at or close to a peak](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-definition-cause-what-is-it-11644353564?mod=article_inline). 

The labor market also [remains robust](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/july-jobs-report-unemployment-rate-economy-growth-2022-11659646690?mod=article_inline). Employers added more than half a million jobs in July, while the unemployment rate ticked down to close to a half-century low—hardly things investors would expect to see if the economy were in or on [the brink of a recession](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-this-is-a-recession-we-might-not-know-for-months-11659173402?mod=article_inline).📷

On the flip side, the Federal Reserve [isn’t done raising interest rates](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-raises-interest-rates-by-0-75-percentage-point-11658944935?mod=article_inline), leaving richly valued parts of the market vulnerable.Much of what has surged the past several weeks is precisely what led the market lower during its punishing selloff in the first half of the year. [Meme stocks](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/peloton-rivian-amc-gamestop-stock-market-psychology-11660250193?mod=article_inline) such as [AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC). and [Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BBBY). have climbed 107% and 111%, respectively, since markets bottomed for the year on June 16. Shares of cryptocurrency-related companies such as [Coinbase Global Inc](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/COIN). and triple-leveraged exchange-traded funds tracking the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index have also soared.

The S&amp;P 500 is up 17% over the same period but remains down 10% for the year. With inflation remaining near multiyear highs, some investors worry parts of the market are in for another punishing selloff, especially if the Fed has to raise interest rates for longer than expected. When interest rates were at historic lows, investors got big returns from piling into shares of richly valued, often unprofitable companies. 

The fact that bond yields were so low made even the riskiest stocks—as well as other investments, like cryptocurrencies—look like an attractive proposition for many investors. Rising rates reverse that dynamic.“I can’t argue that this pace \[of market gains\] is going to continue,” said Nancy Tengler,chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments. “Whether we are in recession now or are going to be in one in the third or fourth quarter, you know economic growth is going to slow.”That means it is prudent to be even more selective about what types of companies the firm is putting money into, she said.📷

One factor that has clouded investors’ outlook is debate over how far into the future the Fed will have to keep raising interest rates.Since the Fed’s July policy meeting, some investors have bet [the central bank will pivot](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-bet-fed-will-need-to-cut-interest-rates-next-year-to-bolster-the-economy-11658694486?mod=article_inline) from raising interest rates to lowering them next year to boost economic activity again. That has helped spark a rebound in not just stock but also bond prices. 

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which falls as bond prices rise, fell to 2.848% Friday, down from its mid-June peak of 3.482%.📷

Skeptics, however, warn that it might be too early to assume that the Fed will change tacks in 2023. July’s CPI and PPI readings were good news for the markets. And they certainly gave wind to the idea that the Fed will raise interest rates by half a point at its September meeting, instead of three-quarters of a point as initially expected.📷

But just one or two lower inflation readings won’t suffice in convincing the Fed that inflation is dissipating, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. Some factors driving inflation higher have also yet to ease. Last week’s CPI report showed grocery prices rose 13.1% in July from a year ago, the fastest pace since 1979. Housing prices [also increased](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-housing-affordability-in-june-was-the-worst-since-1989-11660312801?mod=article_inline). 

Given the way the Fed typically likes to see [multiple consecutive economic readings](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-michelle-bowman-says-large-interest-rate-rises-could-continue-11659802500?mod=article_inline) before changing tack on policy, markets might be running ahead of themselves, Mr. Colas said.Many investors are skeptical the recent rebound in more speculative investments will shake out differently this time."|0.6|4|0|4

The goal of this post is to analyze the company's fundamentals and provide insights that I believe are worth sharing. The main questions that I want to address are, is Coinbase going bankrupt, and is there anything that the management can do?

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Coinbase?**

In a nutshell, Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange platform founded back in June 2012. The description provided on their platform is a ""secure online platform for buying, selling, transferring and storing digital currency"".

&amp;#x200B;

**How does Coinbase make money?**

Almost 90% of all the revenue is related to transaction fees. Hence, to have a good idea of this stream, there are two separate parts to understand

1. Transaction value
2. Transaction fee (as % of the transaction value)

Let's start with the first part. As we are already aware that the underlying transaction is related to cryptocurrencies, the transaction value is tied to the price of the cryptocurrencies as it is measured in USD. A transaction of 1 Bitcoin when the price is $50k is worth twice more than a transaction of 1 Bitcoin when the price is $25k. In this example, although the volume of the underlying asset did not change, the value of the transaction measured in USD has changed.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the transaction fee, we need to make a distinction between the two types of users of the platform (I use the term user instead of investors as I believe it is more accurate):

1. Institutional users - accounting for 2/3 of the volume of the transactions (measured in $), but responsible for only 5% of the transactional fees (as their fee as a percentage is only 0.03%).
2. Retail users - accounting for 1/3 of the volume, but responsible for 95% of the transaction fees (as their fee as a percentage is 1.2%, roughly 40x higher than the one for institutional users)

&amp;#x200B;

**How can Coinbase grow?**

So, so far, we have a cryptocurrency exchange that makes money depending on:

1. The value of the transaction (that is linked to cryptocurrency prices)
2. The volume of transactions by retail users
3. The fee that Coinbase can take as a % of the transaction

Knowing these 3 variables, what is it that the management can do to increase the revenue?

In my opinion, not much. As for the cryptocurrency prices, they cannot (legally) influence them. As for the second and third, those are moving in opposite directions. To increase the volume, Coinbase could reduce the fees. However, that's not a sustainable way to grow.

&amp;#x200B;

**The financials**

To better understand the financials, it would be enough to take the last 2 full financial years (2020 and 2021) and the first half of 2022.

**2020** \- Revenue a bit over $1b, gross margin of 88%, operating expenses of $600m - ***looks great and profitable!***

**2021** \- Revenue a bit over $7b, gross margin of 83%, operating expenses of almost $3b - ***everything is growing and Coinbase is profitable!***

Now, how can we justify this huge increase in revenue of 7x? Well, cryptocurrency prices went up a bit over 5x, and the remaining part is due to increased volume. We can always link the performance back to the 3 variables above.

**H1 2022** \- Revenue of $2b, gross margin of 77%, operating expenses of $2.5b - ***doesn't look as good anymore***

Between December 31st, 2021, and June 30th, 2022, the prices of cryptocurrencies dropped by over 50%. Hence, if the revenue of 2021 was $7b, we should expect roughly $3.5b for the first half of 2022 (assuming the same volume of transactions were processed and the fee is the same). As the revenue is much lower, it indicates that there were fewer transactions as well (that is also reported by Coinbase in their quarterly report).

The real difficulty comes when you take a look at the operating expenses as half of 2022 is almost comparable to **the entire 2021!**

For a company that cannot take any action to increase the revenue, it is spending A LOT more and has started to lose money (again).

&amp;#x200B;

**The 3 bad news**

**#1 - Competition** \- They're not alone here, there's Crypto.com, Binance, Robinhood, FTX, eToro, Kraken, etc etc. Higher competition could have an impact on their 1% + fees for the retail users. That in turn could put them in an even more difficult financial position,

**#2 - MTU (Monthly transacting users)** \- One of the metrics that they have is related to the MTUs and in H1 2022 it is close to 9m (compared to 11m+ in 2021)

**#3 - Assets on the platform** \- Roughly 10% of all the assets have been withdrawn from their platform. Here's how I got to that conclusion:

**Bitcoin** represents 44% of the assets on the platform. That was equal to $111.2b as of December 31st, 2021. Since then, the Bitcoin price declined significantly. So, if the same assets were on the platform, they would've been priced $60.7b lower ($111.2b - $63.7b = $47.5b).

So, $47.5b would be the expected value of Bitcoin measured in USD at the end of Q2/2022. Based on the Q2 report, this amount is $42.2b, that's $5.3b lower, a little bit over 11% of what I would've expected. That represents a fair estimate of the assets that have been withdrawn from the platform!

**Ethereum** represents 20% of the assets on the platform, performing the same exercise, the percentage is 5%.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, what's next?** **How do we value Coinbase?**

Coinbase cannot be valued as the cash flows are dependent to a large extent on cryptocurrency prices (of course, they are also dependent on the volume &amp; the fee). That's why there's a 95% correlation between the stock price and Bitcoin.

However, we can give it a try to see what makes sense based on different assumptions

**Scenario 1 - Cryptocurrency prices (Especially Bitcoin/Ethereum) remain the same or decrease**

At the moment, Coinbase is burning roughly $3b/year (assuming they don't cut their operating expenses). With $5.7b on cash remaining, the company won't survive for a long period of time (unless new cash is raised)

**Scenario 2** \- **Cryptocurrency prices go back to the levels of last year, the volume of transactions goes back to the levels of last year, and the transaction fee that Coinbase charges remain the same as last year**

This assumes a stable environment (which we can all agree is not realistic), but for the sake of the exercise, let's give it a try.

Running a DCF based on these assumptions (and an operating margin of 25%), the value per share is around **$68/share**. It is lower than where the stock is currently trading and significantly lower than the IPO price of **$250/share**. This is with a 9% discount rate (based on WACC - which again can be argued is way too low based on the risk the company has).

&amp;#x200B;

**What can the management do?**

Put yourself in the shoes of Brian Armstrong (CEO of Coinbase) and ask yourself, what can be done? My personal view is, not much. If the revenue is dependent on the cryptocurrency prices and it is amplified with the user behavior, the only segment that the management can focus on is the operating expenses. That's Marketing &amp; Sales, Research &amp; Development, General &amp; Administrative.

However, even the best management in the entire world is helpless if cryptocurrency prices are low.

&amp;#x200B;

t3_wo474r|1660476547|stocks|Let's Talk About Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)|"Note : English is not my first language, sorry if i can't articulate my point properly.

**Background**

Early this year AT&amp;T spinoff their entertainment division, WarnerMedia to merge it with Discovery. The combined entity is now known as Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).

WBD started their first trading day, on April 11, 2022 closing at $24.78, but now the share price is at $13.78

**Why the stock dropping so much**

There are several reasons that might explain:

1)General market condition 

During April to July, we see a market correction across all indices, so WBD might be a victim of ""IPO"" at the wrong time.

Moreover, there seems to be general apathy toward media stocks as of right now that contributed to the price performance. You named it, from social media like Meta, Snap. Streaming co like Netflix, traditional media co like DIS, PARA, video game maker like TTWO, Ubisoft, RBLX.

2)AT&amp;T shareholder don't want to have anything to do with WBD

Most AT&amp;T shareholders are in it for the dividends, and yet WBD don't pay dividend and will likely to remain so in the few years as their priority is to reduce their leverage. So, it is likely that the stock tanked due to selling pressure from forced owner.

3)Management quality?

This is probably the major overhang. David Zaslav, the CEO seems like a capable and competent guy for the jobs, a long time veteran in media business. But unlike Disney, WarnerMedia on its own is a clusterfuck with no clear vision. Adding Discovery makes it even harder. Can Zaslav fixed it?

So far there are already questionable decisions like shutting off Batgirl when it is already finished, relaunching of new streaming services (when they have already invested billions growing HBO brand), DCEU problems, etc.

4)Very high leverage

Thanks in large part to AT&amp;T, WBD is saddled with very high level of debt. Of the $142 billion of total assets, about $53 billion is funded by debt, and total liabilities of $89 billion. To put thing into perspective, the current market cap for WBD is $33 billion. So every profit that they make, mostly will go to debt holder, instead to shareholders (yes, this is oversimplification).

5)Last result is not encouraging

The consesus estimate EPS for Q2 2022 is $0.12, yet the company record an earning loss (EPS) of $1.5

**Why this trade might work?**

1)It is cheap

Yes, a terrible investment thesis, especially when they just recorded an earning loss. All the potential synergy might never realizes, making this investment a total value trap. But again, it is cheap as of right now, and for all we know, all the bad things have already been priced in, no?

2)They have a strong collection of IP

DC Universe, Wizarding World (Harry Potter), Every shit HBO made (Game of Thrones, and i dont know), CNN, Oprah Winfrey, etc. 

Also, this can possibly makes them for prime takeover target.

Netflix prove that you need strong IP to win long term in media business, something that they severely lacks. Amazon bought MGM last years. It is no secret that big tech, whether it is Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and even Meta has lofty ambition in media industry.

3)Seems to be a favorite amongs superinvestor?

Michael Burry, David Einhorn, Seth Klarman loads up the position during Q2 2022. Buffett, bought shares in PARA, but i believe there are not much differences in business thesis between WBD and PARA.

4)Industry Tailwind

Both Disney and Netflix are planning to raise prices, signalling the priority for profits amongs media business. Cinema is making a comeback, midterm election means increasing ad spent for both parties, etc. 

An industry going back to its roots should be perfect time for David Zaslav to shine.

**What do you think?**

Personally, i have small position in the stocks. I see this as special situations where heavy selling pressure exist due to AT&amp;T shareholders selling their stake instead of business performance issue.

While high debt level is cause of some concern, they manage to lock the interest rate between 3%-5%.

Overall still manageable. Earning loss probably related to M&amp;A, and in due time should normalize to profitability.

What do you think? Please share what you though."|0.82|53|0|53

However, with the market being so volatile during the last year, I'm trying to reevaluate my approach. They say you should never trade ""news"", however, trading news in this environment was quite beneficial for me: from Disney to Charge Point, I was able to secure solid 20-30% gains for pretty much my entire ""gaming"" portfolio during the last 2 weeks.

And here is where I'm stuck now: market is very illogical and relying on fundamentals isn't beneficial in the short term.

Would it be a better thing to utilize ""take profit"" strategy on individual stocks, securing specific profit levels on all the plays made on the ""trading news"", then reinvest those gains into stable broad ETF, like SCHD which performs relatively good in current environment and is more protected from loses in case there is another drop so that I can wait a better buying opportunity for risky plays when the market gets red?

P. S. I now have about 50k in my Roth IRA and HSA accounts (starting from 20k in the beginning of the year) and use it exclusively for all the risky ""news based"" trading during the last 6 months, so tax issues aren't a concern for this specific case.

I'm not a bear, but I'm almost confident that many stocks would drop again in fall and winter (Fed is still gonna be proactive, European winter is a shit show, etc). It feels like reinvesting all the gains into more stable ETF could be a good strategy in this environment.

P. P. S. I know that timing the market is usually frowned upon, but I was super lucky this year getting huge gains in both brokerage and retirement accounts by following the stories about Ukraine, inflation, Netflix earnings and all the other fun things.

Cheers to the bull on recent market rally.

I have been on sidelines since Dec-Jan and I have enough cash ready to deploy. I am not trying to time the bottom but waiting for better economic environment. I did not buy in June thinking it would drop more and then I got busy in July with my new baby. I barely checked market and news in July and first week of August until last Monday when QQQ was 315 and SPY was 410 and I said to myself this will likely pullback and then I will start buying, but I was definitely wrong and market kept ripping.

Now everything is overvalued again. Forward S&amp;P 500 P/E is close to 19 which is high while Fed is hiking. AAPL is few dollars to ATH. MSFT is close to 290. TSLA is 900.

I am not an expert, but I cannot wrap my head around this massive rally. Fed is still hiking. Inflation seemed to have peaked but too soon to tell before August CPI.  However, it does not seem we will revisit June bottom, and that is ok, but I am hoping for a pullback in S&amp;P to below 4000.

My current plan is to start small DCA'ing next week and wait until September (most volatile month and before next fed meeting) and start buying at lump sums if S&amp;P 500 goes below 4000.

&amp;#x200B;

But are you buying (not scalping) at these levels? and if so, why do you think market might further rip from here while Fed is still hiking with no signs of pivot and economy is still slowing?

Facebook and Apple have been at odds for several years now; Apple announced back at WWDC 2020 that iOS would require apps to ask users to opt-in to cross-app advertising tracking. Facebook spent much of the next months speaking out against Apple's plans and predicting revenue instability due to the upcoming changes, but the feature was released in iOS 14.5 back in April of 2021. Somewhat surprisingly, though, a new report from The Wall Street Journal claims that before this all went down, Facebook and Apple were working on a partnership and revenue-sharing agreement.

According to the Journal, Apple and Facebook were considering a a subscription service that would offer an ad-free version of the platform. And since Apple takes a cut of in-app purchases, including subscriptions, it could have been a very lucrative arrangement indeed. Another arrangement that was discussed and ended up being a point of contention was Apple taking a cut of ""boosted posts,"" which essentially amounts to paying to put a post in front of a larger audience. Facebook has long considered boosted posts part of its advertising portfolio; as the Journal notes, small businesses often use boosted posts to reach more people. The issue came down to Apple saying boosts should be considered in-app purchases, which would be subject to the 30 percent revenue cut that the company takes. Facebook, on the other hand, maintained that those were advertising products which aren't subject to Apple's cut.

Since rolling out its user-tracking changes in 2021, research firm Insider Intelligence claims that 37 percent of iPhone users have opted in to letting companies track their activity across apps. Since the change went into effect, Facebook (now Meta) has seen its revenue growth shrink significantly — and last quarter, Meta reported the first revenue decline in the company's history."|0.93|99|0|99

\- Bitcoin 44%

\- Etherium 20%

\- Other crypto 29%

\- Fiat currency 7%

The value of the assets on the platform has decreased from **$278b** at the end of 2021 to **$96b** as of June 30th, 2022. Of course, a large part of this is due to the decrease in cryptocurrency prices. 

So, I did a simple exercise to understand whether users have withdrawn assets or not (and if so, how much):

As of December 31st, 2021, there was $111.2b in Bitcoin. Taking into account the price decrease until June 30th, 2022, this would've been equal to $50.5b (assuming no new deposits nor withdrawals). Coinbase reported Bitcoin equal to $42.2b, that's 16% lower than expected and it is a fair estimate of withdrawals.

If I perform the same exercise for Etherium, the outcome is a withdrawal of a bit over 10% of the assets.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uzurrf/whats\_happening\_in\_the\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uzurrf/whats_happening_in_the_market/)

TLDR from previous post: Market rallies on the back of strong earnings until \~3Q of this year. At this time, people will start to talk about FOMO since they missed the bottom. At the same time, consumer demand begins to contract and the death spiral begins. This will result in a strong recession in 2023 and we will see the bottom only when the fed steps in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I think the future of the market all comes down to inflation. Will supply recover to meet the continued strong demand, or will that only happen through demand destruction with further rate increases? If supply does recover without demand destruction, we could achieve the soft landing, which is what the market is pricing in now imo. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I see with the soft landing, even if achieved, is the lack of slack in the current economy. We have the lowest unemployment in decades, and I don't see that going any lower. This means that both demand will stall at current levels (only grow in line with wage growth) and productivity will stall outside of efficiency through innovation. IMO, this means that if we achieve the soft landing, the future of the economy still isn't great. We will only see growth through inflation, and there isn't much room at all to grow real GDP. The FED will have to play a tight rope of managing money supply so inflation doesn't go rampant, without destroying demand to the point of the recessionary death spiral.

&amp;#x200B;

The FED may be able to walk that tight rope for a while but at some point it's going to give. Also, once the consumer starts to slow spending, the death spiral will begin on its own, regardless of inflation. Never underestimate the American consumer to spend money they don't have on things they don't need -- but I do think we will see weakening in consumer spending later this year as the cost of inflation catches up to consumer balance sheets. This could start the death spiral by Q4 this year and bring on a real recession. If they continue to spend, and inflation eases, then this death spiral could be pushed off for who knows how long, but ultimately I think will occur in the next year or two due to reasons mentioned previously.

&amp;#x200B;

Current market positions: I have no idea what will happen but there are enough risks in the market that could trigger a recession that are leading me to be cautious. Currently holding a low beta portfolio and will transition short once there are some signs of consumer spending weakening or inflation remaining hot."|0.6|4|0|4

The thing is, a major recession is always accompanied by some of the largest bull rallies on the way down and accompanied by characteristics that people never think that it’s going to go down again.

What seems obvious to me is if you look at the market, over the pandemic it skyrocketed in the fastest and largest bull market in history, but meanwhile there were global lockdowns and businesses shutting down left and right, the government went into accelerated debt and all this growth was literally free money being pumped into the markets from the Fed. Where do people get the idea that a major correction isn’t due/over? Where is the abundance of production and profits that would justify the market still being this high? (Especially if prices and evaluations are quantified next to inflation, the real inflation is also much higher than the manipulated 8.5%)

While the job market is doing relatively well, there are still reports of large layoffs happening and showing no sign of slowing. We have had literally One single good report but anyone that read the report saw that food, shelter and energy were still up, and food shortage issues are expected to get worse toward the end of the year.

But the biggest hint of all is that the Fed still has made no signs of a pivot and I think a lot of people are confusing inflation being past it’s peak with the actual issue being resolved. Supply chains are barely recovered, inflation around the world is way worse than America and if their economies hit hyper inflation their contributions to supply chains will only get worse.

I’m just going to say it: there is no full resolutions to justify the markets at these prices. There are too many signs showing this is an emotional (greed) bull rally trap. None of the underlying problems have been solved, monetary policy will not change until at least 4-5% inflation, and instead of the Russian situation getting better- intel shows when winter comes it will only get worse and China/Taiwan is now a potential new threat. Maybe this rally will last another month or so, but new all time highs are probably not until after another downturn. Thoughts?"|0.67|100|0|100

 Aug 12 (Reuters) - Peloton Interactive Inc [**(PTON.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/PTON.O) said on Friday it would cut jobs, shut stores and raise prices on its exercise equipment including treadmills and top-end bikes as it undertakes a company-wide revamp to shore up its revenue and improve cash flow.

Under Chief Executive Officer Barry McCarthy, Peloton has implemented a slew of measures including cost cuts to steady its business as a pandemic-driven demand for its treadmills and exercise bikes quickly fizzles. On Friday, the company outlined a plan to aggressively reduce its retail presence in the United States and eliminate a number of jobs in warehouses and customer support teams.

I must admit that I bought in at much higher prices without much research. After holding for some time and a few quarterly earnings later, I figured that the management execution is not up to my expectations and the business have no real strong moats. Here are some of the reasons that made me decide to take the loss:

1. There's too much competition in the FinTech space that no single player can dominate.
2. Path to profitability is unclear, business model lacks scalability.
3. Poor acquisition actions. Buying TIDAL that doesn't really add synergy to the core business. Paid a sky-high valuation for AFTERPAY in the form of stock, resulting in huge share dilution. Revenue addition from Afterpay is not impressive either.
4. Invest in speculative assets and businesses (Bitcoin) when main business isn't profitable yet.
5. Valuation is still arguably expensive even after the recent plunge. Growth rates have slowed, and there's no clear plan to accelerate it. Uncertain if the current business model has any operating leverage.

Basically that's it. Lost my conviction to hold. They might get hit further if we go into a deep recession since a lot of their customers are SMEs.

ESG RATINGS:

&gt;Sustainalytics gives Tesla an ESG score of 28.6. It’s ranked 42 out of 83 in the automobiles sector, being beaten by the likes of Mercedes-Benz at 22.1 (lower being better).  
&gt;  
&gt;Why is this?  
&gt;  
&gt;[This article](https://www.grcworldforums.com/news-and-insight/teslas-low-esg-score-can-partly-be-explained-by-figure-skating/4101.article) published in February 2022 by the GRC World Forum suggests that the reason for the low ESG score is due to Elon Musk, or more accurately — the analysts opinions of Elon.  
&gt;  
&gt;The author notes:  
&gt;  
&gt;*For transparency, labor relations, adherence to governance, for example, having a CEO who doesn’t send out random tweets, Tesla scores poorly*  
*\[Tesla’s 2019 impact statement\] “was not exactly a statement that endeared Tesla to those who create ESG scores”*  
&gt;  
&gt;Musk is correct about the oil companies here, two oil companies ([OMV AG: 27.4](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/omv-ag/1008289354) and [Repsol: 26.4](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/repsol-s-a/1008201748)) both have better scores than Tesla.  
&gt;  
&gt;The key problem here is that E,S and G are all weighted equally, while not close to being equal in practice. E can be quantified, while S and G are entirely subjective. The equal weighting of each metric means that companies outstanding in one area are beaten out by seemingly much worse companies overall because of the other two dimensions.  
&gt;  
&gt;The scores also don’t account for the wider impact that a company might have had, for example Tesla isn’t given get credit for helping to push other automakers towards EV’s. Regardless of how you feel about Tesla or Musk, it’s undeniable that had tesla not proved profitably and consumer demand, the EV market would not be as developed as it is today.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is most egregiously demonstrated by the fact that T[esla has been dropped from the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/18/why-tesla-was-kicked-out-of-the-sp-500s-esg-index.html) for concerns about their working environment after being sued in a racial discrimination lawsuit.  
&gt;  
&gt;You might agree that this is the correct course of action, if so, you will also likely agree that Amazon should be dropped after being sued for telling it’s employees to work through a severe weather warning, [resulting in six of them being killed after the building was hit by a tornado](https://ca.movies.yahoo.com/amazon-sued-by-family-of-employee-killed-in-warehouse-tornado-collapse-085656743.html), yet amazon remains the funds third largest holding.  
&gt;  
&gt;You might also disagree that Nestle, a company that was sued earlier in the year for [profiting from child slavery](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/business/hershey-nestle-mars-chocolate-child-labor-west-africa/) be given a 4.9 rating by FTSERussel and subsequently included in the [FTSE4Good Index](https://www.nestle.com/ask-nestle/health-nutrition/answers/what-is-ftse4good)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;[This study from MIT Sloan](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-mit-sloan-study-discovers-widespread-and-repeated-retroactive-changes-to-esg-scores-301576360.html) shows that there are “widespread and repeated” retroactive changes to ESG scores by ESG ratings agencies in order to establish this relationship.  
&gt;  
&gt;*He explains that the data for any specific point in time should remain the same for a firm unless there is a documented reason for a retroactive change. However, their study revealed significant unannounced and unexplained changes to the data provided by* [*Refinitive ESG*](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3579819-1&amp;h=2880314828&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.refinitiv.com%2Fen%2Ffinancial-data%2Fcompany-data%2Fesg-data&amp;a=Refinitive+ESG)*, which was previously owned by Thomson Reuters. For example, looking at two versions of the same Refinitive ESG data for identical firm years — one from September 2018 and the other from September 2020 — the median overall scores in the rewritten data were 18% lower than in the initial data.*  
*He notes that the data rewriting occurs on an ongoing basis without any public announcements. To show this, the researchers compared ESG scores from February 9 and March 23, 2021 — just six weeks apart — and found that 85% of firms’ scores changed. While the score changes were mostly small in magnitude, the ongoing retroactive changes affected the classification of firms and the link between ESG scores and returns.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *Using predictive regressions, they showed that investing in firms with higher ESG scores in the initial data would not have led to economically or statistically significant performance gains. Yet, in the rewritten data, they found economically large, statistically significant positive effects of the E&amp;S score on the firm’s future stock returns. These large differences matter because this performance would not have been possible with the data available to investors when forming their investment strategies.* 

ESG FUNDS:

&gt;*Sector exposures across the funds revealed that information technology was the largest allocation in most funds, and an almost zero allocation in energy. This was one of the key drivers behind the shorter-term recent outperformance of ESG funds relative to their non-ESG counterparts, as tech stocks rallied in 2020 whilst energy declined.*  
&gt;  
&gt;So the overperformance of ESG funds compared to a wide index was because they are tech heavy.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Google was the most commonly held stock across most funds; Alphabet Inc. was in 12 funds, with an average weight of 1.9% . The companies with the highest average weight across the funds were Apple (5.6%) and Microsoft (5.0%)*  
&gt;  
&gt;So ESG funds are basically investing in the same things that most other funds do: Tech (FAANG) and industrials, with very little, if any allocation towards energy. This is permissible by their rules because all of these companies have good ESG scores. Afterall their CEO’s don’t tweet.

&gt;  
&gt;[Prevailing wisdom for the last decade has been for investors to consistently buy the index.](https://www.silverlightinvest.com/blog/why-warren-buffett-making-argument-passive-investing)  
&gt;  
&gt;The has meant the last decade has seen a steady increase in capital away from actively managed funds and into passive index funds and ETF’s:  
&gt;  
&gt;The assets of equity index funds surpassed [actively managed funds in 2019](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2019/09/20/passive-overtakes-active-in-us-stock-fund-assets-morningstar/).

&gt;  
&gt;The prospects for fund managers being able to attract young investors were not looking particularly positive until they found a new target:  
&gt;  
&gt;The Socially Conscious Investor.  
&gt;  
&gt;ESG funds are largely investing in the same ways that ‘standard’ funds do. This is allowed because the structuring of the ESG metric and the altering of data by ESG ratings agencies means that fund managers are able to invest in whatever they would like.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the ESG rating of one provider doesn’t allow them to invest in the way they would like — they can simply choose another that does.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The entire point of third party ratings is that the average investor doesn't have to concern themselves with it. The judgments are abstracted away from them.   
&gt;  
&gt; Which is probably why most of the money flowing into ESG is going into active funds: 

 

&gt;Actively managed funds, and their fund managers salaries were being threatened by younger, savvy investors that might have otherwise invested into a passive index funds.  
&gt;  
&gt;These funds have figured out a way to not only bring younger investors on board, but also charge an [average 43% higher fee for ESG funds than for regular funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tidal-wave-of-esg-funds-brings-profit-to-wall-street-11615887004) It would be a very impressive feat of marketing if it wasn’t so deceptive.  
&gt;  
&gt; I’m an ethically-minded millennial investor. Instead of investing in an ESG fund I'm going with the optimal investment method of consistently buying into a passive index and then donating a portion of my gains to charity.

In the past 6 month, my strategy has been ""buy more deeper dips"", basically my purchase doubled with every 5-10% drop, e.g. +10 shares, +20 shares (-10%), +50 shares (-20%), +100 shares (-30%) etc. Fortunately the market started to turn around before I run out of bullets. 

However what I didn't do, and don't like to do (or couldn't do) is to average up, I also have (slightly less) problem paying more than the lowest price I paid before. For example, YTD the lowest SPY I got was $363, that was my last purchase of SPY even though my average is $392. There were plenty of opportunities in $370's and $380's range that I saw but consciously ignored to continue to buy (and average down). As soon as SPY crossed $392, I stopped watching it because I couldn't bring myself to average up. 

I'm sure you see a lot of flaws in my methods and would probably advise ""time in the market....."" or ""just DCA and chill"". Yes I understand these methods and there are stats to back them up, but the emotional/psychological side of me is actively resisting them. 

Now the weekend is here, can you guys recommend books (chapters) or articles that specifically address these behaviours?

# Stock Rally Builds With Longest Weekly Run of 2022: Markets Wrap

* US consumer sentiment rises to three-month high on outlook
* BofA says cash racing to stocks, bonds as inflation fears ease

 

Stocks finished the week on solid footing, with traders assessing  whether an inflation slowdown could soon make the Federal Reserve reduce  the pace of its most-aggressive tightening campaign in decades and  prevent a hard landing.

Defying the crowd of skeptics who dubbed  the rebound a bear-market rally or short-covering, the S&amp;P 500 had a  fourth straight week of gains, the longest such run since November. The  gauge recouped more than [50%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-12/out-of-the-woods-the-s-p-500-recovers-50-of-year-s-drawdown)  of the losses it notched between its January peak and June nadir, and  approached its 200-day average -- a line crossed by the Russell 2000 of  small caps. The Nasdaq 100 pushed further beyond its technical  bull-market threshold, following a surge of over 20% from June lows.

As  equities climbed, Wall Street’s fear gauge crumbled. The Cboe  Volatility Index slumped back below 20, the average level since its  inception. The VIX notched its eighth straight week of declines, the  longest losing stretch since 2019. Meantime, the S&amp;P 500’s 14-day  relative strength index (RSI) topped 70 -- which is seen by some traders  as one indication of an overbought market.

The next few weeks will be crucial in determining the  sustainability of the rally. With the earnings season almost over,  economic reports mixed at best and many Fed speakers unwillling to sound  too dovish, some analysts see the chances of a breather. To Matt Maley  at Miller Tabak, stocks are indeed getting overbought on a  very-short-term basis, so a decline or sideways move “would not be the  worst development in the world.”

For now, flows have been robust. [Global equity funds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-12/bofa-says-cash-racing-to-stocks-bonds-as-inflation-fears-ease)  lured $7.1 billion in the week through Aug. 10, Bank of America Corp.  strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote, citing EPFR Global data. Bond  funds had an intake of $11.7 billion, while $4.3 billion was pulled out  of cash.

“The music hasn’t stopped,” said Matt Bartolini, State Street  Global Advisors’ head of SPDR Americas Research. “The labor market  continues to be positive, earnings growth continues to be positive. So  largely, if there is a recession, it’s going to be relatively shallow.”

Lindsey  Bell, chief markets and money strategist at Ally, said the market’s  about to enter what is often considered a “sketchy period.” 

“Historically,  September and October are notoriously volatile, sometimes featuring big  stock market drops,” she wrote. “After a more than 10% rally since  mid-June, a bearish seasonal trend is good reason to temper  expectations. I expect this market to continue to be reactionary and  driven by headlines until we have more clarity on where exactly  inflation is headed as we approach 2023.”

Data Friday showed [US consumer sentiment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-12/us-consumer-sentiment-rises-to-three-month-high-on-outlook)  climbed to a three-month high on firmer expectations about the economy  and personal finances. Inflation expectations were mixed, with consumers  boosting their longer-term views for prices slightly, while reducing  their year-ahead outlook for costs.

Fed  Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin was the latest official to  call for continued rate increases, while acknowledging that this week’s  inflation figures were encouraging. His San Francisco counterpart Mary  Daly told [Bloomberg Television](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-12/fed-s-daly-says-cooling-inflation-is-welcome-but-no-victory-yet)  that the slowdown in price pressures may mean it’s appropriate for the  central bank to slow the pace of hikes to 50 basis points in September--  but noted the fight against inflation is far from over.

“The Fed  is unlikely to claim victory until inflation reaches target, but recent  data support our view that peak Fed hawkishness is behind us,” Bank of  America strategists wrote in a note to clients.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 15th, 2022.

# **Dow closes up 400 points, S&amp;P 500 rises for fourth straight week as investors warm to cooler inflation - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/11/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks rose sharply on Friday, clinching the fourth straight positive week for the S&amp;P 500 as investors celebrated signs that inflation may be peaking.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 424.38 points, or 1.27%, to close at 33,761.05. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.73% to finish at 4,280.15, and the Nasdaq Composite surged 2.09% to 13,047.19.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rose 3.26% on the week, notching its longest weekly winning streak since November 2021. The Dow was up 2.92% for the week, while the Nasdaq Composite moved higher by 3.08%. For the Nasdaq, it was also the fourth positive week in a row.
*****
&gt; The averages have been boosted by positive news on the inflation front. The consumer price index was flat from June to July, thanks in large part to falling gas prices, which lowered headline inflation. The producer price index showed a surprise decline. On Friday, import prices also fell more than expected.
*****
&gt; This week’s moves have extended a market rally off its mid-June lows. The S&amp;P 500 has gained 16.7% since the lows, and has cut its losses from the peak in half. The Dow had gained nearly 13% and the Nasdaq Composite has rebounded 22.6%.
*****
&gt; The positive news has bolstered investor confidence, leading some to believe that the recent gains are more than a typical bear market rally.
*****
&gt; “We are not arguing that the market will make new highs this year (we are more in the trading range camp), but we would not be surprised to see a run toward the highs as inflation eases and the Fed slows the pace of rate hikes,” Michael Darda, chief economist and market strategist at MKM Partners, said in a note.

&gt; # VIX and Volatility Have Historically Increased August through October

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/68b1e7f12dc8ccdadd077b69e5bd7c7a/17946972bd670247-1d/s500x750/14cedaf89a9fd48dad4f61e19abee9bc8415ae56.jpg))**

&gt; Historically speaking, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) tends to reach its seasonal low in late-July or early August and slowly begin climbing towards its seasonal high, usually in the month of October. This may be due to the fact that the two worst performing months of the year, August and September (by average performance) precede it. VIX’s seasonal pattern can be seen in the following chart.

&gt; October’s volatility peak is also visible when closing daily percent changes are analyzed. October has hosted the most daily moves in excess of 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 7% and even 10% since 1930. Do not fret over the ten times S&amp;P 500 has moved more than 10% in a single day. Six of the ten occurrences were way back in the 1930’s. Only four have occurred more recently and out of those, two were actually positive days (10/13/2008 +11.58% and 10/28/2008 +10.79%). Only three of the ten days with moves in excess of 10% were negative days: 3/18/1935 –10.06%, 10/19/1987 –20.47% and 3/16/2020 –11.98%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c97cdfde9fdb3ead4650f09a5bfeeadc/17946972bd670247-31/s500x750/d7fc2cba796719dd3d486147337a13ab3fbffb73.jpg))**

&gt; Putting all but the +/-1% moves table data into a bar chart adds a quick confirmation of October’s heightened volatility versus all other months. Volatility’s trend can also be observed as the frequency of sizable daily moves tends to decline from March through July then an increase in August lasting until October.

&gt; # High Short Interest Revival

&gt; As we detailed in last night's Closer, whatever name that it might be given—meme stocks, yolo trades, or ""stonks""—there has been a trend recently in which there has been strong performance of highly volatile names loved by the most risk tolerant retail investor. That is roughly a year and a half to the day of the meme stock mania where highly shorted names saw massive short squeezes driven by the retail community.

&gt; Since the mid-June lows, highly shorted names have again been outperforming. Below we show the chart of an index covering the 100 most highly shorted stocks going back to early 2020. The vast majority of 2020 gains have been erased, however, this index has also risen 46% since its June 16th low (the same date as the broader market's low). On a relative basis, the most heavily shorted stocks have been outperforming the Russell 3,000 in that time resulting in the relative strength line to break out of the downtrend that has been in place since the peak of the meme stock mania in late January of last year. That being said, the index itself has much further to go in order to break out of its downtrend off of that high in price.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081022-SIPF-1.png))**

&gt; Below we show the stocks within the Russell 3,000 that currently have the highest levels of short interest as of the end of July. The only stock with more than 50% of its float sold short is Torrid Holdings (CURV). The next highest is a company that frequently finds itself high up on the list of highly shorted stocks: Dillard's (DDS). While those readings are elevated, they are well below what had been the most heavily shorted stock a month and a half ago. As of the mid-June update, Redbox (RDBX) had an extremely elevated reading on short interest that was closing in on 100%. Today that reading has collapsed back down to a still elevated but less extreme 41.5%. We would also note, however, that RDBX is a messy story at the moment in the midst of an acquisition (confirmed to go through in the past 24 hours) with the potential to save the company from bankruptcy.

&gt; Other notables on the list of most heavily shorted stocks include grill-maker Weber (WEBR), Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY), Upstart (UPST), Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV), Beyond Meat (BYND), Groupon (GRPN), and Nikola (NKLA).

&gt; Below is a look at price charts for most of the heavily shorted stocks listed in the table above. While many of these names are up huge since mid-June, the gains hardly register on six-month charts because they got hit so hard in the first half of the year.

&gt; # The Nature of Risk

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2e7c24f3af99c0197abcfb74fd392c6c/e2f796e9605c0091-8f/s500x750/d2cc94d79f2dab634b5a2cb53aa808454c4d29f0.jpg))**

&gt; Here is a little sneak peek into the 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac from Justin Mamis’ The Nature of Risk that is remarkably apropos now. 2022 continues to track this Sentiment Cycle rather closely.

&gt; Just before we presented at the CMT Association’s 2022 Annual Symposium veteran technical analyst Helene Meisler shared Mamis’ Sentiment Cycle along with her analysis of where in the cycle the market was at the time at the end of April 2022—in that brief pause between disbelief and panic (green circle).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f7776586866f6c633e54944732814347/e2f796e9605c0091-7e/s500x750/5179db6b975ce431bbac4c5ce8484a90afacdd84.jpg))**

&gt; Comparing the current chart of the S&amp;P 500 below we’ve highlighted in yellow that area of disbelief Ms. Meisler pointed out in April. The June low correlates quite well with Panic and we are now hitting the first level of Anxiety.

&gt; This dovetails with our seasonal/cycle outlook for a lower low or retest of the lows over the next three months as we are in the worst two months of the year and are smack dab in the “Weak Spot” of the 4-Year Cycle from Q2 to Q3 of the midterm election year, which sets up the Sweet Spot and the Quadrennial Rally.

&gt; We will know more tomorrow after the big CPI report comes out. If CPI cools considerably that would suggest we have passed the Panic point and are on the other side of Discouragement and climbing the Wall of Worry toward Anxiety before a higher low at Aversion.

&gt; # Inflation Still Top Of Mind for Small Business

&gt; While fewer respondents to this month's NFIB small business survey reported that they observed higher prices, inflation continues to be a front and center concern. The percentage of respondents reporting inflation as their biggest problem has risen further to another record high of 37%. That completely erased June's drop down to 34%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080922-NFIB-MIP-1a.png))**

&gt; While broad inflation is currently the most pressing problem, other inflation-related measures also rose in July. The percentage of firms reporting cost of labor as their single most important problem rose to 9%, although that is still below the record high reading of 13% at the end of last year.

&gt; While we often combine that reading with the percentage of responses reporting quality of labor as the biggest issue as a gauge of labor market health, the latter problem dropped 2 percentage points to net out the rise in cost of labor. On a combined basis, these two concerns are now tied with March at 30% for the lowest level since January 2021 (28%).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080922-NFIB-MIP-1.png))**

&gt; One other combined reading that we often check in on is the percentage of respondents reporting government requirements or taxes as their biggest issues. Over the past few decades, Republican administrations have usually coincided with lower readings whereas Democrat administrations would see a higher reading. With inflation concerns surging this year, a historically low share of businesses are concerned about government action. The combined reading fell to another record low of 16% in July with the entirety of that drop on account of a 3 percentage point decline in government requirements and red tape.

&gt; # Risk of Default Declining

&gt; We like to use credit default swaps (a product that pays out investors if a reference company defaults) to track risk premiums in the corporate bond market. When risk premiums rise, credit default swaps get more expensive, and the spread implied between risk free rates and CDS rises.

&gt; As recession fears intensified throughout the first half of 2022, both the investment grade and high yield credit default swap indices skyrocketed, gaining 106.7% and 110.5% between the start of the year and the highs, respectively. However, earnings were not as bad as feared, economic data is starting to come in better than expected, gas prices have fallen, and CPI seems to have peaked in June. All of this has caused substantial declines in CDS index spreads, with the risk premium associated with each falling by about a quarter since their summer peak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/CDX-HY-081122.jpg))**

&gt; Although CDX High Yield's spread is well off of its highs, it is still above the average over the last ten years, implying a still elevated risk related to recession and potential defaults. We can also tie CDS indices to the performance of actual corporate bonds. The option-adjusted spread (a proxy for the credit risk over risk-free rates for a given investment) for high yield bonds in the ""cash"" market has a 0.88 correlation to CDS over the past decade. Notably, the CDX HY spread remains above its long-term average, while that High Yield Average OAS is below its average, implying investors may be getting under-compensated for the risk they are taking in the high yield debt market.

&gt; # Normalizing Sentiment

&gt; Sentiment has continued to head back towards more normal levels as equities press higher. The latest reading from the AAII on the percentage of investors that are bullish on the S&amp;P 500 over the next six months reached the highest level since March. At 32.2%, bullish sentiment is now only 5.5% below the historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081122-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The reading on bearish sentiment meanwhile has dropped to 36.7% which is also the lowest reading since the end of March; the last time this reading was below 30%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081122-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Although both bullish and bearish sentiment are closing in on one another, bears continue to outnumber bulls. The bull-bear spread rose to -4.5 this week extending the streak of negative readings to 19 weeks long. At the moment, that is the third longest streak on record and would need to continue for at least three weeks more to tie the second-longest streak on record of 22 weeks ending in December 1990.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081122-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; While the bull-bear spread remains negative for the AAII survey, other sentiment surveys have been showing more bullish sentiment. The Investors Intelligence survey has had a positive bull-bear spread for three weeks in a row now, and the NAAIM exposure index has shown investment managers have been quick to add exposure to equities in recent weeks. Standardizing these three survey results (measuring each one in how many standard deviations from the long-term average they are), the NAAIM and Investors Intelligence surveys are now back into positive territory. In other words, these two surveys are actually showing sentiment as having moved slightly above what has been the historical norm. Meanwhile, the AAII reading is far more negative even if it is trending higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081122-AAII-5.png))**

&gt; Additionally, those are the first positive readings in some time. For the NAAIM index, the z-score has not seen a positive reading in 15 weeks. That is the longest stretch without a positive reading since the first quarter of 2016 and prior to that, there have only been a handful of other streaks that have gone on as long. For the Investors Intelligence survey, it was an even rarer streak ending at 29 weeks long. That was the longest since one that went on for roughly a year and ended in May 2009. Prior to that, you would have to go all the way back to 1995 to find a longer streak.

&gt; Then there are the AAII results. Still going at 32 weeks long, the z-score has only been negative for as many consecutive weeks once in the survey's history, and that was during 2020. All of this is to say that the AAII survey has been leaning more pessimistically than other surveys even as overall sentiment has largely made its way back to historically normal levels.

Usually I just log online and chose electronic delivery for future correspondences and NO to the reports.

But it seems they still come pouring in the year later.
So..
1) does anyone know how it's regulated? Is your broker responsible for all that?
2) who actually votes? I vote when I see big decisions ""pay upgrades"", strategic decisions or contentious issues but mostly it's to elect 15 idiots who I have no interest in
3) is there a way to get everything electronic? I still receive letters with the god damn code. Just send me an email (some do it)
4) I believe there are 2 or 3 platforms.. proxycode and the other I don't remember. It does work quite well and would provide a decent platform to do everything from there without receiving the paperwork for those electing to use 100% online... Does the stock or the broker decide which platform to use and why had no real industry winner emerged?
5) tldr it's a big waste of money, paper, and time.

t3_wmyw7e|1660345918|stocks|Why so many ways to invest in retirement?|"Young and dumb student here trying to get a head start on getting my finances in order. So I keep hearing about these different investment strategies and all their benefits and whatnot, but I still would like some clarification on what/why they all exist. From what I understand:

- **401k**: retirement fund that my company takes a cut out of my paycheck to support. Main benefit is that the company will contribute some money on their own.

**Questions**: What does it mean to “max out my 401k” and why might I want to do that?

- **Roth IRA and IRA**: Stock portfolio meant for retirement planning. Roth IRAs have the specification that money is taxed as it goes into the account, meaning when time comes to retire, the money in your Roth will not be taxed.

**Questions**: Why would I contribute to an IRA rather than just keeping a personal portfolio that I DCA into every month? It just seems easier since there’s no limit for income or yearly contributions

- **Stock portfolio**: A collection of publicly traded stocks that I personally curate.

My main question is why I should bother splitting my money across all these different platforms, when it just seems easier to put it all in a personal stock portfolio. I can see why the company matching for a 401k is beneficial obviously, but not so much Roth or traditional IRAs. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!"|0.75|4|0|4

t3_wmsjwj|1660329424|stocks|From here everything depends on oil prices - so where do you think they're heading?|"The price of oil has an impact on the price of almost everything. While oil doesn't have any direct impact core inflation numbers it does have a large indirect impact simply because energy is an input to almost every good and service in the economy.

We seem to be at a crossroads right now with some analyst believing oil is going higher and others believing the trend from here will be neural to lower.

I know next to nothing about the oil market, but here are a few things I believe are important:  


* **Oil demand has declined in 2022.**  
With few expectations almost every year has seen increased demand for oil but 2022 has been an exception in part due to China lockdowns, less office commuting, and some amount of demand destruction. We can say with certainty that demand for oil will recover at some point, but whether that will be in a month or 6 is less clear.
* **The US has been releasing oil for the SPR**  
In an attempt to keep oil prices down the US has been releasing oil from its strategic reserves, but these reserves are now running out. Releases from the strategic reserves will come to an end over the coming months and at some point the US will need to begin refilling these reverses, increasing demand.
* **Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues**  
Russia's invasion of Ukraine shows no signs of coming to an end anytime soon and by the end of 2022 Europe plans to end all imports of Russian oil. This is likely to reduce Russian oil output further tightening supply.
* **Secular underinvestment**  
Secular underinvestment and political grandstanding against oil companies has resulted in little spare capacity. To bring more capacity to the market will take time and requires an unlikely amount of political pragmatism.
* **Recession?**  
If global growth slows and the US enters recession this should cap demand near-term. However recession odds are largely tide to oil prices. If oil prices rise significantly so will recession odds, but increased recession odds will reduce the price of oil. In recent weeks the bond market and commodity market seem to be pricing in an increased risk of recession, however the stock market and stronger than expected earnings and economic data seem to be suggesting the opposite.
* **Oil alternatives**  
Investment in nuclear power, green energy sources and increased usage of EVs could offset some of the demand for oil in the West longer-term. China and Germany are also likely to turn to coal as near-term alternative to oil. However higher natural gas prices could also have the effect of increasing demand for oil as some industries seek alternative energy sources.

On the surface it seems at least for the next 12-24 months there will be an ongoing trade-off between economic growth and oil prices. If global economic growth accelerates too much oil prices are likely to move higher which could push up inflation and trigger a US recession from higher rates and higher prices. The bull case here is probably that China lockdowns continue until at least the end of the year and Europe reconsiders Russian oil sanctions while investing in domestic energy production. However this seems unlikely.

My guess is that if oil prices continue to fall we could see a second wave of inflation caused by in part by lower oil prices temporarily boosting confidence and causing the Fed to pause hikes prematurely. Then again I have no clue and I'd assuming the market knows more than me. Curious to hear what you guys think."|0.81|9|0|9

A TL;DR can also be found [here](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-08-12-2022/card/consumer-sentiment-rises-better-than-expected-university-of-michigan-survey-jkdORhpGIIJ5boHDAAz0).

&gt; U.S. consumer sentiment rose in early August, continuing its climb from a record low earlier this summer as inflation expectations improved.
&gt; 
&gt; The preliminary August estimate of the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index, which surveys consumer attitudes on the state of the economy, **rose 3.6 index points to 55.1 [vs. FactSet consensus estimate of 52.3] from a July reading of 51.5.** Consumer sentiment has increased since **dropping to 50 in June—the lowest reading on records dating back to 1952.**
&gt; 
&gt; Future inflation expectations improved but remained elevated, according to the report. **The median expected year-ahead inflation rate fell to 5%,** the lowest since February. And **median long-run inflation expectations held steady at 3%**, a rate above inflation ahead of the pandemic.
&gt; 
&gt; A significant portion of consumers, near **48%, continue to blame inflation** for eroding living standards. Higher-income people, for example, said household finances were down and that they had less to spend on big-ticket items.
&gt; 
&gt; U.S. consumer inflation remained close to a four-decade high in July but eased slightly to an 8.5% annual pace, a modest slowdown driven by a decline in energy prices that was led by a steep decline in gasoline prices.
&gt; 
&gt; “The slowdown in inflation is probably constructive for consumer sentiment,” said Aditya Bhave, U.S. and global economist at Bank of America.
&gt; 
&gt; Prices for gasoline and food, compared with other expenses, can have a disproportionate effect on inflation expectations because consumers spend on these categories more frequently, Mr. Bhave said. **The average price of a gallon of unleaded gasoline in the U.S. this week fell below $4 in August for the first time since March**.
&gt; 
&gt; “Lower prices at the pump, combined with potential cresting in annual inflation measures, should allow sentiment to gradually ascend in the months ahead from its record low set in June,” Mahir Rasheed, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in an analyst note.
&gt; Gasoline prices can have a disproportionate effect on inflation expectations, which eased in the latest University of Michigan survey.
&gt; 
&gt; The University of Michigan report joined a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey released Monday showing that inflation expectations fell in July. The Fed believes that expectations influence inflation’s future path as workers demand raises to offset inflation and businesses feel more comfortable raising prices.
&gt; 
&gt; **Despite low levels of sentiment, households have continued to spend solidly**, a disconnect that Mr. Bhave said should eventually resolve. “At some point, that’s got to resolve and I think the popular view is that eventually spending will slow down in line with sentiment,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; **Retail sales rose 1% in June**, as shoppers weathered higher prices for goods that rose in price, including groceries and furniture. Consumers also spent more at restaurants.
&gt; 
&gt; The Commerce Department is set to release July retail sales numbers on Wednesday. “It’ll give us a really good view into the trajectory of the consumer going into the third quarter,” Mr. Bhave said.

-------

My separate comment: this metric is increasingly useless in predicting the state of the consumer if at 3.9% unemployment and expectations of 3% inflation over the next 5 years, the sentiment is worse than the worst of '08."|0.82|7|0|7

t3_wmn4gb|1660315732|stocks|I bought Movado. How and Why?|"**Introduction**

I was recently blessed when my holdings in Ocean Bio-Chem (DL: $OBCI) were bought out by One Water Marine (NASDAQ: $ONEW) for $13.08/share.  That gave me a nice 40%+ return.  The question was how to put that money into good use in the small cap growth space. To my surprise, I found Movado Group Inc (NYSE: $MOV). The reason I said I was surprised was because it has a current yield (TTM) of 3.85%, which would make it more of a dividend play.

**About Movado Group**

Movado Group, Inc. designs, sources, markets, and distributes watches worldwide. The company operates in two segments, Watch and Accessory Brands, and Company Stores. It offers its watches under the Movado, Concord, Ebel, Olivia Burton, and MVMT brands, as well as licensed brands, such as Coach, Tommy Hilfiger, HUGO BOSS, Lacoste, Calvin Klein, and Scuderia Ferrari. The company also provides after-sales and shipping services. Its customers include jewelry store chains, department stores, independent regional jewelers, network of independent distributors, online marketplaces, licensors' retail stores, and third-party e-commerce retailers. The company also sells directly to consumers through its e-commerce platforms. As of January 31, 2022, it operated 51 retail outlet locations. The company was formerly known as North American Watch Corporation and changed its name to Movado Group, Inc. in 1996. Movado Group, Inc. was founded in 1961 and is based in Paramus, New Jersey. (Source: Portfolio123)

**Key Statistics**

* Price = $36.19/share
* 52 Week Range = $29.95 - $48.66
* Market Cap = $832.873M
* Beta = 1.16
* PE Ratio = 8.53
* PS Ratio = 1.13
* Dividend Yield = 3.85%
* Source: Yahoo Finance

**Financial Health**

Before I look at any company, there is the issue of the financial health of the business. I have several non-negotiables when it comes to investing, and I always insist on a clean balance sheet. Here are a few measures that lead one to believe that Movado is a well run company.

* Altman-Z score = 4.87
* Beneish M-Score = -2.66
* Debt-to-Equity = 0.19
* Current Ratio = 3.79
* Quick Ratio = 2.59
* Free Cash Flow = $118.50M
* Source: Financial Statements from Movado

**Growth Prospects**

Movado offers watches for $100 up to $10,000 per piece.  For some younger people, their brands are the first luxury watch they buy. The company continues to offer these various price points so no one can feel left out.  Their smartwatch technology continues to improve, so they will have a presence in that space too.  Based on historical trends, these are the regressed growth rates:

* Sales Growth = 18.94%
* EPS Growth = 67.97%
* Dividend Growth = 17.3%

Since the EPS Growth, along with the historical PE ratios, are skewed due to Covid-19, it is decided to determine a fair price for Movado based on revenue growth.  Additionally, since the thesis is to focus on Movado as a growth prospect, I will sparingly use a dividend model for my evaluation

**Cash Flow Analysis Based on Sales Growth**

Here are the numbers that I will use determine a fair price for Movado:

* Sales Growth 18.94%
* PS Low = 0.39
* PS High = 2.00
* PS Average = 1.12
* Revenue/Share = $32.86
* Historical Beta = 0.99
* Required Rate of Return = 9.95%

Using these metrics, a fair present value just based on sales for Movado would range between $18.98-$97.36, with an average of $54.52. Given its current price, Movado is clearly undervalued.

**Cash Flow Analysis Based on Dividend Growth**

Given that Movado's dividend growth of 17.3% (ignoring 2020) is well above the required rate of return of 9.95%, I used a valuation for supernormal growth rates.  I come up with a present value of $36.89/share, which puts Movado as a fairly priced security based on its historical yield.

**How I Played Movado**

I bought 150 shares of Movado at $36.53/share.  Additionally, I sold a December Call with a strike price of $40 for a profit of $2.90/share. If Movado hits the strike price of $40 in December, I will have a total profit of $6.37/share for one round lot, and a profit margin of 17.4%. As long as the price remains above $34.60/share, I will remain profitable, and that doesn't take into account the $1.40/share annual dividend that stands to grow.

Investors shouldn't be too uplifted by signs of cooling inflation: the Federal Reserve likely won't slow down their rate-hiking regime because the economy is still strong enough to take more monetary tightening, top economist Mohamed El-Erian said.

Instead of pulling back, the central is going to have to ""consolidate its gains,"" he said in an interview on CNBC, noting the July consumer price index came in better than expectations. ""They can't celebrate.""

Indeed, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Wednesday that it was too early to ""declare victory"" on inflation.

""I think the Fed is going to welcome the latest print, but it's not going to slow down in any significant manner,"" El-Erian said.

He expects the next Fed rate hike to be ""somewhere between"" 50 and 75 basis points, saying that's still substantial given that the last two increases were 75 points. 

The July CPI report that showed cooling inflation as well as last week's payroll report that showed 528,000 new jobs were added last month indicate that Fed policymakers ""can continue doing what they're doing because the underlying strength of the economy is still significant."""|0.93|493|0|493

The companies, which also include Aluminium Corporation of China (Chalco) [**(601600.SS)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/601600.SS), PetroChina [**(601857.SS)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/601857.SS) and Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Co [**(600688.SS)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/600688.SS), said in separate statements that they would apply for delistings of their American Depository Shares from later this month. The five, which were added to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA) list in May after they were identified as not meeting U.S regulators' auditing standards, will keep their listings in Hong Kong and mainland Chinese markets. There was no mention of the auditing row in separate statements by the Chinese companies outlining their moves, which come amid heightened tensions after last week's visit to Taiwan by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi."|0.97|1418|0|1418

However, it's mostly about the FED stop purchasing long term bonds, and letting the free market decide what is the rate.

The FED is creating this entire show around interest rates in order to keep everyone focusing on that, instead of focusing on its BRUTAL intervention in the long term bond market.

This intervention is the significant part in holding the market from falling, since once the FED stops buying all these long term bonds, their rates will rise DRAMATICALLY.

This allows the FED to hike rates without TOTALLY COLLAPSING the long term bond market and the housing market with it immediately.

Although it started reducing its purchasing of long term bonds, the FED is doing it EXTREMELY SLOW, while running the ""short term interst rate"" show like it is the most important thing.

Obviously, the media and all of us are totally hypnotized by the FED interest rate show, just like a hypnotized person looking at the pendulum in hypnosis show.

And all of this is in order to show that the FED is fighting inflation.

SHOW TIME will arrive when the FED really pulls out its sticky fingers from the bond market.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

t3_wmgje9|1660295008|stocks|Tiger 21, an exclusive club of investors, says the ultra rich are doubling down on stocks|"The members of Tiger 21 – a peer network of ultra-high net worth entrepreneurs and investors – are putting most of their money to work in the stock market for the first time.

Tiger 21 consists of 1,200 members with a cumulative $140 billion in assets, and individuals must have at least $20 million in liquid assets to qualify for membership.

Its founder and chairman, Michael Sonnenfeldt, told CNBC on Thursday that although real estate had historically been the most popular destination for members’ money, they were now seeing some “real bargains” in the stock markets.

This has, in part, pushed public equities to the No. 1 spot for Tiger 21 for the first time since the network’s inception.

Sonnenfeldt said members are not focused on stock picking for the most part, so much of the equity investment is channeled into ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and index trackers, while technology has been among the most popular sectors. Public equities now constitute 27% of the membership’s overall asset allocation.

“You have a lot of the FAANGs that have come in from much higher prices — they are thinking there is a lot of benefit there, and obviously one of the big areas is energy, not only on the oil and gas side, but much bigger growing interest in renewables and how to play the solar opportunities, the wind opportunities,” Sonnenfeldt told CNBC’s “Street Signs Europe.”

“They know this is the biggest investment theme perhaps in human history, and it is getting a lot of their attention.”

After a dismal first half of the year on the back of soaring inflation, tightening monetary policy and recession fears, stock markets have staged a relief rally in recent weeks, and received a further boost Wednesday after U.S. inflation was shown to have cooled in July on the back of a fall in oil prices.

Many investors have increased their cash holdings to weather a likely recession. Sonnenfeldt said the cash allocation of Tiger 21 members has historically held solid at an unusually high 12%.

This is because they are primarily “wealth preservers” who have sold businesses and live on roughly 2% of their net worth, and therefore use cash reserves to shore up around five years of living expenses, he said.

In the short term, Tiger 21 noted that members are using their ample cash to look for deals and inflation hedges.

“But they also want resources to pounce on an opportunity and they have been seeing them in increasing numbers, so their cash actually just ticked down from 12% to 11%. It may sound like a small amount, but it probably suggests that members are quite bullish over the long term,” Sonnenfeldt said.

“They have recession fears — a majority of our members think that we are going into recession — and still between real estate, public equity and private equity, it is a 76% allocation, so that is pretty confident in the long term.”"|0.82|356|0|356

Below is only the first part of the article

**Liquidia Corp (LQDA)**

**Price: $5.90**

**Shares Outstanding: 64M**

**Market Cap: $320M**

**Cash: $70M (Only used 70% of cash balance – not profitable)**

**LT Debt: $24M**

**EV: $274M**

&amp;#x200B;

The complicated nature of this special situation resulted in this analysis being longer than my normal posts. Therefore I wanted to include a quick summary of the analysis. While this situation is inherently complicated, the thesis itself is fairly straight forward. Liquidia is currently in a Hatch-Waxman litigation after their competitor, United Therapeutics, filed a lawsuit against them in 2020, claiming that Liquidia was infringing on three of their patents. In 2021, Liquidia received tentative FDA approval for their product Yutrepia, pending the outcome of the patent dispute. Roughly two years later, we are now close to the dispute being resolved, with the decision expected to be handed down between August and the end of October. While it’s difficult to probability weigh the outcome, I do believe Liquidia will receive a favorable court ruling and will therefore be able to launch Yutrepia in 4Q2022.

Both Liquidia and United are focused on pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). United pretty much has a monopoly on PAH (group 1) patients &amp; PH-ILD (group 3) patients, and Liquidia is now looking to enter this market with their new product Yutrepia. United’s product, Tyvaso, did 607M in revenue in 2021, and looks to do roughly 800M this year.

That’s revenue from group 1 and group 3 combined. The TAM for group 1 and 3 combined, is roughly 5.3B – a massive market. Liquidia also has the superior product, and so they could possibly take significant market share from United. Given Liquidia’s 320M market cap, and them possibly entering a 5.3B market with the superior product, a favorable decision by the district court could result in a significant rerating of the company. Overall, I believe this situation offers a very attractive risk/reward profile at the current price.

**Brief Business Overview**

Liquidia Corp is a biopharmaceutical company focused on pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH is a rare, chronic, progressive disease caused by hardening and narrowing of the pulmonary arteries that can lead to right heart failure and eventually death, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of approximately 30,000 patients. The company’s proprietary PRINT engineering technology allows them to engineer and manufacture highly uniform drug particles with precise control over the size, three-dimensional geometric shape and chemical composition of the particles. As a result, the company has been able to develop their main drug candidate Yutrepia (treprostinil) inhalation powder, which is an inhaled dry powder formulation of treprostinil delivered through a proven, convenient, palm-sized device.

The company also has a commercially approved product named Treprostinil Injection. The Liquidia PAH subsidiary (formerly RareGen) commercializes generic Treprostinil Injection in a partnership with Sandoz. Treprostinil Injection is most likely nothing more than a $15-25M revenue product at 80% gross margin. In other words, it might provide some flexibility in terms of near term capital needs, but nothing more.

The PAH market currently has one dominant player, Liquidia’s only competitor - United Therapeutics (UTHR). UTHR sells Tyvaso, a nebulized form of treprostinil along with a few other versions of the same drug which are administered via infusion. Tyvaso did 607M in revenue in 2021 and looks to be doing 800M in 2022. That’s for group 1 and group 3 patients combined. As mentioned above, Liquidia's drug, Yutrepia, is an inhaled version of treprostinil targeting Tyvaso's current market. An inhaled version of treprostinil is better than a nebulized version - nebulized treprostinil requires a clunky device with 10-13 parts while inhaled treprostinil only requires an inhaler. That’s why UTHR is coming out with their own inhaled product, Tyvaso DPI, through a partnership with MannKind Corporation.

**Timeline And Development of The Lawsuit**

On June 5th, 2020, Liquidia’s only competitor – United Therapeutics Corporation – filed a lawsuit against Liquidia for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,604,901 (the '901 patent) and 9,593,066 (the '066 patent) relating to United Therapeutics' product Tyvaso (treprostinil) Inhalation Solution. The lawsuit came as a result of Liquidia filing their NDA for the approval of LIQ861 – now known as Yutrepia. Upon initiation of the lawsuit, the FDA triggered a statutory regulatory stay on the final approval of Yutrepia until October 27, 2022, or earlier resolution or settlement of the ongoing litigation.

On July 24th, 2020, UTHR filed an amended complaint asserting infringement of U.S. Patent No. 10,716,793 (‘793) in addition to the already asserted infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. ’901 and ’066. However, the ‘793 patent was not subject to the FDA’s regulatory stay because it was not listed in the Orange Book for Tyvaso when Liquidia submitted the NDA for Yutrepia.

In October, 2020, LQDA provided an update on the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board Decision on Inter Partes Review (IPR) of two of United’s Tyvaso patents. The update explained how PTAB had instituted IPR on patent ‘901, but denied institution on patent ‘066. This update meant that the 30 month stay would still be in effect, and that LQDA would have to argue invalidity and non-infringement in the district court regarding patent ‘066.

I wanted to briefly explain the difference between the district court, where the trial was held, and the PTAB, as they do two different things. The PTAB IPR is filed by LQDA to review patentability of claims in the patent, while cases filed by UTHR go to the district court to argue LQDA infringes (though LQDA can either argue invalidity or non-infringement as defense). For the PTAB to review a patent, one or more claims have to be unpatentable.

Fast forward to August 2021, the PTAB instituted an IPR proceeding against the ‘793 patent. A couple of months later, in October 2021, the PTAB ruled in Liquidia’s favor in the IPR proceeding against the ‘901 patent. In its ruling, the PTAB found that seven of the nine claims were unpatentable. Only the narrower dependent claims 6 and 7 remain, both of which require actual storage at ambient temperature of treprostinil sodium.

On November 5, 2021, the FDA issued a tentative approval for Yutrepia (treprostinil) inhalation powder, which is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to improve exercise ability in adult patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms. What this means is that if the PTAB and/or the district court rules in Liquidia’s favor, the approval will no longer be tentative, and they can launch Yutrepia right away.

December 2021: The Court grants LQDA leave to file a motion for summary judgment of invalidity of the ‘066 and ‘901 patents due to collateral estoppel. Trial in the Hatch-Waxman litigation is scheduled for March 28-30, 2022. Later that month, on December 29th, UTHR filed a stipulation of partial judgment with respect to the ‘901 patent. Under the stipulation of partial judgment, UTHR agreed to the entry of judgment of Liquidia’s non-infringement of the ’901 patent based on the Court’s construction of certain terms in the patent. With this stipulation of partial judgment, only the ‘066 patent would serve as a basis for the on-going regulatory stay for final approval of Yutrepia (treprostinil) inhalation powder by the FDA.

That brings us to July 22nd, 2022, the PTAB rules in Liquidia’s favor in IPR proceeding against patent ‘793. In its ruling, the PTAB found that, based on the preponderance of the evidence, all the claims of the ’793 patent have been shown to be unpatentable.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I think at this point, my conclusion is that while it’s hard to probability weigh the outcome of the trial, the risk/reward is favorable enough that it’s worth taking a position, for me. In the short term you get a risk reward profile of 75-80% downside with 200%+ upside. For what it’s worth, I do also think the odds of getting a favorable ruling is in Liquidia’s favor. It’s just difficult to determine how much in Liquidia’s favor the odds are. Furthermore, given that the outcome is favorable, not only do you get the possibility of 200% immediate upside, you also get a clear path to a much higher return than the 200%, over the long term. In fact, the IRR’s could get silly high."|0.8|20|0|20
t3_wmcrxy|1660281254|stocks|Investment DISCUSSION: Aluminium|"  Hi,

Not an investment recommendation or advice, just some conversation. I am a Macro geek but not so much a stock picker..

Aluminium market is in structurally in deficit as demand has been above production. It already was the case in 2021 and is expected to be the case in 2022, 23, 24, 25 and going forward. In addition, LME stocks are at the lowest level since 2000... 

Recession is coming, according to most experts. I don't challenge the rational, but it seems to be quite priced in commodity markets and economy is not a science (in other terms, there is no determinism like in physics and they could be 'very' wrong). 

Aluminium production is energy intensive: it is estimated (by legitimate banks) that the median cost of production lies at $2,300. Current price is $2,500. The 50% median cost has historically acted as a support to the Al price. 

The median cost is that high because of the energy cost (Aluminium smelting is extremely energy intensive), and I expect (personal view) energy costs to remain elevated in Europe. At current prices, a large part of the production (already in deficit) is at made at a loss. In consequence, more production will be curtailed, and the deficit should worsen. In Europe, electricity prices went up 10-20 fold! (Realize that...) Even Alcoa has some plants producing at a loss, there is no interest for them to feed the market with more supply at a loss, generating a local loss and lower prices globally. 

CONCLUSION:

Supply-Demand rebalance should lead to higher prices. European smelters should be the first to cut production leading to higher prices. American smelters should benefit from higher prices, relative lower costs: Higher margins. 

CAVEAT

There are large regional premiums that bump the price (+$600 in the US, +$550 in Europe). It could also be seen as physical market tightness. 

TANGIBLE MARKET IDEA FOR DISCUSSION Just in case the Market has its pricing correct (recession), I prefer to play it in equities, either outright or medium/LT out the money calls.

Century Aluminium (CENX) is an American Smelter. Despite high energy costs, it should do better than its European peers. It is currently trading at $10, after a recent low of $7. In Q2, volume disappointed but it generates solid net income after several years of loss. To be clear, the company was in bad situation, but if the market behaves (my thesis above) the stock would move from a ""distressed sort of company valuation"" to a cash maker value stock. 

HONNEST ACKOWLEDGMENTS: I am more of a Macro guy and less of a Stock expert. I am seeking advice here as CENX shut down one location in the US due to high Energy costs (still, it has recently generated profits as a company and is compatible with all the above). But: 1) why have they shut down a US plant before the numerous cash burners in Europe? (Maybe hedging makes some Euro company still profitable, but this would be temporary) 

2) Do you see another company in a better position to benefit from this environment?

My objective is to backtest an investment in SPY that was lump-summed once. For example, if I invested $10K in SPY on 1st May 1988, AND (this is a big AND) the SPY components stay the same as of 1stMay1988 until today, that means if a ticker was removed after the date, we continue to backtest its performance, and we ignore tickers added after that date. 

I believe I need the following data:

1. List of SP500 components on any one date
2. Weight of these 500 tickers on that date

With these data, I can do individual backtest then weight them accordingly. 

Why am I doing this? Admittedly this has no financial value because it doesn't replicate real life scenario. However I strongly believe in cycle and balance, which means what goes up must come down etc etc, and SPY is the only one that is always going up, perhaps it is due its components and weights keep changing, so I just want to scratch this itch."|0.69|9|0|9

I’ve been watching closely and I think we’re headed to another shockingly low number.

The last headline inflation number was announced at 8.5% YoY, down from 9.1% the month previous, and with the optimistic estimates of 8.7%.

During this time, up until the last day before the data release, the Cleveland Fed nowcast estimated July’s inflation at 8.82%, so they likely overestimate figures.

I’m not sure what August’s forecast is, if somebody knows it please chime in, but my point is this: Cleveland Fed nowcast for August is currently at 8.38% and dropping daily. You can see a screenshot of their daily adjustments here: https://imgur.com/a/jL0cfKG

Another huge factor in this is oil prices dropping, heavily affecting inflation numbers. The only reason oil went down was because OPEC increase of oil supply; something that we’ve recently agreed to continue and even push harder. Notably, not all countries met OPEC expectations on the increases in the last month, so there’s even more room for improvement than this second increase implies.

My only concerns are that the market might be scared by a potentially inevitable 0.75% increase by the Fed, as they look past the fluff and tackle real inflation. Regardless, we’re not worried about a 1% increase anymore, inflation numbers will be very good on the next report, and there’s a chance (though unlikely) that the Fed does a 0.5% increase instead of a 0.75%, which would be insanely bullish for markets."|0.73|29|0|29

t3_wm2658|1660251704|stocks|Can the market really annualize 10%?|"I know everyone talks about long term investing and for the last 100 years the S&amp;P has returned something like 10% annualized. But when I think about my retirement future, for some reason I just highly doubt it. 

For example, if I have 30-35 years or so left until retirement and the S&amp;P returned 10% (obviously there’s ups and downs) 

That would make the S&amp;P 70,000-118,000 per share. I just don’t see it happening like at all. 

My thought is I’d be lucky if I see 4-6% a year compounding for the next 30-35 years. 

Thoughts on the S&amp;P being 70,000-118,000 a share in 30-35 years?"|0.87|504|0|504

t3_wm06ll|1660246701|stocks|Uber the stock to own|"After losing hundreds of millions of dollars and profitably being questioned by investors, with rising rates and a recession risk looming investors sold the stock, dropping to a low of 19.90, recently the company reversed the course and I think will change the trajectory of the stock, a huge beat on earnings, revenues surging 105% y/y, and the first positive ebitda quarter ever, with profitably expected in Q4 and record bookings, revenue also expected, all whole trading at 50% discount to the highs of 2021. 
Gig economy stocks have been largely speculation, giving up profit for outsized growth burning through billions, ABNB, LYFT, UBER, all in a new segment for the economy.
Revenues climbed double digits in all geographical regions, ride sharing made up a majority of the upside, followed by Eats, and lastly Freight, an acquisition made in 2021 which has been doing very well with a lot of growth, but still making up a very small percentage of revenues.
I think Uber is the clear leader when looking between the rivals Uber and Lyft, with a positive cash flow expected this year, and record growth, but I also believe that Uber is in the best position to take advantage of self driving technology, which I think was also a big reasoning the hype for the IPO was so big, but even more so now since Freight is growing at a larger rate, as well as growing into 400,000 new gig workers.
The downside risks are apparent, inability to bring profitably or a breakdown of revenues could drop the stock by 50% in line with LYFT performance over the past 6 months. 
The risk of recession weighs on the stock but recent indicators show we may avoid the worst of any recession to come.
If they can continue to grow you can see Uber surpass all time highs of 60$, right now Uber is trading at it's best valuation ever in my opinion, I've avoided the stock for years and watched the speculation run wild but with profitably coming soon I see now as the best risk reward, as well as solid execution by management.
I believe Tesla if they achieve self driving will be best to partner with Uber to scale the technology, I also believe Uber  is a safer stock to own at a better valuation that Tesla.

Uber seems very undervalued, I know 2021 was insane for growth stocks but Uber is trading at twice the revenue, ebitda positive cash flow, profitability by q4 22 and expects even more growth in the quarters ahead with double digit growth in every geographical segment.

I intend to keep buying more calls to keep my exposure to my portfolio at under 5% and take advantage of what I believe is an undervalued stock. My target for 2023 is 80$.

t3_wlxrow|1660240660|stocks|Village Supermarket: Regional Store Operator|"TLDR at bottom

Market Cap: $325.74MM
Share Price: $22.52      

	VLGE.A is a regional player located in New Jersey that operates 38 stores consisting of: 30 grocery stores, 5 Fairway Markets, and 3 Gourmet Garage Specialty Markets. 
	 Its stores feature specialty departments, such as an on-site bakery, an expanded delicatessen, various natural and organic foods, ethnic and international foods, prepared foods, and pharmacies. This allows it to have a good brand connection and sense of local connection in its relatively high population density area of Northern New Jersey which gives it a competitive advantage to Walmarts not only because of its larger offering such as bakeries and restaurants making it half-mall, half-supermarket, but also a really strong brand image.
	It is not the fastest to expand and is actually under-leveraged, even as a small player in the industry and the region, though it did announce a 15-20 million dollar project for a retail center in which it will retain a 30% interest with a Village store also.
	
I have been talking a little much about the business since it is fairly simple, but lets get to the financials:

	Revenues have been 2.07B in the LTM with operating margins of 1.8% lower than the 2.1% average pre-COVID, though higher than the 1.6-1.7% levels from April of 2020 to July of 2021.
	FCF margin for the LTM is at 1.2% though that is primarily due to seasonality and the average hovers around 1.4% - 1.7%, with the FCF in dollar amount being $24.2MM.

	Though a 7.5% TTM FCF yield is in itself pretty good, we can not simply look at that in isolation and we have to acknowledge that though Food and Staples Retail has been particularly volatile in the last 6 months due to supply chain issues, inflation, and other macro challenges resulting in problems, especially INVENTORY MISMANAGEMENT.

	Well lucky for us, inventory turnover ratio has been increasing 3% annually for the last 6 years for VLGE.A, even through post-COVID macro challenges and inventory itself has risen at a steady and reasonable rate with gross margins actually increasing, compensating inflation challenges.

Moving onto to the balance sheet, being under-leveraged means that ROA &amp; ROE are slightly lower than industry averages with ROA of 2.6% and industry of 3.5-4% and ROE of 6.6% and industry of 17.4%. But the upside to this is that stocks like Village trade closer to their equity value and in this case, TBV is 337.39 or P/TBV of 0.97 and BV of 361.58 and P/BV of 0.9.

	Though I won’t go deep in their balance sheet, they have 120M in cash, 44M in LT investments, 560MM in NET PP&amp;E
On the assets side and 70M in LT debt and 300M in leases on the liability side. Though all of this already looks pretty great, what I love most about their balance sheet is that they have 225M in current assets and 153M in current liabilities or a current ratio of almost 1.5x with half of current assets being in cash which is good for any company, amazing for a food and staples retail company where the industry average is 1.1x and the big players hover around 0.8x-1x.

Going onto the valuation, though they are under-leveraged, they love to expand and invest in themselves through capital expenditure which has resulted in average equity annual growth of 5.3% over 15 years and revenue CAGR of of 4.2% over that time with GDP being 3.5%.

Did i forget to mention that they have been paying a 1 dollar per share dividend annually for the last 15 year. Now yes, i understand a no growth dividend isn’t the best but it is a yield of 4.44% with the BBB bond effective yield being 4.85% with likely not as strong equity value for those triple B companies.

Along with this they repurchased 1% of shares in the last quarter. and have an authorization to repurchase 1.66% of shares more.

Just to note, insider ownership is at a good 12.8% and 7% of shares being owned by ones of the directors and founders.

I believe that it should be trading at least above $30. I think a 1.5x TBV would be a fair valuation at a price of $35 or a 5% FCF yield considering its incredibly risk—averse and stable business. Also, i did a DCF model with a TGR of 2% and DR of 10% giving a $33 intrinsic value though i believe that is very Conservative given they have been able to grow 4.2% and have a WACC of 3.084% and have a weighted average interest rate on LLT debt of of roughly 2.4%.

I also think this is a great stock for anyone who needs the dividend income considering the history of payout and the low beta of 0.17.

TLDR: stable food and staple retailer with strong regional brand value that is under leveraged and has continuously invested Into the business through expansion, Acquisition, and returning value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and has a large margin of safety/discount to intrinsic value."|0.63|2|0|2
