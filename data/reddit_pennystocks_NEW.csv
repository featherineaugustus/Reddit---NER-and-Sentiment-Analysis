t3_xcqwf5|1663023500|pennystocks|New Oil Sands Bitumen Technology Coming Online|"In a world desperately in need of more and better energy sources, areas like the oil sands of northern Alberta play a crucial and controversial role in the energy supply puzzle. Processing the heavy, tar-like crude bitumen extracted from these sands into more transportable and refineable synthetic crude oil (SCO) is a necessary step on the way from the fields to the refineries. It’s called upgrading, and the current technologies used in the process are either very expensive or not very efficient.

[Aduro Clean Technologies Inc.](https://adurocleantech.com/) (CSE: ACT) (OTCQB: ACTHF) (FSE: 9D50) [recently announced](https://adurocleantech.com/company-update/aduro-announces-readiness-of-scaled-up-continuous-flow-bitumen-reactor-for-customer-trials/) the imminent completion of its pilot-scale Hydrochemolytic™ continuous flow bitumen reactor. The company’s [Hydrochemolytic™ platform](https://adurocleantech.com/hbu/) is a patented, water-based technology that operates more efficiently and less expensively than the current methods for upgrading bitumen. Hydrochemolytic technology also has applications that could [revolutionize plastic recycling](https://adurocleantech.com/hpu/) and other upgrading processes that[ turn wasted renewable oils](https://adurocleantech.com/hru/) like corn and canola into renewable products like biojet fuel. Here we will focus on the technology’s potential impact on the oil refinery industry. 

**Bitumen Upgrading 101**

The bitumen that comes out of Alberta’s oil sands and similar deposits around the world can be used close to its ‘natural’ tarry state for paving and roofing applications. It contains high levels of asphaltenes and similar compounds that make it very heavy, and unable to be transported via pipeline. To make it into the lighter SCO, bitumen can be upgraded by either removing carbon or adding hydrogen. Carbon is removed by coking - high temperatures are applied to bitumen to crack it into lighter oils and natural gas liquids while also creating a solid, carbon-rich byproduct called coke. Coking units can cost in the $500 million to $1 billion range to build.

Hydrogen is added through hydroconversion, an upgrading process where the bitumen is cracked and combined with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, such as platinum, at high pressures. As hydrogen is added to the bitumen, with no carbon rejection, the volume of synthetic crude oil produced from hydroconversion could be equal or more than the volume of bitumen consumed during the process. Hydroconversion is both more expensive and more complex than coking while producing higher yields.

In 2020, there were [four active upgraders](https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/market-snapshots/2022/market-snapshot-a-tour-of-canadas-oil-sands-upgraders.html) in Alberta and two nearby in Saskatchewan. These facilities processed 42% of the 3 million barrels/day of Alberta bitumen produced that year, yielding 1.1 million barrels/day of SCO. The economics of building and expanding upgrading facilities have become increasingly problematic, and oil sand production is still on the upswing.

**The Aduro Difference**

Aduro’s patented Hydrochemolytic™ platform utilizes a water-based chemical conversion process with a number of advantages over the systems widely used today. The technology is highly scalable and significantly less expensive to build than the coking and hydroconversion facilities noted above. It also operates at a lower temperature, with lower energy needs, while greatly reducing the need for dilutive hydrocarbon substances in the upgrading process. Hydrochemolytic™ processing also results in greatly reduced emissions, making the oil produced ‘greener’ than that created by conventional methods. It can even be applied to the lowest grade bitumen left over from these conventional methods in refineries, essentially turning waste into a much higher value and usable oil.

In the current stage of development, Aduro is completing its R2 Bitumen reactor on a pilot scale. The company has been building to this moment, with [previous accomplishments](https://adurocleantech.com/company-update/aduro-completed-work-on-its-first-milestone-and-submitted-a-report-for-third-party-evaluation-a-critical-step-towards-commercialization-of-their-innovative-chemical-conversion-technologies/) including the implementation and testing of small-scale batch reactors (R1) and the testing of a pre-pilot R2 continuous flow reactor. The continuous flow approach marked a significant leap forward from the initial batch-by-batch R1 reactors.

“Results achieved with the continuous-flow R2 pre-pilot reactor exceeded expectations. Compared to batch mode, it delivered equivalent upgrading results more quickly and at lower temperatures, and with lower catalyst loading. We had already proven HCT in small-scale R1 batch reactors, but the efficiency of HCT in R2 increased by a factor far greater than 10. This significantly strengthens our projections regarding lower operating costs in commercial applications, along with improved scoring on environmental factors, such as reduced emissions and energy consumption,” said Marc Trygstad, CTO of Aduro.

The pilot project is slated to be fully operational by the end of October or so, and features an upgraded vapor-liquid separator that increases the technology’s versatility in terms of what types of feedstock it can handle. In anticipation of demand for customer trials, Aduro is [significantly upgrading its lab facilities and testing capabilities](https://adurocleantech.com/investor-relations/aduro-expands-and-upgrades-lab-facilities-to-accelerate-research-and-scale-up-capabilities/) to make the trials as efficient and effective as possible. 

**Where It’s All Headed**

Aduro Clean Technologies is at an interesting inflection point in its corporate development. The R2 Bitumen reactor allows the company to move into its commercialization and revenue generation phase, pending the outcome of customer trials. Aduro is already well down the road with an unnamed publicly traded company on a potential asphaltene upgrading project, and the pilot-scale reactor will allow the companies to complete the evaluation of the potential deal. 

On a parallel track, [Aduro is working on a pilot-scale R2 plastics reactor](http://www.secfilings.com/news/the-many-harms-of-plastic-and-how-to-invest-in-a-solution-408). Expected to be completed later this year, the pilot project should get the company’s plastic recycling program to a similar point of development as the bitumen project - on the verge of commercialization and revenue generation.

Both opportunities represent massive market potential for Aduro and its patented Hydrochemolytic™ platform with a combined total addressable market of over $100 billion in North America alone. If the technology proves itself on a larger scale in these pilot projects, the revenue generation could make its current \~$36 million market cap look silly. Stay tuned for further developments."|0.75|4|0|4

With that being said, I am going to briefly go over their current facilities and what they have planned.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you mean by *facilities*?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, my curious friend, I mean to say the company's Core Projects where the actual activity takes place (the Anaerobic Digestive (AD) process and any additional upgrading).

&amp;#x200B;

**Core Project 1: Net Zero Waste Abbotsford (NZWA) - Operational Organics Processing Facility**

&gt;\- Current capacity: 40K tonnes/yr  
\- Expansion to: 135K tonnes/yr  
\- RNG: 180K tonnes/yr  
\- 20 yr FortisBC Offtake Secured  
\- Long-lead items secured  
\- Construction of an AD --&gt; blended feedback from agricultural, municipal, and commercial organic waste

&amp;#x200B;

**Core Project 2: Fraser Valley Biogas (FVB) - Operational RNG Facility**

&gt;\- Current capacity: 50K tonnes/yr  
\- RNG (2020): 80K GJ/yr  
\- Expansion: 100K tonnes/yr  
\- RNG: 160K GJ/yr  
\- Existing FortisBC Offtake (w/10 yr history)  
\- Processes farm and non-farm organic waste to energy  
\- AD facility w/blended feedstock from agricultural and commercial organic waste

&amp;#x200B;

**Core Project 3: Sea to Sky Soils (SSS) - Operational Organics Processing Facility**

&gt;\- Current cap: 40K tonnes/yr  
\- Expansion to: 60K tonnes/yr  
\- Application submitted to expand permitted capacity  
\- Existing compost facility operated in partnership w/Lil'wat First Nation --&gt; feedstock from municipal and agricultural waste

&amp;#x200B;

**Core Project 4: GrowTec (67% of Operational RNG facility)**

&gt;\- Phase 1 Capacity: 80K GJ/yr  
\- Expansion to: 140K GJ/yr  
\- Phase 1 development, phase 2 expansion planned  
\- Operating farm scale AD that converts biodegradable waste into biogas  
\- RNG offtake contracted with FortisBC

&amp;#x200B;

The main takeaway here is the company seems to have a robust handle on operations with a clear pathway to growth. This is clearly an infrastructure heavy business model that requires complex inputs and produces complex outputs. As well, the output (RNG) has a current demand that will only accelerate supported by government mandates to shift to RNG consumption over traditional natural gas. However, it seems to be offset by the ability to use existing infrastructure which allows for scaling as well as a world leading team that is well versed in these disciplines."|0.5|0|0|0

* Bentley Lake: 3 claims, 12,397 ha
* Mozzie Lake: 3 claims, 6,908 ha

**An odd, yet bullish turn for uranium**

Giant **Cameco Corporation** ([**CCJ**](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/CCJ/overview)) recently had a very large number of call options purchased that are out-of-the-money. This activity indicates an investor or group of investors are very bullish on the uranium mining company's prospects. Investors may end up jumping on the bandwagon, even though the stock is already up over 15% in the last month.

As investors can see, the shares popped on significant volume over the last few days. Technically, the purchase of large numbers of out-of-the-money call options in major uranium shares of Cameco (CCJ) over the last few days, which has fueled a run in the sector.

*The first tranche for 22,667 (call options) would have cost $3.173 million (i.e., 22,667 calls x $1.40 x 100), which is 224 times the regular open interest (amount of contracts normally held). The investor(s) was willing to pay this with the assumption that CCJ stock will keep rising quite significantly over the next 3 months. The strike price at $37.00 is 28.38% over today's price. So the investors put up a substantial sum believing CCJ will move up 29% by Dec. 16.*

*The second tranche has a lower hurdle. The investor(s) believe the stock will rise over 7.6% from today to $31.00 per share. They likely paid $6.83 million for 22,774 call options at the $3.00 mid-price for the options. This resulted in 62 times the normal open interest in the stock. (*Barchart*)*

Uranium has had a lot of ink lately as energy supply/demand roils. With situation in Europe as Russia threatens energy supply to Europe and other aggressions, the world is becoming more comfortable with Nuclear Enery as a clean and affordable power source, albeit years away.

That said, Bill Gates has been busy developing state-of-the-art and safe nuclear power. He is ready to build his first facility.

&amp;#x200B;

·  Bill Gates’ TerraPower has chosen Kemmerer, Wyoming, a frontier-era coal town, as the site where the company will build its first demonstration nuclear power plant.

·  The plant will cost about $4 billion, half coming from TerraPower and half coming from the United States government, the company said.

·  Will operate the plant, which will play a role in the power company's decarbonization strategy.

Rocky Mountain Power — a PacifiCorp division owned by Berkshire Hathaway Energy — Once built, the plant will provide a baseload of 345 megawatts, with the potential to expand its capacity to 500 megawatts.

Other Developments:

**PEGA Article Notes**

\- Trading Volumes Up Over 1 million shares

\- Japan &amp; USA doubling down on nuclear

\- Energy Prices up 400% in Europe

\- Ready to start drilling (major catalyst)

PEGA is undoubtedly a low cost way to gain exposure to both Uranium, the Athabasca Basin and in the same breath as major producers. Investors by their purchases are showing the Company to be involved and a potential major growth vehicle going forward in the volatile energy debate.

Watching the shares is recommended. For risk oriented investors interested in the sector, a purchase should be contemplated.

t3_xch5t5|1662999794|pennystocks|$RMTI Due Diligence. Could be a high-reward play!|"Before I get into the nitty-gritty, I want to say that I am not invested in this company and this is meant to provide a brief insight into this company, I highly encourage you to look deeper into this company!

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, lets go over what they **DO**!  
$RMTI, or Rockwell Medical, is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the treatment of iron deficiency and anemia. The WHO estimates that 42% of children less than 5 years of age and 40% of pregnant women worldwide are anemic, and I think we all know a few people AT LEAST that are anemic/have an iron deficiency. So, there is a LARGE demographic and potential user-base.   


""Rockwell Medical’s vision to establish a new standard of care in iron deficiency and anemia management is built on our novel and differentiated core technology platform, **Ferric Pyrophosphate Citrate (FPC)**. Our initial focus is the treatment of anemia in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Rockwell Medical has developed the exclusive drug therapy, **Triferic®** (ferric pyrophosphate citrate), **which is the only FDA-approved** therapeutic indicated for iron replacement and maintenance of hemoglobin in hemodialysis patients.""  


What stands out to me, is the ""....**which is the only FDA-approved**...."" part. That is quite big &amp; carries a lot of weight in this industry of medicine/technology. Along with the fact that they conduct business in 6 countries (the US, India, China, Peru, Chile, &amp; Canada), this company has tons of room for growth, increased revenue opportunities, networking, and more. If you would like to read up more on their tech, go [here](https://www.rockwellmed.com/our-technology/technology-platform/). That's a brief summary of what they do, from a product &amp; technology perspective. Now, onto the financials.  


With a market cap of only $17.6M, this company has tons of room to run and become a gem in your portfolio. Now, this is a smaller company so don't expect to see millions of dollars of cash on hand, in fact when companies are in this stage of growth I personally don't like to see lots of cash on hand. It shows they are reinvesting into the company.  


So, since December 31, 2021 and until June 30, 2022 RMTI has   
\- increased their total assets by 21.7%  
\- decreased their current liabilities by 11.5%  
\- and decreased their total liabilities by 15.4%  
This is **GOOD**. As I said, this shows that the company is decreasing some of its risks &amp; is building up its wealth in assets.

&amp;#x200B;

from a technical analysis point of view, I personally really like this price below 1.71 for a buy, with a target at 1.85 &amp; then a revisit of 2.10! With a float of under 10M, this thing really could pop!  


Okay, that's going to cover it for me. Thanks in advance for reading this short DD! just to reiterate, I do not have a position in this company or anything like that.

Indeed, many overpriced stocks out there. Many other calls for an imminent crash.

Yet the market is going up again today. At the same time Silver, one of the most hated assets in the world, is up .70+, and looks like will soon go back above $20. Gold up, oil and copper and related stocks up.  U and steel stocks up very strongly.   Dollar down.

Here is my take.  Friday made 4%, and am now down 4% for the year, was up think it was 25% in mid April. Each time I have got close to getting ahead for the first time since June, accts get slapped down.   

So very unscientific, but if my accts go positive, think the low is in for value stocks and resource stocks, and we can go up on such stocks 50% by end of January, and maybe silver can do the same.

But there is one IPO that IPOed recently that has not made a run...At all!  $ONFO has decreased 70% from IPO price and has not yet seen a remotely bounce.

We can compare $SHPH for instance that made their debut a week later than $ONFO. It has rocketed 377% since.

Lets compare float and MC

&amp;#x200B;

$SHPH  MC.         Shares out

515M.     13M

&amp;#x200B;

$ONFO MC.         Shares out

8M          5.5M

&amp;#x200B;

Then why invest in $ONFO

&amp;#x200B;

1. The daily VWAP is at 1.50 and the weekly VWAP 1.56. Share price is at 1.47. If it surpasses the daily and weekly VWAP it will move.
2. The warrants can be exercised at 4.50 so there is room on the upside.
3. Low float stock (makes it volatile both on the upside and downside)
4. Technical analysis shows a double bottom which is a strong bullish formation

t3_xax75t|1662836540|pennystocks|Why Halloween Is So Important to $PRTY Party City|"Why Halloween is such a big deal:

Our party store operates with an annual net profitability of about 16-17%.  So the math looks like this (used numbers that make it easy to see):

$100,000 Revenue

$30,000  COG (cost of goods)

$53,000  OE. (operating expense)

$17,000 Net Profit

For the month of October, however, our sales jump considerably, but our operating expenses stay mostly flat causing our net profitability to jump to 42%.

This basically means for every dollar in revenue we collect in October, $.42 drops directly to the bottom line vs $.17 for every other month.  

Now the picture of our Halloween store looks much different (think Halloween City).  For the month of October our net profitability is a whopping 62%!!  PRTY will have between 130-150 HC stores this year.  They only had 90 last year and those were not fully stocked.  My guess is these stores do between $400-$500K each per season (Sept/Oct).  If you use our party store net prof at 42% and use 140 stores that delivers $24.6M in Net profitability.  If you use the halloween store net at 62%, that number jumps to $36.3M.  And recall that includes the 50 extra stores this year vs last.  These net numbers should add directly to EBITDA so the better Halloween is, the more dramatically the elevated Net Prof numbers have on growing EBITDA.  Conversely, this is why PRTY gets PUNISHED if they have a bad Halloween.  

Also,  there will be about 756 PC stores this year vs 749 last year.  All of these store should see a similar increase to net profitability for Oct as our Party Store.  My guess is they will see much better net prof this year versus last given the improvement in their inventory position, offset partially by increased labor expense.  My two cents for what it's worth."|0.87|216|0|216
t3_xavcrz|1662831924|pennystocks|DD: Examining the bear case, or how $PRTY's Fitch Rating even shows meaningful upside for the core business.|"**TLDR -- in the absolute worst case scenario, a top 3 credit ratings agency assigns $PRTY a fundamental value of $534M - $805M. This represents upside of 85% - 178% from valuation as of Friday close, which was $289M market cap. At $534M market cap, share price would be $4.73.**

-----


**What are Fitch ratings / why should I care?** Fitch ratings is one of the ""big three"" credit ratings agencies (along with Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's). They are recognized by the SEC and the market broadly as an authority on the credit-worthiness of companies.

**What does Fitch have to say about $PRTY?** They last updated their outlook on [August 19th](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-affirms-party-city-at-b-outlook-revised-to-negative-from-stable-19-08-2022). The headlines are:

* B- rating (non-investment grade -- indicating that their financial situation is variable, hinging on vulnerable)

* Negative outlook (indicating that its ability to repay its debt may be deteriorating)

Both of those insights are fundamentally NOT good news, right? Not investment grade, saddled with tons of debt that it might not be able to pay.

**This is the fundamental bear case against $PRTY. There isn't a bear case around the idea that it doesn't have a good niche. People recognize its moat, its brand, its vertical integration -- they are worried about the debt.**

-----

Here's where it gets interesting though. Let's accept that bear case at face value. So what does it actually mean? And don't let me tell it to you -- let me just tell you what Fitch says.

**Does this mean that $PRTY is going to go bankrupt tomorrow?** Absolutely not. As Fitch says: 

*Limited Near-term Refinancing Risk: Following several recent transactions, including a DDE in 2020 and a refinancing in early 2021, the majority of Party City's capital structure matures in 2025/2026. The company has a small unsecured bond maturity of approximately $23 in August 2023 that Fitch expects the company will repay from existing sources of liquidity. This maturity runway provides Party City several years to execute on initiatives to grow sales and improve margins before addressing its capital structure again.*

So basically, despite the negative outlook, Fitch cites that $PRTY has 2022, 2023, and 2024 to execute on its strategy in order to improve cash flows and be in a position to handle its debt obligations, which begin in 2025.

**Is $PRTY vulnerable given a pending recession?** No -- in fact it's the opposite! As Fitch says:

*During a challenging macroeconomic period, the company could benefit from trade-down activity, with consumers opting to celebrate more events at home, but also experience headwinds from consumers trading down to even lower priced competitors like discounters. In a low single-digit comps decline scenario, Fitch expects Party City would be able to manage expenditures and maintain an adequate liquidity profile.*

**Okay okay, whatever. But what is the absolute worst case scenario for $PRTY?** 

Well, there's two ways Fitch looks at this. 

One is to look at $PRTY's **liquidation value** -- meaning how much it would be worth if it got taken to the junkyard and sold for scraps. 

The second way is to look at $PRTY's **going concern value** -- so if the company went through bankruptcy, restructured, and then was allowed to continue operating afterwards.

Note -- debtholders would have priority in this situation, and equity holders would likely get screwed. But the point here is to look at the *fundamental value of the company in the worst case scenario*

In each of these settings, Fitch evaluates the two key businesses: Party City -- the retail operation, and Anagram -- the wholesale business.

**Going concern value -- the second to worst case scenario** -- Fitch assigns a going concern value of **$625M** to the Party City retail business, and ** $180M** to Anagram. So the total going concern value would be **$805M**.

**Liquidation value -- the absolute worst case scenario** -- Fitch assigns a liquidation value of **$489M** to the Party City retail business, and ** $45M** to Anagram. So the total liquidation value would be **$534M**.

-----

Wait -- did you catch that?!?! **IN THE ABSOLUTE WORST CASE SCENARIO, THIS BUSINESS IS WORTH $534M. IT CURRENTLY HAS A MARKET CAP OF $289M!!!! AND THE ENTIRE REASON IT HAS BEEN BEATEN DOWN IS ITS DEBT LEVELS, WHICH IT HAS MANAGED SUCCESSFULLY HISTORICALLY AND DO NOT POSE ANY RISK TO OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.**

Needless to say, I view this as extremely bullish. Fitch is an objective source that has no interest in pumping $PRTY -- they're just calling the shots like they see them. 

I also don't want to confuse readers -- if $PRTY went bankrupt equity holders would definitely be screwed!

But what is totally clear to me is that the risks to this business are significantly overstated, resulting in a beaten down share price. There is room to run for this business, and there is plenty of upside to be had. Investing at these levels, in my opinion, represent tremendous potential upside.

$PRTY on dudes.

An introduction to BioLargo, innovator of cleantech technologies.  
Great to see that more and more attention is coming our way.  
Some have been early in investing in BioLargo but now is the perfect time to discover this  
\- the deeper you will dig the more you will like what you will find. 

  
That is why many here who did that (and have the necessary funds) own massive positions now.  
Progress is happening on all fronts and it will become more visible in each of the next filings, reports and PRs.

  
This won’t stay exceptionally undervalued forever.  
Do your Own DD.

Below I try to help you with it.

 **$BLGO is already up 41% in the past month (while NASDAQ is down 6%)** and more and more folks are realizing what an amazing investment opportunity this is.

[Quick Overview \(thanks catatsea\)](https://preview.redd.it/x6406gsi2tm91.png?width=1560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec370609d9d68845dc554b927fa3fb9f86a5155c)

**Clean Air, Clean Water, and a Cleaner Earth**\- all while breaking all revenue and growth records- and having the best-known PFAS solution out there.   
And POOPH (their tech) becoming a blockbuster product and getting into Walmart soon. 

It just became a bit more visible what an amazing success story BioLargo is and will be. 

Everyone who understands what is happening here will wants their in or add more shares. 

Last week I made a post trying to explain what is happening - It had already had 53k views:

[**BioLargo DD 2022 $BLGO - is Clean Water!! Clean Air, Cleaner Earth, and Much More.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/x379yz/biolargo_dd_2022_blgo_is_clean_water_clean_air/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

All our Biolargo community Platforms are growing fast. We just passed the 1000 Viewer mark on Stocktwits and the other Reddit and discord communities have more and more folks joining to discuss and do their DD as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

The recent EPA action paired with the big engineering contracts and Pooph breaking all sales records make for a very attractive investment. 

We know some who discovered BLGO that just bought in and many longs that are currently adding. 

I  want to use the opportunity to share some more information as IMHO  BioLargo is one of the best investing opportunities out there - the perfect combination - of investing in the “clean” future while going for the big bucks.

[**GREAT BIOLARGO INTRODUCTION VIDEO**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke_L-Tm_kPE) **3 min**

This is a must watch great 3 min Corporate video that gives you the perfect idea about what BioLargo is, who the Heads are, and what their mission is - ""WE MAKE LIFE BETTER""!

&amp;#x200B;

The progress is accelerating: the partnerships/ two subsidiaries turned profitable/the California engineering office opened/

record  growth/ record revenues/ amazing study results/ team-ups/first AEC  Client and first AEC Channel Partner on board/ biggest contracts yet/  Moving to phase II of contracts with multiples in revenues soon/ AOS  commercial units built/ promising acquisition happened/

AEC  improved/ new patents filed/ trials at municipalities scheduled/ almost  debt free / Asia joint venture showing First adaptions/ new studies  released/ more studies coming/ prototype production systems for Nuclear  fuel innovator/

cash flow positive  on the horizon / giant waste to energy project started/ $500 Million plus project/ working on Lithium extraction/ 10 Billion Dollars for PFAS  solutions from administration announced etc. etc..

This clean tech / W2E/ wound care/minerals/water play seems to be the perfect place to be invested in.

Some might have bought in early But At around a $60 Million Market cap this makes for an incredible investing opportunity.

A  like-minded investor strongly believes In a bright future for $BLGO as well. I like his post “WHY BLGO MAY NOT REMAIN UNDERVALUED AND  UNDISCOVERED MUCH LONGER” and also Pennyqueen’s **3 Products Behind The Rise of This Clean-Water Tech Co.**

She made Biolargo one of her top picks:

&gt;**“Every  once in a great while, I find a company that is grossly undervalued,  aligned with my principles, and has commercial-ready technology.  BioLargo has passed my test with flying colors, and I truly believe we  are witnessing the birth of a giant”**

It is also good to know that investors close to the company just invested about a million dollars directly into the company.

BTW-  don’t forget that the BLGO CFO decided to solely get paid in options that have an exercise price at .24 - above today’s levels.

That means you can currently buy shares at the prices that the CFO will have to pay for his shares - as his SOLE payment.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's Get to it:

https://preview.redd.it/o99mst039tm91.jpg?width=1378&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fa021aa2961c0e4798d9ef9b93c78fc201e5473

**The Clean Water Bill passed that guarantees $168 Billion for clean water and PFAS contamination is becoming a hot environmental topic.**

[**MOST IMPORTANTLY THE EPA IS DESIGNATING TWO PFAS AS HAZMAT WASTE.**](https://www.epa.gov/pfas/epa-actions-address-pfas)

More and more attention is coming to The PFAS problem and the necessary cleanup:  


Designating  PFOA and PFOS under CERCLA would improve transparency, and accountability,  and deliver on Administrator Regan’s PFAS Strategic Roadmap

BLGO tweet:  

&gt;„The EPA's decision to designate the two most common #PFAS chemicals as  hazardous chemicals under CERCLA means that the companies who produced  the PFAS will have to pay for clean-up, which ""could run to billions of  dollars"".“

The PFAS cleanup is estimated to cost $80/Billion a year - This is very important to know- 

as you have to keep in mind that as of today  BioLargo has the most effective and most efficient targeted PFAS  collecting technology known - the AEC. 

If you have not heard about PFAS - you certainly will - and when you do please think back to the moment that you read this post - and the small company that has the best solution out there.  

You are welcome ;)

&amp;#x200B;

**AEC - The Aqueus Electrostatic Concentrator**

Introduction Video:

[**The BioLargo AEC - the effective, sustainable solution for removing PFAS from water**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unx9coSjIuQ)

This is a great Introduction Video for the best PFAS remediation tech - A must watch!

BioLargo  Aqueous Electrostatic Concentrator (AEC) is designed to provide rapid,  effective, and affordable concentration of per- and polyfluoroalkyl  substances (PFAS) in water. It works by separating PFAS compounds in an electrostatic field and forcing them through a proprietary membrane system.

The result – the AEC removes &gt;99% PFAS from water in a continuous flow, at energy costs as low as 30 cents per 1,000 gallons.

Advantages over other technologies:

▪ More energy-efficient

▪ More affordable on per-gallon basis

▪ Much less PFAS-laden waste produced

▪ Less activated carbon required in PFAS life cycle

▪ Higher purity of final water

▪ Compact; small footprint

Development and commercialization of the AEC is supported in part by a grant provided by the US EPA SBIR.

https://preview.redd.it/9zgarat55tm91.png?width=1416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69725331b349936072c80928ef619f863d16c57c

While many new PFAS destruction approaches recently made headlines. They all would require some sort of concentration /filtering to make more sense.  They actually could become really powerful when used in combination with the AEC.

That is the beauty of PFAS-laden the concept - take the PFAS out in the cheapest best way possible and then destruct them in the best way that will be available at each point in time.

Carbon filtration causes 1000 times more PFAS laden waste than the AEC. That the EPA now has classified as Hazardous substances.

A HUGE step forward to bringing the AEC to the center of attention.

A must read of detailed description of the BioLargo tech: 

**BioLargo’s Breakthrough PFAS Removal Technology Offers Hope For Clean Water Across The U.S.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9zojicotgtm91.png?width=3036&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5e3aeef892118d4198800ff8a004170329957d1

**BioLargo already signed the first contract for a BIG PFAS remediation project.**

**The first big AEC channel partner is also on board that is preparing the national launch of the AEC technology in a certain sector, and regulatory is playing into our hands as well.** 

All  while we will face record growth and record revenues for many Qs to come through other  engineering projects and Pooph that is getting more and more sales and attention.

So if you would hear about a company that has solutions for two of the massive global water problems and for now they have the most effective and efficient solution for that $80 Billion/year PFAS cleanup and the entire company is worth just around $50 Million- what would you think?

Right, It would sound too good to be true.

But folks it is not. We have been following BioLargo closely and what they set out to do is actually happening (with some delays). 

But that is not the only Catalyst - there are actually 7 but there is no time to discuss all of them here.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**POOPH:**

You certainly will have already seen or are going to see the TV commercial for BioLargo's white label Pet Odor  Elimination Product POOPH - that works magic and is just starting to take over the Amazon Best Seller lists and is becoming a Blockbuster  Product.

https://preview.redd.it/423c784d9tm91.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e2e4b1f868e0b2d2af7e660bbcc07a303b87d7b

When you are going to see the commercial please remember reading this post when BioLargo was in the low/ mid  .20s

Pooph  is the Pet Odor eliminator that is based on BioLargo’s Cupridyne Clean  Tech and brought to market by the marketing geniuses of Ikigai.

[Imprssive list of Blockbuster successes by the Ikigai founder - POOPH is the next one ](https://preview.redd.it/fi1za1h27tm91.png?width=2384&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3ca57bb2e2357085b90ea2b4d31daec9ae86de4)

&amp;#x200B;

POOPH is breaking all records.

The commercial aired 2400 times in the past 30 days- and every American will learn about this amazing brand.

Get yourself a spray - It is the cheapest way to do hands on DD - It works magic. 

When I tested Cupridyne clean a few years ago I knew that if the rest of the BioLargo Tech just almost works as amazing as their Odor elimination/clean air product - I will be Golden. 

https://preview.redd.it/mv35ou786tm91.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e603be41140a8db7858ddbcc325c2115f03dd8a

&amp;#x200B;

Sales almost doubled from May to June and almost doubled again from June to  July and they are still growing fast. Note that In July alone the sales were almost as high as in the three previous months combined AND Q2 broke already all  records - So it is a given that Q3 will beat those numbers by far!!n 

[**GREAT POOPH ""INSIDER"" VIDEO**](https://vimeo.com/702836603/a9cf65b430) **2min**

This is an insider Video that gives you fantastic insights into the POOPH product and helps you understand what a Massive opportunity this is. 

The current run rate is already $26 million - that means if they will continue selling at today’s pay it would result in that amount of annual revenue-  and that is before it has hit big box retailers like Walmart  (scheduled for Q4).

[Yes we have BioLargo's Cupridyne Clean indirectly featured on national TV - at no cost ](https://preview.redd.it/iauyvefc6tm91.png?width=2166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be9714e8e91b331b2372ae1c7cab3f612bc9192d)

The  whole purpose of the POOPH brand is to grow it fast (to around $100 million in revenue) and to sell it to a giant like P&amp;G They expect to be able to sell the brand at 3-7 times revenue. 

At the target revenue of  $100 million /year that 3-7 X is expected to bring in a $300-700 Million brand sale price. BioLargo will get 20% of that exit. 

Hence we are talking about a fascinating $ 60-140 million cash infusion that will occur in the next few years. 

BioLargo is already breaking all revenue records and that is to be expected to continue. Until the brand sale, we will get a 6% licensing fee and a manufacturer's margin.

**Note:**

POOPH  is on the market for 8 months and is breaking all records and outperforming all projections. Their current run rate already is at $26  Million- So very likely they will hit their targeted 100 million earlier than in their 4-year goal. Pooph will bring a lot more clients,  attention, cash, and new investors to BioLargo, and most importantly it proves the business model of CHANNEL PARTNERS. 

It is proven now that when you pair BioLargo Tech with the best Marketing folks or best big Engineering companies - 

there will be massive successes!!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nlcbery69tm91.png?width=3048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6de3ed3339a41d816b7eaeeec1baec3764157f40

&amp;#x200B;

It is just a question of time (and Good News) until a big wave of new investors and money will come to join this Clean Water, Clean Air,  Cleaner Earth (and wound care) investing opportunity.

The  share price is very low as BioLargo paid off almost $7.6 Million in  debt in the last years and some of the projects were delayed - but it is  all happening now = we are already deep into the BLGO paradigm shift  but the market has not yet reacted.

BioLargo  just published a  New Quarterly Revenue Record - Quarterly Revenues in  Q2 Grew 185% Compared to Q2 of 2021 and it is expected to be followed by higher numbers and growth in the following Qs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial highlights**

https://preview.redd.it/6jne0oiv9tm91.png?width=686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63160a65bd73a5754aa125103b288922e016cf12

\*  Company-wide consolidated revenue for the three and six months ended  June 30, 2022, was $1,323,000 and $2,287,000, which is a 185% and 121%  increase over the same periods in 2021; revenue this quarter was a 37%  increase compared with the first quarter of 2022.

\*  Revenues from ONM Environmental, the company’s odor and VOC control  subsidiary, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, were  $700,000 and $1,300,000, an increase of $344,000 and $658,000, from the  same periods in 2021.

In the second quarter of 2022, this subsidiary generated a net  operating income of $56,000, compared to a net operating loss of  $190,000 in the same period of 2021.

[Impressive Debt reduction - When you see the spikes in the Stockprice charts - those were used for the debt reduction - it is done now. ](https://preview.redd.it/uphktmr1atm91.png?width=3098&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a10d8e9f011ed7c673fb92f649db496e2048015)

**Commercial and developmental highlights**

\*  First PFAS customer – the company recently secured its first PFAS  customer. As part of this project, BioLargo will engineer a  comprehensive PFAS mitigation plan for an industrial site, and has  signed an agreement with a new channel partner to sell the company’s  PFAS treatment equipment and engineering services.

\*  Ikigai’s POOPH – The company’s white-label pet odor control product  partnership with Ikigai is advancing well and generating increasing  revenues both from manufacturing the product and from license royalties.  Sales thus far have exceeded early expectations, and the company’s  partners at Ikigai are confident that growth will continue, especially  as they push to get the product onto shelves at major retailers.

\*  Garratt-Callahan partnership – The company expects first sales of the  “minimal liquid discharge” (MLD) wastewater treatment equipment  developed in partnership with Garratt-Callahan to begin soon, following  discussions with an expanding list of Garratt-Callahan customers.

https://preview.redd.it/fsqpkv8z9tm91.png?width=3026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eafea2e73d07558c6179d87077b464ba56a9226e

&amp;#x200B;

\*  Larger engineering projects – In this quarter, BioLargo Engineering,  Science &amp; Technologies executed engineering projects for new customers, including its project to develop prototypes with Ultra Safe  Nuclear, and the waste-to-energy plant project in South America. With both of these projects, early phase work is nearly done, and management anticipates that additional phases will soon begin, with the scope of work and level of engagement expanding.

[It is actually mindboggling how many catalysts are happening at Biolargho - Normally multi nationals deal with projects these sizes.](https://preview.redd.it/57ddh86hbtm91.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7417ab7585c07053ad02c1cebb5cf2f54ff0bb0a)

&amp;#x200B;

So if you would hear about a company that has solutions for two of the massive global water problems and for now they have the most effective and efficient solution for that $80 Billion/year PFAS cleanup and the entire company is worth just around $60 Million- what would you think?

Right, It would sound too good to be true.

But folks it is not. We have been following BioLargo closely and what they set out to do is actually happening (with some delays).

&amp;#x200B;

It is the perfect time to discover this as they will keep breaking revenue records and they are destined to become a Global Clean Tech Powerhouse and those trade normally at least 20 times higher than $60 million.

I would not know a single reason why this should not be valued at a  couple hundred million when all that we know becomes more visible to the general investor.  
I believe we are at a tipping point where not much is needed for the next (bigger) leg up.   
My guess is prelim Q3 results paired with some other update - will do the job 

We highly recommend taking a deep look at the tech and the company!!

**About the OP:**

I  am a purpose-driven investor that has made amazing returns on my Exact  Sciences investment -my core position was up between 1600% and 2650 %.  When I placed it into BioLargo - where I expect even higher returns.

For many years I was sharing all the info I could find about EXAS and paired it with my thoughts on the Yahoo message board.

I promised myself that whenever I’ll feel 100% confident again that I found a ""guaranteed"" multi-bagger - I will bet the farm.

I am very happy that I was able to accumulate almost 1% ownership of Biolargo over the past few years.

I  attended the last 5 BLGO shareholder meetings, do almost daily DD, had conversations with all the key management people, and did a few 1000  posts on various message boards. I am constantly reassessing my Biolargo investing strategy- so my DD is mainly for myself but might give interesting information to others as well.

I  am not a financial advisor, this post is made for educational purposes only. Literally. Don’t take my word for anything that is presented in  this post, do your own research, and invest solely based on the thesis  that you create for yourself. Don’t get influenced by anyone.

I  honestly believe there is no better way to place the money than putting it into a purposeful company that will have a positive impact on the world, will „Make Life Better“, and also looks like a certain multi-bagger.

Please dive into $BLGO,  join the various fast-growing platforms like  Stocktwits, The BioLargo Subreddit, and the BioLargo Discord and let me know if you have any questions!

I am sure you will love what you will find.

Happy to answer any questions! 

Good Luck To You!

t3_x9g2hq|1662681854|pennystocks|The Cell Ag Trade is Coming (Lab Grown Meat) --&gt; $CULTF|"I've been a strong believer in cellular agriculture (cell ag) for a couple years. The more I research it and the more developments I see, the more I like it.

***TLDR*** \- *cellular agriculture is growing meat in a lab. In its simplest form it means companies can make steaks without ever killing (or needing to farm) a single cow.*

It's great for the animals and the environment. But this is PennyStocks and we are here to be early on trends, so lets talk about that - its also probably the best trade opp we have left in this decade in terms of revolutionary new technology and products. Feels like another cannabis x psychedelics x crypto.

If you're in this reddit you probably know that capital inflow into a sector is what its all about. Floating boats and all that.

Well, in the history of cellular agriculture there has only been $2 billion or so put in to the space. And \~75% of that has been in the past year, during a bear market. Hit google and you'll see a bunch of recent privco uprounds between $2M and $400M (Upside Foods in April 2022 - Bill Gates was in this).

\----------------------------

**So, what's the trade?**

\----------------------------

Right now there aren't many options, unless you're a silicon valley VC or your daddy left you a trust fund. There are only 3 publicly-traded companies in the space, and everything else is still private, taking cheques from Richard Branson and Ashton Kutcher.

Thats the problem - and it's the opportunity.

\------------------------------

The 3 public companies are:

**Agronomics - $ANIC** \- $150M+ valuation, trades on the LSE so the structure is less familiar to me. Reply with comments if you know more about it. From what I see, its like a massive mutual fund for cell ag companies that writes big cheques and holds.

**SteakHolder Foods - $STKH** \- 3D meat printing operating company from Israel. Trades on the Nasdaq. \~$40M valuation. Could be a good bet but I don't like how they don't have much news and its not exactly clear what their plans are.

**CULT Food Science - $CULT** / **$CULTF** \- as you gathered from the title, this is what I'm looking at. It looks like a classic CSE pump gone exactly to plan. Extreme liquidity for insiders, trading over 160 million shares since it went public in January 2022. I was an early investor that was buying in the Spring at a lot higher than its current price of $0.05. I've been watching it closely and I think these deal guys actually fucked up and built a real company by mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uakw3knp4qm91.png?width=1436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=580d2dab5de46b353092f6fdcf6b078d2bdfe139

I had nearly written it off, but yesterday I got sent a blog post from their CEO and it made me reconsider. Here's the link:

[Why We Believe Cellular Agriculture is a Generational Opportunity](https://medium.com/@cultfoodscience/why-we-believe-cellular-agriculture-is-a-generational-opportunity-e092c3a5ef9b)

There's the expected amount of corporate fluff in here but what made me look twice was that:

1. Their CEO actually knows what he is talking about and has experience in the space. He actually had a cell ag startup that he got in to Y Combinator.
2. The portfolio they've assembled is better than anything I've seen from a CSE deal. Thats not a high bar, but still.

Their financials show they that put around $4,000,000 in to their investments, and the company is now trading at around $7,000,000, even though they made a lot of those investment announcements over 6 months ago and a lot of the privcos are announcing uprounds.

I'm not sure what percent they own of each company (anyone able to fact check and comment is appreciated), but this smells like an arb opportunity and something that institutions would start to look at as a value play if the space really heated up.

\----------------------------

If you're just looking at the chart then I fully agree it looks like a piece of CSE/OTC garbage.

The whole float (157m shares) has now been turned though, and it doesn't seem like it would take much buying to bring this back to $0.25+ (CULT's last PP price before going public) and beyond to ATH.

Not advice at all ofc, but I like the risk/reward here and think I'm going to continue to add.

Lmk what you think / talk me out of it / call me a pumper / all good

 Carlsbad, New Mexico (PR Newswire) September 8, 2022 – NextMart, Inc. (the “Company” or “NXMR” - Pink Sheets Alternative Reporting Pink: NXMR) – NXMR would like to announce it will be opening new water stations for oil field services in the States of Oklahoma, Montana, and Texas during the 1st quarter of the fiscal year starting October 1, 2022.  


The Company expects that these new water stations will become operational on a staggered basis, with Oklahoma and Texas being the first to be completed. But the Company fully expects that all three will be in full operation by January 1, 2023. The Company expects these new water stations to produce top line revenue of between $10M and $15M USD during the fiscal year October 1, 2022, to September 30, 2023.  


Mr. Maldonado (CEO of the Company), states…""We are excited to enter the oil field service industry in Oklahoma, Texas, and Montana with the opening of these water stations. Water in large quantities is needed wherever there is oil and gas production. This is a great way to enter a new oil and gas market and be profitable day one, but also create a toehold in that same market for other future operations. Once we have a footprint in these three states with these water stations, we will be announcing the start of revenue generating activity on other related oil field service programs in these same states that are highly profitable and have been in development for the past few months. In short, we can use these water stations to bring in revenues, but also to be a base of operation for the future growth of the Company. It is without question a great situation for the Company as it expands its operations into three new market.” "|0.5|0|0|0

Oil and gas producer customers were more concerned with securing equipment and operational performance than a sudden drop in oil prices or potential recession, Schlumberger Chief Executive Olivier Le Peuch said at a conference on Wednesday.

Le Peuch said international oil activity also has the potential to grow at a faster rate than North American activity going forward.

Shares of Schlumberger were down about 1.6% midday to $36.73 each, as oil futures sank about 4%. Schlumberger’s stock is up about 23% year-to-date.

Oil and gas prices have jumped sharply this year as Western sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have disrupted energy supplies and flows. Brent crude was trading around $90 a barrel on Wednesday morning, well off levels seen in recent months, but about 25% higher than a year ago.

“There is huge momentum,” Le Peuch said at the Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference in New York, adding that current investment rates and consistency are “something I’ve not seen for quite some time.”

As oil prices have climbed and activity has picked up, Schlumberger said it is seeing its best margins in almost a decade.

Carson City, Nevada - ([NewMediaWire](https://www.newmediawire.com/)) - September 08, 2022 - Pharmagreen Biotech, Inc.,(OTCQB: PHBI), (“Pharmagreen” or the “Company” is pleased to announce that it has developed its first formulated nutraceutical product and is in the process of organizing the retail sales distribution channels for its new product. The Pharmagreen team is very excited to be launching this nutraceutical product utilizing a combination of fifteen ingredients from medicinal plants and mushrooms.

Pharmagreen’s proprietary blend is unique to the market, a nutrigenomic supplement for the utmost mind and body experience. Nutrigenomics, or nutritional genomics, concerns the relationship between nutrients, diet, and genetic expression. The Company’s new product was formulated to repair damage done to your DNA. This damage happens during cell division and as a result of oxidative stresses due to environmental influences such as pollution. The human body has the ability to repair DNA with special proteins but over time these proteins get used up. By using fungi and plants that contain β-glucans, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, lipopolysaccharides, and many more beneficial compounds it is possible to reverse damage done to your genes.

Pharmagreen created this new line of genomic supplements because health and wellness start on the cellular level. This product, and new products as they become available, can be purchased through the Company's soon to be launched online store, Shopify, Amazon and other third-party online outlets. The company has also updated its corporate website [www.pharmagreen.ca](http://www.pharmagreen.ca/) with latest business development.

The nutraceutical market was worth around USD $449.5 Billion in 2021 and is estimated to grow to about USD $745.5 billion by 2028. As per the analysis shared by Zion market research report, the Nutraceutical Market is expected to grow annually at a CAGR of around 8% (2022-2028).

Utilizing the Company's expertise in plant genetics and proprietary tissue culture technologies, Pharmagreen's transgenic program uses the newest technology available to research and create nutraceuticals, protein-based formulations, and daily supplements with the potential to improve lives and address a wide variety of disease conditions.

As stated in the previous news release, Pharmagreen is continuing business development with Long Valley Farms while it completes its fundraising for the acquisition. The micro business license application, which will enable significant and immediate revenue generation for the cannabis business, is being processed by Mendocino County, California and various relevant governing bodies.

Mr. Ethan Styles of Long Valley Farms stated, “My molecular cell biology studies have really opened my eyes to the nutritional and genomic benefits of compounds found in fungi and medicinal plants. In formulating our new products, I take the same all natural and holistic approach we use for our cannabis production. Nutrigenomics is an emerging and fascinating science on the cutting edge of our knowledge of human health, and I am really excited to bring these unique combinations to market.”

“We are truly excited to be starting our sample testing with friends and family with our proprietary blend of some of the most therapeutic and efficacious plants and fungi nutraceutical products. With this formulation, we are aiming to help increase energy levels to support optimal brain function. We look forward to starting our online sales soon.” stated Peter Wojcik, CEO of Pharmagreen.

Hyla Maintains International Distribution in 10 Countries, Including at Internationally Renowned UK Department Store, Harrods

CAVE CREEK, Ariz., Sept. 08, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire – Endexx Corporation (OTC:EDXC), a provider of innovative, plant-based, and sustainable health and skincare products, today announces the acquisition of a controlling interest in Hyla US Holdco Limited, a producer and distributor of organic, plant-based, all-natural, zero-nicotine vape products.

The acquisition provides two key benefits to Endexx in the near term:

an expanded international distribution network in 10 countries - Dubai, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, France, the Kingdom of Bahrain, Egypt, and Switzerland, which Endexx expects will provide further leverage for sales of its men's skin care line, Blesswell, as well as its CBD products designed for pain under its CBD Unlimited brand; and

a significant increase in Endexx's consolidated revenues, based on Hyla's distribution and sales to date of its non-nicotine, vegan vape products.

""This acquisition is an important opportunity for Endexx, as the ability to expand the distribution for our CBD and non-CBD Blesswell men's skin care products is a significant benefit. We have already achieved substantial success in the U.S. through our retail distribution in Walgreens, Target, and CVS and, as announced yesterday, Amazon. International distribution in Europe and the Middle East, with the potential of future distribution in Latin America and Asia, holds great promise,"" commented Endexx CEO Todd Davis.

Hyla currently markets its proprietary non-nicotine, guarana and L-dopa-based vape products in a wide variety of flavors. The Hyla device is the first non-nicotine vape product to be produced in this manner in the United States and provides an unprecedented 4,500 puffs per device. Introduced in October 2021, Hyla's initial inventory of 140,000 devices was sold out within the first month of availability. The Hyla vape products bear the Underwriters Laboratories global safety certification and is CE approved."|0.6|2|0|2

Independent biostatisticians reviewed unblinded data from the 140 subjects who completed PALISADE-2 before the Company paused enrollment in the study in July 2022, following announcement of topline results from PALISADE-1, its first Phase 3 clinical trial of PH94B in SAD. The Company does not itself have access to unblinded data from PALISADE-2.

t3_x8xduj|1662634661|pennystocks|Update on Elsight (ELS:ASX)|"I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/uxct6x/elsight_a_stock_ive_discovered_which_id_like_to/) 4 months ago, I don't have anything else to do so I figured I'd chime in with an update:

Since my last post, Elsight have signed three deals, one with Brazilian drone company [speedbird.aero](https://speedbird.aero) and two with [Spright](https://www.gospright.com/), a subsidiary of Air Methods ([link 1](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02539664-3A596843?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4), [link 2](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02536875-3A596397?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4), [link 3](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02554001-3A599228?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4)). These deals have added up to $250,000 USD in sales in the past few months, with potential for another $500,000 at least just from Speedbird in the next year.

Another positive sign is something the FAA is working on called Remote ID. Next week (September 16) all drone manufacturers will be required to comply with the FAA regulations on Remote ID. On their website Elsight shows how their chip supports FAA-compliant Remote ID from within the chip itself without requiring additional hardware. This to me shows that Elsight is ahead of the curve on compliance with the FAA, and if EASA (European FAA) follows suit, Elsight will be well positioned in both major markets.

I bought 250 shares at $.42, and the stock has been pretty stagnant since. Their social media shows they're at a big conference in Las Vegas now, so I hope something interesting comes out of the show (apparently they're sharing a booth with Spright, which is interesting to me given the two deals already with Spright, signs of something bigger to come?). I also am still waiting on news from DroneUp, now that Walmart have said they're going to be increasing their drone delivery capabilities to six states, but that seems to be still in the pipeline. I know it'll come eventually though, because DroneUp uses the Elsight chip in each and every one of their drones, so they have to order more."|0.68|9|0|9

I'm trying to work out the search terms/indicator names that'll allow me to see a list of pairs that fluctuate regularly. 

I see there are things like Rate of Change, Momentum Oscillation, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, Coefficient of Variation but can't work out if there is a name/indicator for 'price goes up and down frequently.' I'm not too bothered about how much it 'goes up and down,' more that it does that frequently.

I thought the most obvious would be volatility but as far as I was aware, that includes the 'magnitude' of price movements, i.e. the deviation of percentage price change, as opposed to just how 'often' it goes up and down. (Unless anyone can think of a way to utilize volatility for my objectives?)

Does anyone know if something like this exists or has any research tips to further me?

Apple will rely on the Globalstar service to enable iPhones to send emergency messages.|"Mobile satellite-communications company Globalstar
 saw its shares jump as much as 42% after being halted for news on Wednesday. The company disclosed during Apple
’s annual fall hardware launch event that it would be operating an satellite-powered emergency SOS service for the forthcoming iPhone 14

The stock quickly gave up most of those gains and is currently trading up about 5% for the day, after being down more than 10% prior to the announcement. Nonetheless, the stock move shows how exposure to a large technology company such as Apple can have a significant impact on a smaller entity’s operations.

In early 2020, Globalstar said it had agreed to to provide services for a “potential customer” that it did not name. On Wednesday Globalstar revealed in a regulatory filing that customer is Apple.

A copy of the agreement shows that Apple can elect to receive warrants to buy up to 2.64% of Globalstar’s outstanding stock at $1.01 per share. But Apple isn’t obligated to receive the warrants.

Globalstar now sees 2023 revenue between $185 million and $230 million, depending partly on the degree to which it achieves goals tied to its Apple deal. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had previously expected $130.6 million in 2023 revenue from the company."|0.79|41|0|41

&amp;#x200B;

Banxa has made significant further progress on its entry into the key US market, including:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\- US local acquiring (domestic card processing) has been activated (this means lower costs from Forex fees and payments to intermediaries + increased conversion rates and customers)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Comprehensive payments coverage is now available to Banxa's partners and customers operating in the US market (this includes credit care &amp; wire transfers; resulting in higher conversion rates)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Lodged a further 28 Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs), bringing the total to 40 (MTLs, as I have said before, cuts out middlemen and and increases the regulatory presence in the market)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Appointment of US Chief Compliance Officer, US Chief Operating Officer, and US Chief Technology Officer out of Reno Nevada (with US Chief Financial Officer to be appointed soon)

&amp;#x200B;

As the company executive have stated before and are currently stating, Banxa has a long term and integrating view that focuses on *""mastering and simplifying the complexity of payments, conversions, compliance, and regulations for crypto and Web3""* as the CEO put it.  A greater foothold in the USA is key in the goal as the sheer size of the market makes it a must entry.

Original research below and photo of the new Denver facility. DYOR|"**This is a highly speculative stock.**   **All below is my original research. Photo attached.**

**NEW CATALYST: KALERA INVESTOR DAY ANNOUNCED FOR 22 SEPTEMBER**

[https://www.einnews.com/pr\_news/589821349/kalera-to-host-virtual-analyst-and-investor-event-on-september-22](https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/589821349/kalera-to-host-virtual-analyst-and-investor-event-on-september-22)

KAL US is the largest vertical farmer in the US. It has c.$144mn of assets on balance sheet (LED lights, racks etc), low debt, and owns a highly regarded indoor seed business Vindara. New CEO hired, plans a CMD in September to highlight new strategy could be a catalyst for recovery. Up to 50% of the stock is tied up post de-SPAC with lock-up and insiders.

KAL US is down nearly 85% since IPO a few months ago and closer to 95% down from its 2021 peak when it was traded in Oslo! Typical de-SPAC in a bad market this summer has seen the stock collapse on low volume. KAL is the leading and only pure play US vertical farming company on Nasdaq and will soon complete its US roll out with a focus on delivering free cash positive farms in 2023 (according to CEO at Q2 results). It hired a very experienced CEO in May this year and recently signed a big deal with foodservice giant US Foods which is expected to ramp up sales in 2023 and 2024 and a positive validation of the product. Valuation is now only $40mn compared to APPH and LOCL $300mn+, and KAL debt is low ($30mn including the convertible), far below net assets of c.$250mn.

I have finished weeks of research into KAL going back through the filings and results presentations. Several reasons why I think it’s a **speculative buy** now are:

**1. BEST CEO IN THE SECTOR HIRED RECENTLY** – Jim Leighton. Hired in May 2022, previously CEO of Inghams (largest poultry farmer in Australia, $2bn in sales), Perdue Foods etc…so he understands food manufacturing of living products and how to run a major business.

**2. VERY LOW VALUATION VS ASSETS AND PEERS.** At end Q2 KAL had $144mn of fixed assets on balance sheet, in addition it also owns 100% of seed tech business Vindara (acquired in 2021 for $25mn) and according to latest filings has low debt – only $20mn of long-term low-cost Farm Coop debt and a “friendly” shareholder $10mn convertible bond. Equity Cap is only $40mn. If it was valued at same market cap as LOCL or APPH (both losing more EBITDA 2022 – LOCL pre-Pete’s) then the equity would 10x from here! So today I’m paying $40mn equity for $144mn of net fixed assets (lights, racks etc) and 100% of Vindara, with a low amount of debt vs. peers and no short-term debt refi.

**3. CASH FLOW AND EBITDA ON THE TURN BY YEAR END.** Why? Capex on the announced US facilities is close to ending. Denver has just opened ahead of schedule (news yesterday, photo attached), St Paul Minnesota is expected to open in Q4. Production has stabilised (Q2 results presentation said 85% stable yield) and sales are starting to ramp up with new retail customers and the start of the US Foods contract – see below. KALERA sales in Q2 were 90% whole-head lettuce. Why is this important? Because whole-head is a small part of the lettuce market, and KAL is now starting to ramp up production of “loose/cut leaf” product – I expect this can accelerate sales in 2023.

**4. US FOODS – BIG CONTRACT UP TO 50% OF ALL KAL US PRODUCTION** \-– this was signed in Q2 pre-IPO **(i.e. never announced on Nasdaq!)** and according to the conference call when it was announced, US Foods will aim to buy up to 50% (FIFTY PER CENT!) of all US production, led by St Paul Minnesota expected to open in Q4 2022. Most US Farms are breakeven at about 50%, so expect 2023 numbers to start to reflect this bigger volume and improve the cash profile. *From the press release in May 2022: “For Kalera, the partnership represents an opportunity to allocate up to 50% of its United States production capacity to the restaurant and food service industry. Kalera currently operates farms in the United States in Atlanta, Denver, Houston, and Orlando, as well as in Munich and Kuwait. The company also has five farms under construction in Seattle, Columbus, Ohio, Honolulu, St. Paul, Minn.; and Singapore” said Curtis McWilliams, Chairman-elect and former CEO of Kalera.*

**5.** **SONNY PERDUE IS ON THE BOARD** – Trump’s agriculture man joined the Board a year ago, a big seal of approval for KAL technology IMHO

**6.** **UP TO 50% OF THE EQUITY CAP IS TIED UP.** On my estimates 25-30% is under 12 month SPAC lock-up. Armistice Capital just acquired 10% with some warrants over $4 so they’re not selling. Management owns another 3% or so. Squeeze potential is high once the stock is discovered – the stock went from $2.80 to over $6 in a week in July. Today trading at $1.92.

**7. M&amp;A POTENTIAL IS HIGH.** With KAL having the biggest vertical farming asset base in the US, trading at under half of net invested capital, it could be an M&amp;A target for someone looking to grab market share quickly. KAL’s Vindara seed business is also highly appreciated so could be an attractive target.

VANCOUVER, BC, Sept. 7, 2022 /CNW/ - **Nirvana Life Sciences Inc. (Nirvana or the ""Company"")**  (CSE: NIRV)**, a western Canadian based life sciences company aimed at developing psychedelic therapeutic medicines, including non-addictive chronic pain and relapse preventing pharmaceutical medicines and formulations to be used in trauma work, is pleased to report the development of a more efficient method for producing MDMA.**

Nirvana Life Sciences Inc. is pleased to announce the development of a novel method of producing MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine) that greatly reduces manufacturing time. This 3-step synthesis, starting from the precursor safrole, takes as little as 24 hours to complete, depending upon which method of reduction of the ketone to the secondary amine is being used. This is approximately one third of the time that's required to complete current production methods using iso-safrole as an intermediate. Nirvana has filed an Application with the US Patent Office for this invention.

MDMA was first synthesized in 1912, but it was not researched for its therapeutic potential until just recently. The drug is a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant the varies greatly in effect from other common stimulants found in the same phenethylamine family of compounds. It is currently being studied and used for the treatment of a wide range of psychiatric disorders such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety to name a few. MDMA assisted psychotherapy is currently in phase three clinical trials for the treatment of PTSD in the US, Canada, and Israel. This year the FDA expanded access to MDMA, allowing for its compassionate use in clinical settings by patients who have had no success with other FDA approved treatment options.

MDMA effectively shuts down the brain's fight-or-flight response and creates a sense of empathy in patients, allowing them to process trauma more effectively. The drug increases the amount of serotonin in the synaptic clefts of serotonergic neurons. It also binds to various serotonin receptors and activates them in excess, while simultaneously reducing the reuptake of other neurotransmitters, which is the drugs primary mechanism of action.

Lead chemist and Head of Innovation for Nirvana Life Sciences Inc., Robert August, was one of the first researchers to successfully crystallize MDMA HCl Monohydrate, a novel form of MDMA with increased bioavailability and efficacy. The method of synthesis that he developed can also be seamlessly integrated into the production of MDMA HCl Monohydrate, of which Nirvana Life Sciences Inc. recently announced a patent pending for. With the growing surge in interest in the research of MDMA in the past few years, and the increasing potentials of its use in therapeutic settings, Nirvana believes that this breakthrough is a significant advance in the emerging psychedelic medicines space.

Mr. Robert August stated: ""As a chemist working hard to advance the field of pharmaceutical psychedelics with new and improved therapeutic medications and their methods of manufacturing, bringing this synthesis route and the monohydrate variant forward for research is an important development. Not only will it save time and money in the production of MDMA, but it also works well with the crystallization of MDMA as a monohydrate. It is my hope that this advancement will break down some of the barriers to effective production, research and therapeutic use of these compounds.""

[**Enterprise Group, Inc**](https://enterprisegrp.ca/)**. (TSX: E)** (the **""Company""** or **""Enterprise""**)**.** Enterprise, a consolidator of energy services (including specialized equipment rental to the energy/resource sector), emphasizes technologies that mitigate, reduce, or eliminate CO2 and Greenhouse Gas emissions for small to Tier One resource clients.

*It's been evident for months that a global energy crisis was coming. Then last Monday, just when we thought things couldn't get any worse, the chief executive of Shell predicted that Europe is headed for a multi-winter energy crisis, with consequences that cascade worldwide. (Troy Media)*

While the move to 'Green' energy moves apace, the need for traditional power is immediate, and the market is more prolonged than perceived. The ESP chart is compelling, and the Enterprise Group, YTD price chart, is instructive. As long as more energy is required, the resource sector will likely suffer its own supply/demand for infrastructure company services.

https://preview.redd.it/8z0nbvpo0gm91.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4952d95ab0f95919e515fc6106af075899f2bebc

*To be clear, the* [*energy crisis*](https://time.com/6205391/energy-crisis-europe-power-prices/) *is already here, and Russia is wholly to blame. Natural gas prices topped $3100 per 1000 cubic meters in mid-August, a 610% increase over the same time last year as measured by the Dutch TTF market. Many power stations cannot afford to operate for long at this price. As a consequence of the rising cost of input fuels, European benchmark* [*electricity*](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/europe-energy-crisis-gas-prices-organized-blackouts-power-cuts-uk-2022-8?op=1)\*prices have surged almost 300% in 2022, breaking records. Taken together, energy prices are ten times higher than the five-year average. (\*Time)

It is hard to assess the impact of the shifting energy picture, but the global market will likely take any extra flow we can produce for Canada. PM Trudeau has committed to 300k more barrels of oil by year-end. And needless to say, the Industry is responding with rapid growth and a stunning CAPEX outlook.

Under the mid-case, upstream oil and gas capex in Canada is expected to rise from U.S. $20.7 billion in 2021 to U.S. $22.7 billion in 2022, an increase of nearly 10 percent. Post-2022, the Canadian upstream oil and gas capex is expected to rise even further, reaching over $44.3 billion by 2030.

This should put critical infrastructure companies like Enterprise in high demand: resulting from that rapidly growing market. It also has tenets in the new regime of lower emissions through its [Evolution Power Division](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8apq9EYnL2U).

https://preview.redd.it/jc3vv6eq0gm91.png?width=252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5adfbd7e9be563f3b9e87256c6ad84769c367dfd

*EPP is the leading provider of low emission, portable power systems and associated surface infrastructure to the Energy, Resource, and Industrial sectors. The company's highly innovative methods are delivering its client's low emission natural gas-powered systems and micro-grid technology, allowing clients to eliminate diesel. EPP's systems are equipped to deliver real-time emission metrics providing its clients with the assurances necessary for them to accomplish their ESG reporting and objectives. (PR August 11th)*

Evolution CEO Heather Johnston states, “Our industry-leading 'concept to completion approach to site planning allows the development of a tailored, efficient power grid in even the most remote and rugged terrains. As a result, it eliminates fuel waste and optimizes amperage to reduce emission outputs. Our systems are displacing diesel with cleaner, greener natural gas systems and sustainable options.”

**Bottom Line**

The Enterprise story is relatively straightforward; the right products and services are in immediate and likely ongoing need in the global resource industry, which is facing unprecedented demand and supply challenges. The significant points for investors;

· E.TO trades at CDN$0.40 a share; a steep discount to its CDN$0.64 asset value

· Historical revenue shows an increase/decrease of 0.8% for every 1% change in oil prices.

· Global energy markets will likely remain volatile, but with the renewed aggression by Russia, commodity prices should remain high.

· Enterprise has renewed its share buyback program, which is positive for shareholders.

· Possibility of a takeover/merger could appear due to resource demand, price activity and need for greater amounts of resource infrastructure.

Finally, here are some salient and recent Enterprise information sources for potential investors and current shareholders.

**CARSON CITY, NV / ACCESSWIRE / September 7, 2022 / CECORS, INC. (OTC PINK:CEOS) (""CeCors"" or the ""Company**""), through its wholly-owned subsidiary PsyKey Inc. is pleased to announce it has completed the beta version of its Telehealth App PSYKEY LIVE.

Accessibility to quality mental health support through qualified care providers can be an overwhelming task. According to Whitehouse.gov, an estimated $280 billion was spent on mental health services in the United States in 2020. In Canada, over the past 20 years, mental health costs have increased by 646%, bringing the economic burden to an estimated $51 billion per year, according to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). This cost includes health care, lost productivity, and reductions in health-related quality of life.

The PSYKEY LIVE App was created to streamline accessing mental health support services. The app is designed with ease of use and convenience at the forefront of importance, providing individuals direct access to mental health support providers via video conferencing, live chatting and more. The comprehensive App platform allows users to view profiles of care providers, schedule and track appointments, and create individual private health profiles. These profiles can house users' private health records, medication use information, and any critical notes individuals may wish to disclose to the providers they choose. The PSYKEY LIVE App is now ready for real-world beta testing and will be utilized in various settings to fine-tune and optimize its functionality.

Digital interaction and Telehealth have become more prevalent in recent years, especially under the health restrictions the world is currently dealing with. Not only does digital Telehealth offer convenience to all, but it also affords PSYKEY LIVE the ability to offer support to rural, remote, and high-risk communities across the country, bridging the gap and providing real accessibility."|0.33|0|0|0
t3_x854ry|1662557226|pennystocks|Insider Trading Weekly Update #004: Sector Overviews, Largest Trades, Company/Insider Trends And Weekly Comps From The Past Week|"Morning everyone - Once again is a report/analysis of insider trading activity from the past week. I will be adding more improvements to future posts. Feel free to reply or send a DM with suggestions.

Here are the filtering criteria and additional context on the analysis:

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Direct Open Market Transactions** (Transaction Code of “P” or ”S”) for Form 4 filings with a Transaction Date from **August 29th - September 2nd.** This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line. General consensus is that these transactions have more predictive power than those for RSUs, stock options, warrants etc.
2. Weekly comps are compared to transactions from **August 22nd - August 26th**. So we are comparing the last full week of transactions to the prior full week of transactions.
3. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income funds).

# Layout

1. There are two time horizons, **(1) Snapshot** and **(2) Trend Analysis**. The former aggregates all dates while the latter is broken out by Transaction Date.
2. The report is currently split into 6 sections**:**
   1. Sector-Level Activity
      1. Purchases and Sales
      2. Number of Insiders Buying/Selling
      3. C-Suite Transaction Value
      4. Transaction Counts
   2. Dollar Value of Open Market Transactions (Snapshot/Trend)
   3. Open Market Transaction Counts (Snapshot/Trend)
   4. Top 10 Transactions by Category
      1. Total Purchases (aggregated)
      2. Percent Increase in Shares Owned (individual transaction)
      3. CEO Purchases (aggregated)
      4. CFO Purchases (aggregated)
      5. 10% Owner Purchases (aggregated)
   5. Company-Level Open Market Activity (Snapshot/Trend)
   6. Insider-Level Open Market Activity (Snapshot/Trend)

# Further Context

1. The transaction count/spend for more recent Transaction Dates at times (varies by week) will appear to taper off. This is partly due to a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transaction data. The delay between Filing Date and Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. Banned tickers also impact the N-size though it should generally have a more distributed impact than backfilled transactions.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced from[ Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

# Why is this worth looking at?

As with any dataset, when viewed in isolation this is not going to move the needle. **This is not a silver bullet.**

However I am of the opinion that an appreciation for what insiders (individual + in aggregate) are betting on (or not) is worth being aware of. At least a subset **\*should\*** have a 30,000 foot view of their company, competitors, their sector and the direction that it is headed. In the data lies clues.

This contract alone will be worth $3 million a month in revenues when fully realized. 

 Reliq Health Technologies is a rapidly growing global healthcare  technology company that specializes in developing innovative Virtual  Care solutions for the multi-billion dollar Healthcare market. Reliq’s  powerful iUGO Care platform supports care coordination and  community-based virtual healthcare. iUGO Care allows complex patients to  receive high quality care at home, improving health outcomes, enhancing  quality of life for patients and families and reducing the cost of care  delivery. iUGO Care provides real-time access to remote patient  monitoring data, allowing for timely interventions by the care team to  prevent costly hospital readmissions and ER visits. Reliq Health  Technologies trades on the TSX Venture under the symbol RHT, on the OTC  as RQHTF and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the WKN: A2AJTB. 

HAMILTON, Ontario, Sept. 07, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Reliq Health Technologies Inc. (TSXV:RHT or OTC:RQHTF or WKN:A2AJTB)** (“**Reliq**” or the “**Company**”),  a rapidly growing global healthcare technology company that develops  innovative Virtual Care solutions for the multi-billion dollar  Healthcare market, today announced that it has signed a new contract  with a physician practice network in Florida to onboard over 50,000  patients to its iUGO Care platform by the end of 2023.  


“We are  very pleased to be working with our new client in Florida to improve  health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs for over 50,000 Medicare  patients with chronic conditions,” said Dr. Lisa Crossley, CEO at Reliq  Health Technologies Inc. “Reliq will be providing the full suite of iUGO  Care software along with care management services as needed, and  expects to generate an average revenue of $60 per patient per month at  75% gross margin. Onboarding of these patients has already begun and is  expected to be completed over the next five quarters, by the end of  2023. Our iUGO Care platform is proven to reduce hospitalizations,  improve patient quality of life and generate significant new revenues  for clinicians. Being selected by a large client like this is a  testament to the Company’s strong and growing reputation as a leader in  the virtual care space.”

I did an informational post on why I felt Reliq was one to buy a few weeks ago and this significantly adds to the bull case with a high value contract to help increase the per person net which at $60 is well above the $40 average of many of the past contracts. While struggling in 2022 I expect the company to be much higher at year.

t3_x7hllt|1662488067|pennystocks|"Ever heard of EverGen Infrastructure Corp. (TSXV: EVGN | OTCQB: EVGIF)? Well, I'm glad you asked..."|"Hey all, I’m back, and I just wanted to talk about a company that I recently came across, EverGen **($EVGN)**. Now, I am not a science expert by any means and as such, it took me an embarrassingly long time to break down this business model and what they do....but I suffered so you do not have to.  

&amp;#x200B;

**What do they do?** 

EverGen (TSXV: EVGN | OTCQB: EVGIF) acquires, develops, owns, and operates Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) projects using a platform approach to reliably build sustainable infrastructure to supply the NA gas grid w/clean energy from organic waste. Essentially, they are taking organic waste, running it through something called an Anaerobic Digester and it produces Digestate (become fertilizer, soil, livestock bedding) OR Biogas (our focus today). With the Biogas, it is put through an upgrading process to produce RNG, which is then plugged into the gas grid via fixed long-term contracts with the likes of FortisBC, Enbridge, Union Gas, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What does their operation look like currently?** 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\- 4 owned + operated RNG and/or organic processing facilities   
&gt;  
&gt;\- 11 target development projects (near term)   
&gt;  
&gt;\- $16B potential revenue from FortisBC program 

&amp;#x200B;

**Ok, but explain the business model again...** 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\- Securing long-term contracts w/respect to its feedstock inputs (long-term municipal contracts) + RNG outputs (FortisBC offtake)   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Proven Anaerobic Digester tech which is commonly used in the European mkt   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Executing on a developmental model through a network of strategic partnerships and committed stakeholders   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Utilizing existing natural gas infrastructure (no transition needed for customers)…Proven delivery pipelines 

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial Highlights** 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\- Term sheet w/Roynat &amp; EDC for Senior Term Loan Facility | **$31M**   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Q2 2022 | Strong cash position of **$17.4M to support future growth**   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Y/E as at Dec. 31, 2021 (in CDN 000s) | **Revenue: $9,564**   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Pre-funded CapEx for material EBITDA growth | **$45M** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Notable Industry Info**  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\- Canadian Gas Association Targets | **5% RNG by 2025 &amp; 10% by 2030** (result in 14.0MT emission reductions per year by 2030)   
&gt;  
&gt;\- RNG consumption is expected to increase from **42 PJ in 2018 to 377 PJ in 2040** (CAGR of \~10%)   
&gt;  
&gt;\- North American gas utilities targeting 5**-15% of renewables by volume compared to less than 1% today**   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Global Investment in renewable energy first half of 2022 | **USD $226B (up 11% YoY)** 

&amp;#x200B;

In essence, I am not trying to tell you to start pouring corn oil down our gas tank, I am no social warrior, but I do like seeing and responding to robust investment opportunities like this one. Also, I am always happy to see EDC or BDC (any government affiliated financial entity) providing financing. These finance robust projects they truly feel will be successful and have sound fundamentals. As I often say, some forces seem to be inevitable and this is how I see RNG. It is something that governments have said they will be moving to, gas associations also stating a move to RNG. It all tells the same story."|0.6|1|0|1

https://preview.redd.it/lrjjpj94x9m91.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39c109f53ec157211d8034058f1bd1692978c7af

People have been chasing gold for centuries.  The yellow metal has been a source of wealth for thousands of years and has driven people mad searching for it for just as long.  Generations ago people trekked across the North American continent to stake a claim and mine for gold, risking everything along the way.  Today’s prospectors may not be uprooting their families and heading out to the wild frontier with pickaxes and pans, but they may be on the hunt for gold mining stocks using their computers and screening tools.

As long as there have been gold mining stocks there have been fly-by-night operations that extracted more value from investors’ pockets than from mines, so much due diligence is needed when evaluating potential mining stocks.  A company that has actual prospects and production history is the tiny Canadian company Latin Metals, Inc. (TSXV: LMS) (OTCQB: LMSQF).  This company operates in South America, primarily in Argentina and Peru with projects focused on [gold, copper, and lithium](https://spotlightgrowth.com/latin-metals-tsxv-lms-otcqb-lmsqf-an-undervalued-prospect-generator-with-potential/).  Latin Metals is an exploration stage company, which means that it typically partners with large major integrated producers to extract the minerals it finds.  The $6 million market cap company has been publicly traded since 2009 and was known as Centenera Mining up until 2019.

Partnerships are of paramount importance to tiny exploration companies like Latin Metals since they provide capital to fund exploration.   Latin Metals has agreements with some of the largest and most well-known mining companies like AngloGold ([NYSE: AU](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AU?p=AU&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) and Barrick Gold ([NYSE: GOLD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOLD?p=GOLD&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)).  Latin Metals has optioned three projects to AngloGold in Northern Argentina which are expected to generate cash payments of over $2.5 million over the 5-year option period, of which LMS retains a 20-25% interest.  With Barrick, the company has two projects in Southern Argentina expected to generate about $1.17 million in cash payments and LMS retains a 15-30% interest.  All in all, the company has agreements of $30 million in non-dilutive investment in its projects, as outlined in the latest [investor presentation](https://latin-metals.com/site/assets/files/6641/lms_corporate_presentation_july_2022.pdf).

With tiny companies in the [mining](https://latin-metals.com/) space, investors need all the assurances they can find when evaluating possible positions.  One such assurance is shareholder structure since management should ideally have a big ownership stake in the company to align their interests with shareholders.  Latin Metals’ management team currently owns 49.6% of the company’s shares, so they certainly have skin in the game.  Latin Metals also utilizes third-party companies to validate the feasibility of future properties, which should provide investors an additional degree of comfort, which is important given the sometimes sordid history of gold mining companies.

Diversification is another factor to consider when evaluating possible mining company investments.  The market for gold and other precious metals can swing wildly in terms of price, so having operations in base industrial metals can provide an industrial component to a miner’s portfolio.  Latin Metals has copper projects, mainly in Peru, in the exploration and production stages.  While gold has some industrial uses, it is mainly used in the production of jewelry and for pure investment purposes, especially in times of rising inflation.  For industrial use, copper is arguably the most important metal due to its use in wiring, both for plumbing and electrical.

As the world continues to build and develop, copper will be in demand as every new project, commercial, industrial, and residential will need pipes to carry water and electricity.  Latin Metals currently has 8 copper mining projects in its portfolio, most of which are in the active exploration phase.  Once these projects transition to the partner-ready phase and are optioned, Latin Metals will have an important secondary revenue stream that should give the company a nice balance between precious and base metals.

A small, but important component of the company’s makeup is the Lithium project in Argentina, which is in the partner-ready stage.  Lithium is going to play an outsized role in the world’s transition from the internal combustion engine to the electric motor for automobiles.  Lithium is the main component in the batteries that power electric vehicles, so the mineral is arguably the new oil.  Gasoline-powered cars may have more than a century’s head start on the EV, but the future is unquestionably electric.  Whether by consumer preference or government mandate, the bulk of new vehicle manufacturing will shift to electric within the next decade.  It’s not just EV-specific companies like Tesla ([NASDAQ: TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA?p=TSLA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) that will need massive amounts of lithium, but legacy producers such as Ford ([NYSE: F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F?p=F&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) and General Motors ([NYSE: GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM?p=GM&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) as well since they are in the midst of corporate strategy pivots to make electric vehicles the core of their operations.

Latin Metals is tiny and thinly traded, which means investors need to do their due diligence, but the company looks to be set up for future success.  The partnership with major mining concerns, a large pipeline of projects, and diversification among gold, copper, and lithium make the company one for investors to put on their watchlists."|0.5|0|0|0
t3_x7esob|1662481341|pennystocks|AYVA Part ii… Confessions of an Economic Hitman|"*Disclaimer: AVYA started moving hard out of the gate today (Sept 6th). As a result, we’re up \~20% at right at an important $2 level. With that in mind, I encourage anyone not in the play and thinking about it, to have a plan. I would have preferred to churn this out during a pullback but she’s just straight bussin today. This DD took a decent chunk of time to write, and at this point I just want to post and see what happens. Do your own digging and make your own decisions, don't trust an anon online for everything. Nothing is a forgone conclusion, especially with risky plays like this.*

Hello again fellow travelers. Since last we spoke, we saw the market meltdown and notably AVYA continued its march up with a breakout from consolidation (FUD’ers be damned). At times AVYA was inversing the market completely. So, it seems that the thesis is playing out.

If you missed the last chapter, [catch up here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/x2ik5i/avya_and_basis_risk_blowout/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). For the rest, we’re about to dive deeper into the demigods, demons, and the vulnerable underbelly of the lender, and as promised the float calculation. Here’s a roadmap for what I’ll cover in this post:

1. Recap
2. Float breakdown
3. Hostile takeover
4. Avaya counter offensive

## Basis Risk Blowout

Recap: **I’ve previously presented evidence to support that short shares are part of a convertible hedge** involving shorting AVYA while lending a convertible note. However, these ‘27 notes are not convertible until October 1st resulting in a naked hedge susceptible to excessive losses and margin calls if the underlying moves sharply upward prior to 10/1.

As shown in the Indenture, the notes act as a call option with $3.42 strike. However, **when hedged without convertibility as they are right now, it actually functions as a naked call**. Based on the rise in FINRA shorts, they have essentially sold **73,000 naked calls** at a $3.42 strike!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/11f3ami8l9m91.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96d86a278eeefb32fad6e3aa971a722604ded907

**We’ve seen naked call blowouts on plenty of fan favorites: GME, AMC, NEGG, SPRT, IRNT, SST, etc.** One could say, “they’ll wait it out until the price falls” but the same could be said for all these tickers. The common thread is… time risk. **The market can remain irrational longer than the naked call seller can remain solvent**. And that’s all that matters to see an absolute explosion.

## Float

Last chapter, we breezed past float calculations. Thought it was justified to dive into the finer details.

AVYA has **85.84 mm shares outstanding** ([10Q](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000141810022000047/avya-20220331.htm)) but one needs to comb through some filings and other details to determine float. We got HODL’ers, Show’ers, and Grow’ers.

There are a few swinging HODL’ers in AVYA. The King Theo is the biggest one he just keeps buying the dip. Bought 2mm 8/19 near a cost basis of $0.6-$0.7 and collectively holds 13.2MM shares. The other holders are slothy institutions that wouldn’t know where to find the “dump” button even if they wanted to. Hell, their stake is a protozoan on their balance sheet. **Collectively, they lock up 44.5mm shares**.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f07a94b9l9m91.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e7fa81f34736822e9ff137b6d88261ce87e6c99

(HODL’ers unlikely to sell)

Next up are our Show’ers buying the dip on AVYA. These guys might not be diamond hands but they’ve remained resolute in holding and buying the dip. Their costs basis (&gt;=$7) and it’s probable they would hold until at least $7. **These Show’ers hold 20mm shares.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7ieosiv9l9m91.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8b92a50b48fb16ef5193e367c0b170ae6194cec

(Show’ers buying the dip)

Finally, we got the Grow’er. Masarek (CEO) has been awarded a $4,000,000 sign-on bonus to purchase shares on the open market. Let’s assume it’ll be taxed at 50%. At Fridays closing price, that would buy **1.2 mm shares**. But he hasn’t spent one penny yet because he’s waiting for the final Q3 10Q to file which was preliminarily released to private investors last week. We know the market would calm with filing of the 10Q and rejoice on Masarek’s Form 4. Both these upcoming soon.

All this and the numbers say the following  **the effective float is somewhere around 20 mm \[85.8 - 44.5 - 20 - 1.2 = 20.1\].** If the price rises above $7 the float trade more like 20 - 39mm since the price is now above Show’ers cost bases and these guys may have incentive to exit. Make sense?

**Again based on float of 20mm, the SI is somewhere between 76% (FINRA) and 86% (Ortex).** That is why you will see Ortex reporting 100% utilization at these short levels.

If you haven’t then allow me to introduce you to one of the biggest predatory lenders there is. **Apollo is a large asset management firm.** These guys have (or had) their hands in the pot of recent upside corner cases in the market including GME, AMC, RDBX, REV and… now AVYA.

Apollo operates with the same modus operandi as in *Confessions of an Economic Hitman*. **They swoop in to distressed companies, gain a foothold, and then exert pressure on management for Apollo’s (not the company’s) immediate financial gain**. They start by stepping out of the shadow to woo a company in desperate need of financing. They provide the lifeline loan and seek to take a large position as the primary lender in order to poison the well. **Once established, Apollo attempts to convince or otherwise force management to file bankruptcy so that as the primary creditor, Apollo has first rights to the assets**. This allows them to more immediately liquidate assets and pillage the corporation. There’s a book on this topic that actually is a fascinating read, as this type of strategy is also used widely by NGO’s to exploit developing nations.

**More recently, they’ve tried to conceal their foul practices by fronting via Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld law firm**. Akin is their henchman. See, Apollo got smart in 2021 when retail apes fought back. They covered their tracks by sending Akin to do their bidding. No “Apollo” title attached to their activities.

**Let’s use AMC as an example**. You know the story, COVID descends and brick-and-mortar crater. **Apollo strategically accumulates a large position In AMC’s first lien debt.** So when the business hit a liquidity brick wall, it leaked a news story that **demanded AMC file bankruptcy in early December 2020**. This would have destroyed shareholder value and left Apollo as the first lien, aka first in line under bankruptcy. AMC fought back.

AMC strong-armed Apollo alongside retail apes by late Jan 2021 (and beyond). Anyone remember those days? **AMC managed to raise nearly $1b without Apollo to keep the busy alive despite Apollo’s takeover attempt.**

## Poison in the Well

**For AVYA, the story goes back to late 2019 when they needed a cash infusion**. Rumors surfaced that Apollo was looking at an unsolicited acquisition of Avaya. **At the time, AVYA untethered the claws of Apollo by signing a partnership with RingCentral.** RingCentral provided the necessary financing via $125mm convertible loans (at $16 a share) and $375mm cash advance for expected costs and licensing rights. Apollo was averted, for now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fast forward to Summer 2022, AVYA is seeking financing to roll off 2023 notes.** The practice is typical for any business to refinance its debt. The first tranche financing had a Standstill Clause. **Standstill clauses are incorporated into contracts to prevent hostile takeovers by the counterparty. Interestingly, when the second tranche was issued on 6/24, this clause… poof, just magically disappeared and this is where bloodsucking Apollo enters**. Ol’ Jimmy (reminder: he’s the now-fired, old, shitty CEO who drove AVYA into the muck) had made a deal with the Devil.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w5pshyvdl9m91.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ab0cdc0090d569fab8625eee55e39698a836980

**Subsequently, Apollo loaded the boat on ‘28 notes.** Think about it, why would a lender sell for cents on the dollar when they hold first lien. The answer is because reputable lenders can’t hold onto CCC rated loans; they can’t keep that on the balance sheet. So in comes Apollo to gobble them up for $0.50 on the dollar. **As first lien, Apollo just bought a ticket to the front of the line.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7t938ogel9m91.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54d3e7929a5a21f1c8b84a0453ee9897b733223b

After AVYA canned Jimmy and withheld the 10Q, guess who showed up? Akin Gump. Apollo sent its minion to push its plan to the next phase. **Apollo was looking to finish the job it started in 2019.** However, retail had punished Apollo enough times so Apollo has been careful to conceal its identity this time via Akin.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zs0srs1fl9m91.jpg?width=304&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c22d644f8392086cf96b89f1a4456bf3a621e64f

**Out of the blue, a story breaks that Akin has filed a letter against AVYA presumably demanding they immediately declare bankruptcy.** The article itself has a few key details that smell suspicious.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2za69zofl9m91.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=619e1d0a0e8d4b8cfae5d9b43dedc13e30a42529

**At this point, key details are not public information.** So ask yourself, if Avaya, Goldman (broker), and Akin aren’t talking to Bloomberg, then who the hell is “this group” providing non-public details to some random reporter? Who would have that kind of motivation? In fact, first lien holder scumbag Apollo (and perhaps someone inside AVYA leaking FUD to assist Apollo in their efforts…).

**Bloomberg and WSJ cite false information that the filing deadline is mid-September.** Funny how there’s no date on something so important. In fact, the indenture has no such clauses and normal SEC 60 day requirements apply. That would actually put the deadline all the way back to Nov 30th.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fspsryihl9m91.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d23d6cf584b90ba05aac672f8c83925325dc4a5

This is not Apollo’s first hostile takeover and they have various weapons in their arsenal. **It’s very possible they execute a massive short exercise when the 10Q files to shake SLs and sentiment loose**. *Remember that we already know the 10Q will have abysmal results, this is priced in. Therefore, the filing does not justify a further price drop unless there is foul play.*

## Counter Offensive

There are multiple variables Apollo did not foresee and this is the reason the AVYA setup is unique. **For once, Apollo may have bit off more than they can chew.**

**We know the board of directors (BOD) does not want to file bankruptcy.** Despite crooked Apollo, BOD just gave Masarek $4mm to buy shares on the open market pending 10Q. The BOD wants Masarek incentivized to file the 10Q, take equity upside, and lead the company forward. **AVYA will move to file the 10Q and unlock an enormous amount of liquidity ($743mm).**

**Masarek wants to turn the company around and has the skills/experience to do so.** He’s a corporate mercenary that gets shit done. This was proven when he 3x’d Vonage during his tenure and digital transformation there. **Masarek has expressed on multiple occasions that he wants to focus on the digital transformation, not get locked up in a bankruptcy battle.**

**Other lenders and hedge funds are completely opposed to Apollo.** ‘23 note holders most certainly want AVYA to pay off asap so they can GTFO. These creditors are last in line in a bankruptcy and don’t want to be left holding the bag. In addition, Brigade Capital holds the other half of the ‘27 convertible notes but are restricted by a Standstill clause. They stand to gain the most from a moon mission. Lastly, other hedge funds per the 13F filings, want upward price action since they just bought the dip.

**Options market shows strength with gamma continuing to build on and up the option chain.** Right now, the net hedged is 2MM shares (10% FF). However, there’s quite a bit upside above $2. In fact, the **massive OI on the $8c has the highest acceleration between $3 and $6** (already proved BTO).

&amp;#x200B;

**It is possible that Apollo does not understand its target this time. First, management is not friendly to Apollo**. That includes Masarek, BOD, and Theo. **Second, Apollo has significant exposure from their basis risk via short positions (73,000 naked calls) leading up to Oct 1st that they thought they could keep concealed**. **Third, their counterparts both lenders and hedge funds are completely opposed to Apollo’s agenda**. These parties stand to gain the most by upward price action. Essentially. Apollo has adversaries its own size. **Lastly, Apollo does not want a AMC/GME repeat so they’ve specifically tried to keep hidden from the media and from retail investors.** They know the hedgie carnage that can be incited. **The secret’s out….**

&amp;#x200B;

## TL;DR

Check out [part i](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/x2ik5i/avya_and_basis_risk_blowout/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) for additional details. In this chapter, we’ve revealed substantially material details that enhance the thesis:

1. Based on the indenture, the equivalent of 73,000 calls have been sold short until October 1st by the ‘27 lender due to convertibility lock up.
2. Detail float calculations show free float is 20mm equating to 76-86% SI and 100% utilization.
3. The lender of interest is… scumbag Apollo who has attempted a hostile takeover of companies like AMC and GME.
4. Apollo has tried to secretly launch a takeover campaign of AVYA by accumulating first lien debt and leaking info to news outlets.
5. Apollo had not anticipated insiders’ disinterest in bankruptcy, opposition from other lenders and hedge funds, bullish gamma building on the option chain, and their enormous naked call risk being exposed for all to see and subsequently challenged.

This may sound Mr Robot’esque and I am in fact surprised how deep this goes, and that I am here writing to a wider audience. I believe the facts about Apollo and Avaya speak for themselves – even Theordore sees it. Similarly, I don’t believe there are any rational, value-oriented investors left to push Avaya down at these price levels, and this line of thought led me down the rabbit hole investigating the Apollo connection.

Contrary to the tickers Apollo has previously been involved with which had real issues like most of retail/malls bankrupt, Avaya is in a very different situation with recurring revenue, and given Apollo's history of landing itself in sticky situations this makes the setup particularly explosive.  At the very minimum from this post take away the float calculation of 20mm shares which equates to 76-86% SI.

Indeed almost 400,000 shares were traded during last week’s session, worth five times more than usual sessions (the daily average is 77k). As you might read on investors’ forums, “is there something brewing”? Was a piece of relevant information shared during the last company’s webinar? Until we discover the following news release, it would be great to do a small recap of the company’s previous highlights.

https://preview.redd.it/7rmv8v9i39m91.png?width=348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93fa2593a13919f78e0e6aa1322e7ee60f0e0974

## But First, Why is Fandifi’s Technology Innovative?

Fandifi Technology is a pure, innovative tech play. On the one hand, the company builds a crowd-based and system-generated prediction and fan engagement platform. On the other hand, Fandifi operates an NFT marketplace where rewards can be bought, sold, or traded on an interoperable blockchain agnostic platform.

Why is it very strategic to hold an engagement platform? In our modern era, streaming platforms appear to be the new media winners. The Wall Street Journal states, “Sports leagues, especially Major League Baseball, are seeing declines in younger viewership. The change comes as people turn away from traditional TV viewing and toward social media, video games, and streaming TV”. Numbers approve the trend. Western game streaming reached 8.8 billion hours viewed in Q1, representing an 80% increase year-over-year. In the USA, back in June 2021, cable television accounted for 40.1% of all video viewing. One year later, cable’s share had dropped by five points to 35.1%.

Conversely, in June 2022, streaming video exceeded one-third (33.7%) of all video viewing for the first time, a sizable increase from the 27.4% share just one year ago. The viewing share of streaming video has risen every month since March increasing four share points during that time. The shares of broadcast television stood at 22.4% in June, the lowest over the past twelve months.

Fandifi’s unique technology brings engagement for creators and fans that enables deeper connections with live content through several platforms. The company has built the leading Fan Engagement prediction technology that encourages and rewards users for being the most significant &amp; wisest fans. Fandifi’s platform turns casual fans into Superfans by allowing them to become part of the action going head to head with other fans in support of their favorite content creator or team. To reach a broader audience, the company operates on Android and IOS mobile devices and has an Exclusive Sports &amp; Esports license for purpose -built Unified Information Access (UIA) platform. In simple words, it is the league for the fans.

David is a seasoned capital markets professional involved in numerous aspects of corporate management and deploying capital market strategies for publicly listed companies. David is a focused, determined, competent member of management and advisory boards of companies in the gaming, esports, gaming, technology, fintech, and natural resource sectors.

On August 11, Fandifi hosted a webinar presented by David Vinokurov (CEO &amp; president). David Vinokurov presented the company’s story, including an overview of current operations and upcoming milestones. He also provided a live demonstration of the Fandifi platform highlighting the prediction and gamification capabilities for streamed and broadcast content. Once the presentation was done, investors we able to ask many questions. One of the most interesting ones was about partnerships. David Vinokurov said they would arrive soon. All we need is an official news release to state this declaration.

Extremely bullish signal of upside.**

As the headline states, a hedge fund called Castleknight Management has taken a major stake in PRTY. They now hold 4.3% of shares outstanding -- it is one of their largest bets in their diversified portfolio.

Why is this bullish? A few reasons.

1. **PEDIGREE** -- Castleknight was founded in 2020 by Aaron Weitman. Aaron Weitman was at Appaloosa Management for 15 years, leaving after serving as a Senior Partner to start his own fund. This is notable because Appaloosa is David Tepper's fund, and Weitman was essentially Tepper's protege. David Tepper's reputation precedes itself -- he is absolute legend in the hedge fund space, and consistently has had one of the most successful funds. The fact that he groomed Weitman speaks volumes, and Weitman has backed it up -- in his first year of operation his Special Situations Fund gained 64%.

2. **STRATEGY** -- Expanding on Tepper, one of the things he is well known for and made a boatload off of is investing in distressed assets. PRTY, of course, has taken a beating in part because of its trouble over the past few years and accumulation of debt. Therefore, we can assume Weitman and his team are extremely well groomed to identify opportunity with these sorts of companies and exploit it for maximum returns.

3. **PORTFOLIO STAKE** -- When you look at Castleknight's portfolio, PRTY is one of their top ten holdings (excluding ETFs and options). Further, while they initiated their position in Q4 2021, they have actually doubled down. **Rather, they have quintupled down.** Since then they have increased their stake 465%, **accumulating a total of ~4.8M shares.** Not only that, but they are doing this amid a clearly bearish take on the market. 34% of their portfolio is allocated to puts on SPY -- they know where the market is going. Despite this, they still see tremendous upside for PRTY amid a down cycle.

It means that wealthier customers are still consuming, and customers that are in the middle to the lower class are feeling the brunt of rate hikes, and the commodity squeeze, I will get into that more later. These stable sales will come to bring Vera Bradley more revenue when the economy eventually stabilizes, which it already is.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cargo Prices have been going Down for the Last Year and Should Eventually Reach Pre Covid Levels, Lowering the Cost of Revenue for Product Transported From China**

&amp;#x200B;

Not very much to explain here. This will lower shipping costs for Vera Bradley. Actually, in Q4 of the last year, at the height, shipping costs took away about 1/3 of their earnings, **"" The incremental freight costs and GSP impact combined affected our EPS by approximately $0.25 for the full year. Excluding these two items would have put earnings in line with our original guidance of $0.80 to $0.90.""** Freight costs are still about 3X the mean in 2019, so the reduction in it will be beneficial.

&amp;#x200B;

**Oil Prices:**  Gas prices have affected the revenue of the lower-middle class of Vera Bradley's customer base. It has also affected their freight operation. Oil prices are actively lowering, so it will both lower costs of revenue and will increase revenue itself.

&amp;#x200B;

**New CEO:** I dunno, they're on a search for a new CEO. They may steer the company in another direction. Just something to keep in mind for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cost Cutting/Balance Sheet:** Vera Bradley wants to do $25 million worth of cost-cutting this year. This means cutting off the fat on employees and through the manufacturing process. Vera Bradley's balance sheet is absolutely magical. Even though it is mostly comprised of inventory, I think that the demand for it makes it liquid.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z556e5hsi5m91.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d23cc60dc742904de73c30b14381aad202a0e93b

&amp;#x200B;

**But what about the earnings crash, you may say?** What about it? Vera Bradley still increased their revenue by about $30 million as the economy is crawling toward a new normal. Oil prices are going down, and rates, too. Obviously, those may be a risk, too, but I don't think it'll affect it much. You've seen the revenue chart, it is relatively unchanged from when cash was practically free."|0.5|0|0|0
t3_x6x645|1662427408|pennystocks|1 Stock to Buy this Week that is Breaking Out... $NU(NuBank) ... Full Update- Prob the last time it will qualify as Penny Stock (below $5)... How Brazil Central Bank's PIX program led to the Fast Growing Fintech in the World..|"Nubank has been able to catch lightning in a bottle to become the fastest growing Fintech in the World... thanks to a top notch CEO/Founder &amp; Management team, The brazilian Central Banks implementation of the PIX system, followed by Legacy Bank closures during the pandemic. 

And have a highly lucrative business model (currently around $5B in free cash)... similar to Amazon in early stages- NuBank CEO has stated that they can be profitable at any point- but are currently using profits to expand and grow market shares throughout South America- to take advantage of their dominant positions &amp; their industry record breaking low cost of customer acquisition.


**Why has Share Price Fallen?**

$NU is a Brazilian Fintech that went Public the end of last year- and its share price fell in tandem with the overall market the first half of 2022.  Also, due to the general malaise the down market created &amp; its operations being exclusively outside the US... NuBank has been off the radar of most retail investors and is just starting to gain visibility. 

(Institutional investors include Warren Buffett, Cathy Wood, and Tencent who bought at IPO around $10 ...(Double the current $5 price). Masa Son recently jumped on board as well. (Institutional Ownership is listed on Yahoo as  68% of the Float).


**Why Now is the time to Jump In?**

Shares have been steadily coiling the past Coiling/ Accumulating the past 3 months, since Bottoming at the start of Summer (originally moving up along with the overall market- and continue to hold strong the past several weeks as the market has dipped). And Friday- NU entered a breakout zone (see chart).

So- $NU is very likely to start a strong move back to $10 IPO price (or higher).  Even if this ends up taking a few more weeks, it is unlikely to move much lower... and will likely make a quick jump when it does break out in ernest- which buy will miss if they have to chase it. 

(Also- just as a potential side bonus..although not the reason Nu is such a strong buy currently...Nu may also get a small squeeze effect from the 100M short positions at the begging of the breakout (hard to tell... but consider: $Float is 2.2B shares... 77% of which is owned by Institutional Investors ($68%) &amp; Insiders (9%). Additionally-  there were 7.5M Fails to Delivery mid August (last reported period) &amp; daily short volume ratio has been close to 60% in the two weeks since the last 8/15 short report (Total traded volume those two weeks was close to 500M).


**NuBank- Brief Business Overview**

NuBank got its start when its Founder moved by to Brazil, went to open a bank account, and saw how Byzantine the process was.

Nu started by offering a digital solution that made it easier for customers to bank in Brazil - by offering lower cost products and services than the large traditional Brazilian banks. 

*****But the Explosion for Nubank really ignited thanks to 1) the Central Bank establishing the PIX system for citizens to receive their benefits (sort of like Venmo)... 2) then the pandemic, which closed most traditional banks, thus leaving citizens with access to PIX.  (NuBank stepped in to provide a digital solution that could access PIX).

----&gt; As a result, Nu has provided millions of customers with their first-ever credit cards and bank accounts. Now the digital bank is spreading like wildfire in Brazil and starting to expand throughout Latin America, a region that many consider to be one of the next big banking markets, with more than 666 million people.

As of 2nd quarter, Nu now has more than 65 million customers (roughly 36% of the Brazilian adult population). Roughly 55% of these active customers are using Nu's Digital Bank as their primary bank.
Most impressive is that a lot of this growth is organic, which has given Nu an industry-low customer acquisition cost around $5 per customer (which is virtually unheard of). Also Nu's servicing cost per customer is 85% lower than traditional banks.

Nu has also successfully starting to grow in other parts of Latin America and is now the No. 1 new issuer of credit cards in Mexico and Colombia.

(***I will post a good overview article of PIX/ Pandemic/ Nubank scenario .. in comments)

Soo like myself this one here has lost around 99% of it’s value this year, but there is a difference, i can’t understand why this happened.

It’s basically a french company with a Stage 3 pharmaceutical that showed all the way good results and will be finished in a year. This pharmaceutical will help people who are suffering to CMT Type 1A ((CMT1A is a demyelinating inherited peripheral neuropathy characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy in arms and legs, leading to progressive motor disability and sensory loss) &lt;—-yeah i copied this) and that are around 1,5 Million worldwide. If i looked everything correctly up this will be the only pharmaceutical on the Market when it comes out for this disease. Also it will be needed permanent use because it stops the disease from worsening.
And this pharmaceutical is not their only one, they are developing also others and one is a pharmaceutical for Alzheimer and had been tested a few years ago till a Phase 2a study and is till then developed further through partnerships.

So here are a few numbers Number:

Actual price: 0,0009€
ATH= 29,20€ (01.02.2019)
Split= 0 
Market Capitalization= 1,34 Million €
Debts~ 12 Million €


Sooo what have i missed? Why has it lost so much value? Will this one bring me nearer to bankruptcy or is it a buy and hold?"|0.5|0|0|0

“Chembio has a track record of delivering testing solutions for three recent infectious disease outbreaks with the expedited development rapid point-of-care tests. This includes the rapid development of a Zika product for the U.S. market, when the Zika outbreak was impacting the United States in 2017. The company also developed a DPP Ebola test to help with the outbreak with Ebola in 2018. This was followed by the development of COVID tests when the pandemic hit the U.S. in 2020. Additionally, Chembio has developed rapid point-of-care DPP diagnostic tests for HIV 1/2 and Syphilis with the introduction of STAT PAK and SURE CHECK.

Currently, the FDA has cleared one test to detect monkeypox, offered through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a lab developed test (LDT). The test utilizes a swab sample from a monkeypox lesion, creating the need for earlier detection to limit the spread of the disease and expedite treatment.”


Two weeks after this PR they were awarded a CDC government contract for $3.25 mill. No official PR has been released yet, so no details on what the contract entails.. YET. Chembio has made tests for every international outbreak since 2016. If this CDC contract is for a monkeypox test we could see a huge move. 

Things to know:

-Currently trading at .674 AH

-Chembio is currently trading under cash value.

-US government contracts of this value is not a regular thing so next quarters revenue will increase from Q2.

-Chart looks like it’s about to break current downtrend. Curling up on the monthly and bouncing off oversold on the RSI. 

-This company has never done a RS since joining NASDAQ is 2012 

-OS were just under 10 mill initially and now stands just over 30 million shares.

t3_x4f8st|1662160088|pennystocks|VerifyMe (VRME)|"I found this really interesting and I thought some of you might like it as well. 
Forgive my post as the DD isn't as deep as I'd like, but I'm only going to hit on the top points.

VRME is currently trading at $1.50.
Shares outstanding 8.5m
This is in the area of the lowest price or loading area. Vanguard also took a position that was filed on August 31st.

Two analyst's have a PT of $7 and $8.

VerifyMe is a company that supports supply chain operations through the use of item tracking technology. 

What's interesting about this is that they're able to track a parcel within 2ft of its actual location and each tracking device is unique to each item.

They've been in this business for the last 20 years and haven't been very profitable. The last earnings reported in August were a dismal 260k for 
qtr 2. 

That's until they're acquisition of PeriShip was finalized on August 31st. PeriShip also operates under a similar niche. They ship items that require constant oversight and require temperature controlled conditions. Examples would be food and pharmaceuticals.

PeriShip earnings were $4.2 million for quarter two, which brings the combined earnings of both companies at $4.5 million.

VRME finally, after 20 years, has made to a point where they can be profitable and develop serious growth in specific niches within the supply chain arena.

VRME can use PeriShips assets to also deliver pharmaceuticals and narcotics that will require each item to be serialized and tracked due to the upcoming FDA mandate coming in 2023.
Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA).



TL;DR
With PeriShip and the current shares outstanding, 8.5m, I believe that VRME could reach a minimum of $6.00. 
If we calculate the revenue $4.5 million times four quarters, equals $18 million. 
$18 million times four is $72 million. (which most stocks trade 4 times annual revenue.)And then again divide 72 by 8.5 we get 8.47. this represents a 450% gain. 
Personally $6 is my target price."|0.9|24|0|24

**Let’s talk Uranium. And Nuclear Power.**

*Uranium is a highly dense metal which occurs in most rocks and is mainly used as a fuel in nuclear power plants. The standard contract unit is 250 pounds of U3O8 and is traded on New York Mercantile Exchange. Top uranium producers are Kazakhstan, Canada and Australia.* 

Even though the economic US powers that be would have us believe energy prices are correcting downward, the reality of the recent price shock is complicated. World energy prices have been keenly lied to world events and the ensuing economic fallout.

Germany pivoted from its usual stance against nuclear energy and signalled it might prolong the life of online plants, while Japan could restart reactors to avert a power crunch ahead of the winter and double its current operating fleet. In the meantime, investors continue to monitor supplies of enriched uranium from Russia, as the US said it would subsidize uranium from western producers to utilities, and Canada banned exports from Russia.

**Need more proof?**

(Trading Economics)*

Between the 3 Mile Island meltdown in 1979 and Chornobyl in 1986, Nuclear power has had a lasting stench with the consumer even though technology virtually assures these incidents will not happen again.

**Let's talk about Bill Gates.** 

Of particular interest for investors is the renewed interest in Uranium, which is in no small measure due to recent comments made by billionaires such as Elon Musk and the investment activities of others in next-generation nuclear power, such as Bill Gates. Musk twittered the critical nature of nuclear to national security, and Gates, Bezos et al. have invested in next-generation atomic startups.

Bill has been busy developing state-of-the-art and safe nuclear power. He is ready to build his first facility.

·  Bill Gates’ TerraPower has chosen Kemmerer, Wyoming, a frontier-era coal town, as the site where the company will build its first demonstration nuclear power plant.

·  The plant will cost about $4 billion, half coming from TerraPower and half coming from the United States government, the company said.

·  Will operate the plant, which will play a role in the power company's decarbonization strategy.

Rocky Mountain Power — a PacifiCorp division owned by Berkshire Hathaway Energy — Once built, the plant will provide a baseload of 345 megawatts, with the potential to expand its capacity to 500 megawatts.

For reference, 1 gigawatt, or [1,000 megawatts, of energy will power a midsize city](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/14/bill-gates-concepts-to-understand-the-climate-crisis.html), and a small town can operate on about 1 megawatt, according to a rule of thumb Microsoft co-founder Gates provided in his recent book, “[How to Avoid a Climate Disaster](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/633968/how-to-avoid-a-climate-disaster-by-bill-gates/)."" He wrote that the United States uses 1,000 gigawatts, and the world needs 5,000 gigawatts.

PEGA

Pegasus has well represented in NE Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan, with a resource estimate of over 200k tons which means about 535k pounds of uranium. Within the basin, PEGA holds:

* Wollaston Northeast: 7 claims, 34,721 ha
* Bentley Lake: 3 claims, 12,397 ha
* Mozzie Lake: 3 claims, 6,908 ha
* Pine Channel: 1 claim

The IEA World Energy Outlook predicts a 52% increase in electricity demand from 2020 to 2040, with a 75% increase predicted from 2020 to 2050.

There is increasing recognition that nuclear power, with its clean emissions profile, reliable and secure baseload characteristics and low, Levelized cost, has a vital role in achieving decarbonization goals. (Cameco.com)

While investors are likely still weighing the viability of Nuclear power, Uranium and PEGA represent an excellent way to own an extremely well-managed company located in one of the premier areas for safe extraction. They also have impressive 'closeology' to many of the world's most significant suppliers of future feedstocks to an energy source that can no longer be ignored or eschewed.

The word nuclear  'proxy' comes to mind, not to mention good uranium exposure at a very reasonable share price."|1.0|9|0|9

Eco-friendly plastic recycling with superior technology - On track for a billion-dollar valuation?  Closing price (8/31/2022): 0.84 CAD  1st price target: 2.00 CAD by the end of September 2023  2nd price target: 5.75 CAD by the end of September 2024  Buy until 1.00 CAD  Market capitalization: CAD 46.2 million / cash balance at the end of February 2022: approximately CAD 1.2 million (+ CAD 4.2 million fresh equity from two private placements completed in April and July 2022 at CAD 0.70 and CAD 0.72 per unit, respectively)  Trading venues: including Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Lang &amp; Schwarz, Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE)  Introduction  According to United Nations (UN) estimates, 400 million tons of plastic waste are produced worldwide each year. Only 9 percent of this is recycled, according to the UN. The rest ends up in landfills, is incinerated or floats into the oceans via rivers.  There are many different plastics, even though everything looks like plastic to us. The six most economically important polymers alone each consist of different basic building blocks that are not always chemically compatible with each other.  The main problem with plastic recycling is quality. Recycled plastic is almost always low-quality plastic. And recycling only works well for certain types of plastic, namely those that can be shredded and melted, then pressed into new shapes.   But many plastics can't simply be melted down and recast. Some become unusable due to chemical reactions, while others react with tiny residual contaminants that are difficult to remove.  Currently, plastic recycling is not profitable without government funding. 80-90 percent of plastic cannot be recycled using current methods.  There are now dozens of companies (including Quantafuel) involved in plastic recycling, relying on different processes (high-temperature methods: pyrolysis and thermolysis / chemical recycling with solvents: Solvation and Solvolysis).   The choice of the particular process depends strongly on the composition and contamination of the feedstock.  More than 30 years ago, pyrolysis was already considered as the process to fight the plastic flood. However, the technical and economic problems were already so great at that time that the plants were closed down again, sometimes with enormous losses.   Pyrolysis is costly, energy-intensive and unsustainable. Especially in light of the current energy crisis, large corporations are looking around for better alternatives.  Today's new recommendation has found a novel solution to the problems pyrolysis faces. This approach opens up entirely new possibilities.   In doing so, the company is targeting three giant markets:   1) Plastics recycling (global market potential: $45 billion),   2) Upgrading heavy oil to lighter oil (global market potential: $50 billion), and   3) Converting renewable oils to higher-value fuels (global market potential: $121 billion).  What makes Aduro Clean Technologies so special?  Aduro develops unique, water-based technologies for the chemical recycling of plastic waste, the conversion of heavy crude oil and bitumen into lighter, more valuable oil, and renewable oils into higher-value fuels.  The Hydrochemolytic™ process has significant advantages over traditional technologies.  - Low operating expenses (OPEX) and capital expenditures (CAPEX).  - 50 percent lower costs than traditional processes  - the process is therefore also suitable for smaller plants  - modular design to meet throughput requirements without compromising economics / it can be expanded as needed (scalability)  - reduced energy requirements with maximized yields  - low emissions = best value compared to traditional technologies  - the process can be customized for processing different raw materials and optimizing product quality to meet the customer's needs|0.63|2|0|2

Last week I wrote my DD on insider buying of $PRTY. I always take insider accumulation as a bullish signal. I also added that I would reach out to CAS Investment Partners to see whether they would be willing to share any of their notes on why they have invested so heavily.

It turns out the information has been hiding in plain sight! Lance Ettus, an analyst of 8 years (whose background speaks for itself) published his personal thesis on the $PRTY opportunity.

LINK: https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/PARTY_CITY_HOLDCO_INC/2834341555

I will not re-hash all of the points here, but the TLDR is that the bull case for $PRTY indicates a 5-year price target of $30+. This article was published on March 31st, so the bullets here actually understate the upside (as share price then was $3.65).

Some key bullets on the opportunity...

*PRTY is a category leading retailer through marketing scale and a large advantage in selection, but it makes nearly all its operating margin through a wholesale distribution business, a fact that is obscured by the company’s accounting.

*PRTY’s wholesale business (Amscan) is a great business, similar to other distributors like Fastenal (FAST) and WW Grainger (GWW). Amscan enjoys multiple deep competitive advantages through scale, breadth of product, licensing relationships and patents.

PRTY is extremely internet resistant and arguably internet proof because its low-price products make it “un-Amazonable” since the prices charged by the internet behemoth are much higher than PRTY. Additionally, balloons, which make up approximately 30% of retail gross profit, cannot be sold effectively online.
*PRTY’s sales weakness over the last few years has been the result of several factors such as a shift in the calendar for Halloween, growing competition from big box stores, a helium shortage, and the ebbing of the Frozen phenomenon, all of which should be ending or reverting.

*PRTY’s turnaround has been slowed by a combination of the pandemic and a customer base that shows up under 2 times per year thus slowing the gains from experiments within the store. The improvements PRTY is making should be ongoing and compound over time.

*PRTY trades at roughly 4X current year EPS!! But we think it is just above 2X 2023 earnings power of roughly $1.50 per share! We think shares will rise to at least $30 in 5 years and thus upside is over 700%!!

**Supply/Demand Outlook**

**Current Demand**: About 440 reactors with a combined capacity of about 390 GWe require some 74,000 tonnes of uranium oxide concentrate containing about 62,500 tonnes of uranium (U) from mines (or the equivalent from stockpiles or secondary sources) each year.

**Current Supply**: Mines in 2020 supplied some 56,287 tonnes of uranium oxide concentrate (U3O8), containing 47,731 to 74% of the utilities' annual requirements ( [World Uranium Mining](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production.aspx)).

*The IEA World Energy Outlook predicts a 52% increase in electricity demand from 2020 to 2040, with a 75% increase predicted from 2020 to 2050.*

*There is increasing recognition that nuclear power, with its clean emissions profile, reliable and secure baseload characteristics and low, Levelized cost, has a vital role in achieving decarbonization goals.*(Cameco.com)

**This factoid is fascinating, also from Cameco**;

*Utility customers do not come to the market right before they need to load uranium into their reactors. To operate a reactor that could run for more than 60 years, natural uranium and the downstream services must be purchased years in advance, allowing time for several processing steps before it arrives at the power plant as a finished fuel bundle.*

Of particular interest for investors is the renewed interest in Uranium, which is in no small measure due to recent comments made by billionaires such as Elon Musk and the investment activities of others in next-generation nuclear power, such as Bill Gates. Musk twittered the critical nature of nuclear to national security, and Gates, Bezos et al. have invested in next-generation atomic startups.

Pegasus CEO and President Charles Desjardin stated, *""We feel the global uranium market should continue to build strength as the push for green energy alternatives accelerate. As we build our diversified uranium portfolio, we continue evaluating uranium assets in Canada and the United States. Given the current geopolitical climate, uranium demand should continue to accelerate.""*

Pegasus is a developing story with good properties in an age of renewed interest and the need for sustainable electricity generation. Nuclear’s time has likely come, and the Company as the new kid on the block finds itself betwixt and between. Previous work has shown the potential in a premier U308 area.

**Bottom Line**

War in Ukraine and ramped-up global warming/climate concerns make a case for owning modest –for now--PEGA—at a CDN$0.06 and market cap of CDN$5.42 million, potential growth or perhaps takeover candidate.

It seems Pegasus is in a suitable political climate and has properties in a skookum area, globally speaking."|0.6|1|0|1

(TSXV: TMET) (""Torr"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce the compilation results of 722 historical soil samples within the Dalvenie Zone that has defined an extensive 2.1 km2 mineralized footprint, measuring 1500 metres (m) by 1400 m, of &gt;100 parts per million (ppm) copper (Cu) that remains open for drill testing. Within this footprint Torr has also delineated four highly anomalous &gt;300 ppm copper soil anomalies that individually measure up to 1200 m strike-length with a minimum width of 250 m.

The four highly anomalous soil trends either extend or parallel known copper-gold mineralization identified at-surface in 9 historical rock grab samples that yielded assays &gt;1 % Cu and 7 samples that contained &gt;1 gram per tonne (g/t) gold (Au). The highest-grade historical rock grab sample yielded an assay of 8.86 % Cu, 6.45 g/t Au, and 62.4 g/t silver (Ag). Anomalous copper-gold values appear to be coincident with extensive north-trending mineralized shear-vein systems and polymictic breccias in spatial proximity to contacts between the Late Triassic Gnat Lake ultramafic intrusion and surrounding Stuhini Group volcanics, suggesting a potential multi-kilometre-scale fertile geological setting for concentration of mineralization.

The Dalvenie Zone is located \~8 km south of the Company's Gnat Pass Copper-Gold Porphyry deposit and is road-accessible via a 2-kilometre (km) gravel road from Highway 37. Torr's 100% owned 689 km2 Latham Project is situated within a highway-accessible region of the prolific Golden Triangle of northern British Columbia.

*Malcolm Dorsey, President and CEO, commented, ""Our historical compilation work within the highly prospective Dalvenie Zone has been very successful in identifying undrilled targets within a significant 2.1 km2* *mineralized footprint that has substantial potential to increase with assays pending from our completed 2022 Phase 1 geochemical survey. The consistency in surface geochemistry with multiple paralleling soil and rock grab sample anomalies suggests the Dalvenie Zone contains a robust copper-gold system that could be a considerable new discovery adjacent to Highway 37, providing significant upside potential to our imminent 2022 inaugural drill program.""*"|0.86|15|0|15

**OP:**

You might have already heard about BioLargo or seen my post “$168 BILLION Water Bill just Passed - BioLargo DD $BLGO - is Clean Water!! Clean Air, Cleaner Earth, and Much More.” on this board that got some attention. 

You certainly will have already seen or are going to see the TV commercial for their white label Pet Odor Elimination Product POOPH - that works magic and is just starting to take over the Amazon Best Seller lists and is becoming a Blockbuster Product. 

https://preview.redd.it/s3ef72phv8l91.png?width=2088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=115499dcd88aef6f87a056a28c48d587813f2572

I want to use the opportunity to share some more information as IMHO BioLargo is one of the best investing opportunities out there - the perfect combination - of investing in the “clean” future while going for the big bucks. 

Especially as the Clean Water Bill passed that guarantees $168 Billion for clean water and PFAS contamination is becoming the hot environmental topic.

And MOST IMPORTANTLY THE EPA IS DESIGNATING TWO PFAS AS HAZMAT WASTE. 

As of today, BioLargo’s AEC has the most effective and most efficient PFAS Cleaning tech out there. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is just a question of time (and Good News) until a big wave of new investors and money will come to join this Clean Water, Clean Air, Cleaner Earth (and wound care) investing opportunity.

The share price is very low as BioLargo paid off almost $7.6 Million in debt in the last years and some of the projects were delayed - but it is all happening now = we are already deep into the BLGO paradigm shift but the market has not yet reacted.

&amp;#x200B;

BioLargo just published a  New Quarterly Revenue Record - Quarterly Revenues in Q2 Grew 185% Compared to Q2 of 2021 and it is expected to be followed by higher numbers and growth in the following Qs.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8vh05k2sv8l91.png?width=686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44e7d43963a8fac67df64bbdca90a3e25ae5c348

The progress is accelerating: the partnerships/ two subsidiaries turned profitable/the California engineering office opened/

record growth/ record revenues/ amazing study results/ team-ups/first AEC Client and first AEC Channel Partner on board/ biggest contracts yet/ Moving to phase II of contracts with multiples in revenues soon/ AOS commercial units built/ promising acquisition happened/

AEC improved/ new patents filed/ trials at municipalities scheduled/ almost debt free / Asia joint venture showing First adaptions/ new studies released/ more studies coming/ prototype production systems for Nuclear fuel innovator/

cash flow positive on the horizon / giant waste to energy project started/ $500 Million plus project/ working on Lithium extraction/ 10 Billion Dollars for PFAS solutions from administration announced etc. etc..

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This clean tech / W2E/ wound care / minerals / water play seems to be the perfect place to be invested in.

Some might have bought in early But At around a $50 Million Market cap this makes for an incredible investing opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

A like-minded investor strongly believes In a bright future for $BLGO as well. I like his post “WHY BLGO MAY NOT REMAIN UNDERVALUED AND UNDISCOVERED MUCH LONGER” and also Pennyqueen’s “3 Products Behind The Rise of This Clean-Water Tech Co.”

She made Biolargo one of her top picks:

&gt;**“Every once in a great while, I find a company that is grossly undervalued, aligned with my principles, and has commercial-ready technology. BioLargo has passed my test with flying colors, and I truly believe we are witnessing the birth of a giant”** 

It is also good to know that investors close to the company just invested about a million dollars directly into the company.

BTW- don’t forget that the BLGO CFO decided to solely get paid in options that have an exercise price at .24 - above today’s levels.

 That means you can currently buy shares more than 20% cheaper than what the CFO will have to pay for his shares - as his SOLE payment.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

POOPH:

Pooph is becoming a blockbuster product.

Pooph is the Pet Odor eliminator that is based on BioLargo’s Cupridyne Clean Tech and brought to market by the marketing geniuses of Ikigai. 

They have been responsible for the marketing of brands like Febreze, Swiffer etc. 

POOPH is breaking all records. 

The commercial aired 2400 times in the past 30 days- and every American will learn about this amazing brand. 

It just Broke 2225 ratings on Amazon and the average rating is back above 4. (It works magic- but you have to hit the source of smell) 

AND IT IS THE NUMBER 1 selling DOG Deodorizer already!!

Sales almost doubled from May to June and almost doubled again from June to July and they are still growing fast. Note that In July alone the sales were almost as high as in the three previous months combined. 

&amp;#x200B;

The current run rate is already $26 million - that means if they will continue selling at today’s pay it would result in that amount of annual revenue-  and that is before it has hit big box retailers like Walmart (scheduled for Q4). 

https://preview.redd.it/243pavraw8l91.png?width=3048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2183d142f0d2b88e488d70ebfeaa278443bfc5e1

&amp;#x200B;

The whole purpose of the brand is to grow it fast (to around $100 million in revenue) and to sell it to a giant like P&amp;G They expect to be able to sell the brand at 3-7 times revenue. At the target revenue of $100 million /year that 3-7 X is expected to bring in a $300-700 Million brand sale price. BioLargo will get 20% of that exit. Hence we are talking about a fascinating $ 60-140 million cash infusion that will occur in the next few years. BioLargo is already breaking all revenue records and that is to be expected to continue. Until the brand sale, we will get a 6% licensing fee and a manufacturer's margin. 

Note: 

POOPH is on the market for 8 months and is breaking all records and outperforming all projections. Their current run rate already is at $26 Million- So very likely they will hit their targeted 100 million earlier than in their 4-year goal. Pooph will bring a lot more clients, attention, cash, and new investors to BioLargo.

&amp;#x200B;

From article:

\* BLGO share price of $.20 with a market cap of only $52 million. Several recent press releases point to an extraordinary sales potential suggesting it may not be long before investors discover BLGO and revalue the share price

BioLargo, Inc. (BLGO: OTCQB) has been slugging it out for over a decade to develop broad-reaching technologies to improve water and air quality. Based on a plethora of press releases and company communications through interviews, it appears that efforts are rapidly shifting from R&amp;D to commercialization that could generate unusually hefty revenues, especially if the company executes big licensing deals with major partners. The long wait appears to be quickly fading in the rear-view mirror, while the road just ahead is coming into clear focus as the shiny yellow brick road that management has been pursuing for a decade.

&amp;#x200B;

BioLargo shares may only trade at $.20 and support a very small market cap of about $53 million, but their products that are unrivaled in both cost and effectiveness are very close to starting what could be game-changing launches for several large industries. The needs for BioLargo’s products like the AOS and the AEC are so enormous that if the pilots/first installs are as successful as prior testing has demonstrated, the company revenues could surprise even the most optimistic forecasts.

&amp;#x200B;

Timing is always a major factor in any investment decision. BioLargo has earned a good hard look by investors as it appears the long wait is finally over. 

Investors are encouraged to pour through a rich offering of information about the company’s technologies, management, financials, products, and news which is available on their homepage and on many investor community platforms.

BioLargo’s President and CEO Dennis P. Calvert said, 

&gt;“We are proud of the entire BioLargo team working together and executing on all fronts as we continue growing the business through bigger and better projects. It has been incredible to watch our team land and expand into new client projects through great service and deliverables. PFAS is a major opportunity for us, and we are on the forefront of real environmental impact, working with channel partners to solve some of today’s toughest environmental challenges.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**BioLargo, Inc.** 

 invents, develops, and commercializes innovative technologies in the cleantech space, including for PFAS contamination, advanced water and wastewater treatment, industrial odor and VOC control, air quality control, and infection control. 

With over 13 years of extensive R&amp;D, BioLargo holds a wide array of issued patents, maintains a robust pipeline of products, and provides full-service environmental engineering. 

The approach is to invent or acquire novel technologies and develop them to maturity through the operating subsidiaries. They have developed a number of key channel partnerships to support the reach of their products and services and maximize their commercial potential. With a keen emphasis on collaborations with academic, municipal, and commercial organizations and associations, BioLargo has proven itself with over 90 awarded grants and numerous pilot projects. 

They monetize through direct sales,  recurring service contracts, licensing agreements, strategic joint venture formation and/or the sale of the IP.

**Financial highlights**

\* Company-wide consolidated revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, was $1,323,000 and $2,287,000, which is a 185% and 121% increase over the same periods in 2021; revenue this quarter was a 37% increase compared with the first quarter of 2022.

\* Revenues from ONM Environmental, the company’s odor and VOC control subsidiary, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, were $700,000 and $1,300,000, an increase of $344,000 and $658,000, from the same periods in 2021. In the second quarter of 2022, this subsidiary generated a net operating income of $11,000, compared to a net operating loss of $107,000 in the same period of 2021.

\* Revenues from third parties for BioLargo Engineering, Science &amp; Technologies, the company’s environmental engineering subsidiary, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, were $617,000 and $972,000, an increase of $434,000 and $698,000, from the same periods in 2021. In the second quarter of 2022, this subsidiary generated a net operating income of $56,000, compared to a net operating loss of $190,000 in the same period of 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Commercial and developmental highlights**

\* First PFAS customer – the company recently secured its first PFAS customer. As part of this project, BioLargo will engineer a comprehensive PFAS mitigation plan for an industrial site, and has signed an agreement with a new channel partner to sell the company’s PFAS treatment equipment and engineering services.

\* Ikigai’s POOPH – The company’s white-label pet odor control product partnership with Ikigai is advancing well and generating increasing revenues both from manufacturing the product and from license royalties. Sales thus far have exceeded early expectations, and the company’s partners at Ikigai are confident that growth will continue, especially as they push to get the product onto shelves at major retailers.

\* Garratt-Callahan partnership – The company expects first sales of the “minimal liquid discharge” (MLD) wastewater treatment equipment developed in partnership with Garratt-Callahan to begin soon, following discussions with an expanding list of Garratt-Callahan customers.

\* Larger engineering projects – In this quarter, BioLargo Engineering, Science &amp; Technologies executed engineering projects for new customers, including its project to develop prototypes with Ultra Safe Nuclear, and the waste-to-energy plant project in South America. With both of these projects, early phase work is nearly done, and management anticipates that additional phases will soon begin, with the scope of work and level of engagement expanding.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind that as of today BioLargo has the most effective and most efficient targeted PFAS collecting technology known - the AEC.

**AEC** 

BioLargo Aqueous Electrostatic Concentrator (AEC) is designed to provide rapid, effective, and affordable concentration of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in water. It works by separating PFAS compounds in an electrostatic field and forcing them through a proprietary membrane system.

The result – the AEC removes &gt;99% PFAS from water in continuous flow, at energy costs as low as 30 cents per 1,000 gallons.

Advantages over other technologies:

▪ More energy-efficient

▪ More affordable on per-gallon basis

▪ Much less PFAS-laden waste produced

▪ Less activated carbon required in PFAS life cycle

▪ Higher purity of final water

▪ Compact; small footprint

Development and commercialization of the AEC is supported in part by a grant provided by the US EPA SBIR.

https://preview.redd.it/nw501i2pv8l91.png?width=1416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2421652477fd16ec78761ce2dc2162a019bf0708

&amp;#x200B;

While many new PFAS destruction approaches recently made headlines. They all would require some sort of concentration /filtering to make more sense. They actually could become really powerful when used in combination with the AEC.

That is the beauty of the concept - take the PFAS out for the cheapest best way possible and then destruct them the best way that will be available at each point in time.

Carbon filtration causes 1000 times more PFAS laden waste than the AEC. That the EPA now has classified as Hazardous substances. 

A HUGE step forward to bringing the AEC to the center of attention.

&amp;#x200B;

With BioLargo’s AEC technology, “at the end of a treatment cycle, instead of having 80,000 pounds of waste, we might have 85 pounds,” says Moore. BioLargo is also working on a sustainable way of extracting PFAS from the spent membrane, destroying the PFAS, and sending the membrane residue to a landfill.

Imho this is THE  game-changer for BioLargo. Projects are estimated to have a volume between 500k - 30 Million. 

They just improved the technology, filed another patent,

and also signed the first contract for a BIG PFAS remediation project. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first big AEC channel partner is also on board that is preparing the national launch of the AEC technology in a certain sector, and regulatory is playing into our hands as well. All while we will face record growth and record revenues for many Qs to come through other engineering projects and Pooph that is getting more and more sales and attention.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you would hear about a company that has solutions for two of the massive global water problems and for now they have the most effective and efficient solution for that $80 Billion/year PFAS cleanup and the entire company is worth just around $50 Million- what would you think?

Right, It would sound too good to be true.

But folks it is not. We have been following BioLargo closely and what they set out to do is actually happening (with some delays).

It is the perfect time to discover this as they will keep breaking revenue records and they are destined to become a Global Clean Tech Powerhouse. 

Do your own DD and invest accordingly!

About the OP:

I am a purpose-driven investor that has made amazing returns on my Exact Sciences investment -my core position was up between 1600% and 2650 %. when I placed it into BioLargo - where I expect even higher returns.

For many years I was sharing all the info I could find about EXAS and paired it with my thoughts on the Yahoo message board. 

I promised myself that whenever I’ll feel 100% confident again that I found a ""guaranteed"" multi-bagger - I will bet the farm. 

I am very happy that I was able to accumulate almost 1% ownership of Biolargo over the past few years.

I attended the last 5 BLGO shareholder meetings, do almost daily DD, had conversations with all the key management people, and did a few 1000 posts on various message boards. I am constantly reassessing my Biolargo investing strategy- so my DD is mainly for myself but might give interesting information to others as well. 

I am not a financial advisor, this post is made for educational purposes only. Literally. Don’t take my word for anything that is presented in this post, do your own research, and invest solely based on the thesis that you create for yourself. Don’t get influenced by anyone.

I honestly believe there is no better way to place the money than putting it into a purposeful company that will have a positive impact on the world, will „Make Life Better“, and also looks like a certain multi-bagger.

IMHO BioLargo is one of the best investing opportunities out there - the perfect combination - investing in the “clean” future while going for the big bucks.

Global Warming Solutions $GWSO has been on an absolute tear these past few months— just look at its performance since July— This stock is far from finished with a HUGE catalyst in September.  Funny thing is, nobody is paying attention about this company… it’s not everyday you stumble on the pot of gold on the other side of the rainbow. 

Let me break it down: 
The industry- Bullish af, the world we live in today is all about Corporate Social Responsibility, CSR. You’re looking at a company who is doing just that— it’s literally in the fucking name… Combatting global warming and the issues of climate change is one of the most talked about topics in politics and society. The amount of money that is currently flowing in and that will continue to flow will only increase. TLDR: Money flowing in to solve global environmental issues will only increase. The company not only is positioned perfectly to benefit from the inflow but also by having CSR as a core mission. 

The catalyst- In September they are launching a Sodium EV battery, that will COMPLETELY transform this company. This battery is more eco friendly, cheaper to make, last just as long and can be a prominent player in the electric vehicle battery industry….
Once this battery is a success can you even imagine the type of contracts this company can receive!!?? This will 10x their revenue at least. We are looking at potential big automaker, airline and scooter contracts. Again nobody knows this is happening… the potential here is 5x at least 

Promotion- Look at one of their latest press releases they are talking about ramping up marketing efforts to gain more exposure. And today Floyd Mayweather shouted them out on Instagram. I think they are far from done and will have more endorsements coming out to prepare for their investor day. 

TLDR: nobody knows about this company with an insane catalyst coming out next month that can change this companies future… The upside potential is insane!!"|0.6|1|0|1

8 cents profit in only HALF a year and a stock price of 40 cents. That's real earnings as they make the cashflow. $12 operational expense and more drilling in MDA. The RiggerTalk website confirms that they are drilling. Lots of drilling plans mentioned in the MDA and this video. Management is keeping its word with past drilling, good to see that.

I found it with APRN (still in it heavy, btw, and yes it IS possible to have more than a single position at once) and I’m hoping I’ve found another here. What’s the linchpin this time? Another ***activist investor***. I love that type of investor, because they provide some insulation from the broader markets.

Anyways, on to the topic at hand… Avaya (AVYA). It has a number of things going for it (outlined below), but it all centers around the activist investor: Theodore (“Theo”) King.. Theo is goated btw this year alone he played AAMC (pos +36% now), FEDU (pos +34% now), TEDU (pos +362%!) all while the market dead, and now he has moved onto AVYA – writing out his [lizard brained thesis](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm) for all to see. I suggest you read the document, as while I cite a lot of it, there’s no substitute for going to the source.

**Anyway, AVYA is valued at the depth of the earth’s core but there are some dynamics that make it attractive**. The fundamentals aren’t shitco but more interesting is finding an opportunity for **basis risk blowout that can lead to outsized upward movement**. Standby smooth brains, we’re going on a journey….

# The Slide

**Briefly: Avaya is a big tech company with 90,000 customers in 190 companies with thousands of patents (over 4000). Its primary business is a product called OneCloud which is a** unified communications and collaboration software.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h3txlqddn3l91.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec0947a4995b89193715428fab1b0d768f2fdc24

**Over the past year** ***former*** **CEO Jim Chirico**  took a $2B company down to $100m in a year with decreasing revenue and frankly a real risk of bankruptcy.  The stock has fallen 94% YTD. Irresponsible really.

Inept ol’ Jimmy boy shows up to his performance review (7/29) all wide eye’d and shit coked out of his mind unable to explain the discrepancy in Q3 earnings. **The Board fires him and plugs in Alan Masarek**. More on Masarek shortly.

The market panics, creditors are pissed, CEO is getting canned, and 10-Q is delayed. So price drops from $2 to $0.60 within a week. **AVYA is left for dead and consensus is bankruptcy.** Hang in there little guy, we’re getting to the good stuff.

# Inflection

Avaya OneCloud is growing at 21% QoQ and 118% YoY (per Q2 ER). **OneCloud is the AVYA engine and currently generates $750M in Annual Recurring Revenue**; estimated to reach $1B ARR end of 2022. AVYA has 90,000 customers and acquiring customers in enterprise software is expensive AF so they’re not evaporating overnight.

They had roughly $325mm in cash on the balance sheet. They just raised $650mm in recent financing, subtract paying off the $350mm for 2023 notes, nets $300mm cash. **Drawing down the remaining $118mm ABL facility (as suggested by Theo) would boost total liquidity to $743mm in cash ($325+$300+118). AVYA has sufficient liquidity and options to implement the necessary turnaround.**

For capital structuring, Masarek already has experience with Vonage. In fact, He was able to produce an incremental $200mm cash flow per year for Vonage. **For Avaya, he is working to reach resolution to close out the 2023 notes with cash in escrow from the 2027 notes**. Which should be soon because AVYA released the prelim 10Q to private investors last week and, interestingly, bonds rallied.

**Operationally, Masarak has committed to a quick transition from traditional offering to SaaS**. This includes plans to ensure a transition to recurring revenue such that AVYA is cash flow positive before end of year. Moreover, he’s openly announced he’s going to cut the fat and right size workforce to focus on the greatest return.

**If anything, AVYA sets up for a nice acquisition target**. The AVYA brand name and customer base is worth way more than the company itself at $100mm market cap. **I mean think about it, at a market cap of \~$100mm, AVYA generates 2x its market cap in EBITDA per year**.

# Theo the Chad

**Theodore King (@dkl1897 in the pics btw) began by co-founding the SaaS company, Faria Education Group**, while at Wharton in San Fran. Consider that while the rest of you puked into fraternity bushes and literally worked at Wendy’s through college. Today, this same company serves 4.3mm students in 140 countries with 45% CAGR in sales. Needless to say, this dude knows SaaS and has the bags to prove it.

**Theo is an activist investor and just raised his stake to 15.4%in AVYA as of 8/19/22**. Funny enough he recently increased his stake by fucking around with MMs selling near dated $2, $2.5, and $3 strike puts. As with all his investments, he has a long term thesis greater than 24 months **and has no plans to sell.**

Like a true chad, **Theo filed his latest 13G with his** [**lizard brained thesis**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm) where he lays out personal experience, capital restructuring opportunities, and the digital transformation. He’s active on twitter where he loves to call it like it is; scope hovering on debt holders and MMs.

Think we could all take a page out of his book when you look at his port. The man apes into the dip on all of his plays with precision and just keeps winning. Here's a decent trader/investor talking about looking for opportunities when others run for the hills.

# Basis Risk Blowout

Now’s the time to chat basis risk. **Basis risk arises when a hedge imperfectly offsets the core position**. It comes in a couple flavors of… price, quality, timing, etc. Just read on and you’ll get it. Firms hedge essentially, to remove exposure to movements of the underlying stock until delivery. Let me explain…

Say my old crotchety aunt is gifting me 100 shares of GME when she dies in precisely 1 month. The old hag won’t let me have them any sooner under “any fucking circumstance”. But whatever, I sell a naked October call on GME today.

The position approximates a covered call, right, because I’ll have the shares in 1 month anyways. However, it entails timing basis risk because I don’t actually have the shares (collateral) immediately on hand and won’t for another month. **The** **basis** **that I can cover my call immediately is at** **risk** **due to the** **timing** **of when the collateral will be delivered.**

Unexpectedly, GME rockets to the moon when apes pump it from $35 to $400 and my naked call is waaay ITM. My broker margin calls me but my crypt keeper aunt tells me to pound sand. This means, I’ll have to satisfy the margin call *today* by purchasing directly on the market at $400! **Even though the collateral will be in my account in 1 month, I’m squeezed immediately because the shares have another month to be forked over**. Alright so you have a flavor for basis risk. We’ll circle back on why that matters for AVYA shortly.

AVYA closed financing on $250mm ‘27 convertible notes on 7/12/22. This financing was part of an effort to pay off the $350mm Dec 2023 notes set to expire. The conversion rate for the ‘27 notes is based on the following table taken from the Indenture:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vdljusdrn3l91.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f65ee63891b5d1c00ba49b0a1be0722ae376cbd

Note the floor of $3.42 for current year and underlying price. The table reflects the *additional* share conversion from the baseline 232.5581 per $1000 debt. So at $3.42 (or below) today the conversion is 292.3976. **The math here is not as important as the $3.42 price floor, remember that.**

Generally, it’s common for convertible debt holders to enter a “convertible hedge” to reduce default risk and increase yield. **A convertible hedge is a strategy where an investor buys a convertible bond and then shorts the stock to increase the overall yield**.

To avoid price risk, debt holders would short the stock for a hedge around $3.42. Interestingly, at the same time **AVYA opened financing on these exact 2027 notes… shorts spiked from 7.9mm to 12.2mm 🤔.** This is not a coincidence.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/on9us1rsn3l91.jpg?width=283&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22e9e8cbcc6f9a1e716ade26ba0bd7bd1d02e0c6

Clearly 2027 debt holders are shorts on the other end, hedging their position by incrementally increasing shorts. In fact, Ortex estimates 100% utilization and 17.13mm shorts currently.

On the topic of float, AVYA has 85.84 mm shares outstanding ([10Q](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000141810022000047/avya-20220331.htm)) but I combed through some filings to determine float. I’ll go through the math more meticulously in a separate post but determined that **the effective float is somewhere around 20 mm \[86 - 44.5 - 20 - 1.5 = 20\].** If the price rises above $7 the float would be more like 20 - 39mm since weaker hands rise above their cost basis.

**Based on float of 20mm, the SI is somewhere between 76% (FINRA) and 86% (Ortex). More importantly, the debt holder conversion (collateral) is locked until October 1st, 2022 per the Note Indenture.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Bloomberg terminal AVYA 2027 notes](https://preview.redd.it/bff4uxnun3l91.png?width=404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4ceec790fd1354345381cbd2c5acb12376bf8bd)

&amp;#x200B;

So if the price of AVYA were to move substantially above the convertible hedge cost basis (theoretically near $3.42), the note holders could be margin called or panic cover to reduce exposure.

&amp;#x200B;

[Theo’s letter to the SEC when filing 13G\/A](https://preview.redd.it/bfock1cxn3l91.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e2eeddad0c3d461ec907c706fe6ae7ddce84bbc)

**Pulling it together, convertible hedges near $3.42 cannot be covered if shorts are margin called before October 1st due to the inability to exercise the conversion.** Between now and then, they carry time basis risk. Aunty is a ruthless bitch and debt holders are about to be working behind a Wendy’s. **This is what I mean by basis risk blowout!**

# Liquidity in Distress

Last two weeks, AVYA has traded abnormally. The kinds of things you see when fuckery is afoot. There have been periods of price barcoding indicating price exploration and frantic searches for book liquidity. There’s also been an extreme rise in short exempt volume.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/77bymm91o3l91.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c2f431d9348b7486abe360509e7ab870adec63

(Short exempt spiking with accelerating price action)

The short exempt volume reached approximately 10% of the free float. This extremely high SE number is a red flashing light on synthetic short positions and market making. Hell, even our boy Theo calling out the oddities:

&amp;#x200B;

[Theo’s letter to SEC when filing 13G\/A](https://preview.redd.it/7fdatzi3o3l91.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d00b8165e2a3165758eabea41368a37846dc4ff1)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Theo tweet 8\/23\/22](https://preview.redd.it/aw9rekf5o3l91.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09f84a52dcdba12d85535b29ee331a6d655b7acb)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On 8/29, AVYA was added to the NYSE Reg SHO Threshold List. As a reminder, a security hits the reg threshold list when there are accumulating failures to deliver and marketing making instabilities. Essentially, it flags when there is liquidity distress in trading of a security. If debt holders are forced to shed hedges, then buying on the open market before October 1st will be extremely crowded.

# Resistance &amp; Retribution

In his letter to the SEC, **Theo compares the AVYA to CDC Corp in December 2011**. At the time, CDC was hammered on a failed spinoff that was meant to pay off debt coming due (much like AVYA ‘23 notes). However, the market panicked and devalued the business despite strong fundamentals. **The CDC sell off was eclipsed by 5,000% returns over 2 months when Vista PE initiated an acquisition**. While markets are reactionary, emotional, and irrational, Theo is not. The man just descended from heaven and gifted us alpha.

I’m not suggesting that AVYA goes immediately to 5,000% but there are some reasonable key price levels in both the near term (1 month) and mid term horizons (12 months). First, we have initial confirmation over $1 for solid support. Next key levels are roughly $2.5, $4.5, $12, and $18: provided sufficient capital inflows:

&amp;#x200B;

[AVYA daily candles - Oct ‘21 to Aug ‘22](https://preview.redd.it/wbq9gi48o3l91.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeddb06a40b724af8852ccf3fc5274f8a144f578)

**Most immediately there is a gap fill to $2 - $2.5 resistance**. With large gamma positioning within $2 to $3 (both calls and puts) this resistance intuitively checks out. **Right now AVYA is consolidating at $1.25-$1.5 on tapering volume; preparing for a massive leg up.**

**In addition, you see the massive OI on the $c 9/16? I dug into those transactions and verified they were large BTO orders.** Not a huge gamma effect right now but my homies Black and Scholes estimate the gamma should start to hit the gas pedal **above $2.5 which will cause an exponential gamma effect** as price continues to rise above $2.5 and higher and higher.

The $4 - $8 region should further setup nicely. Remember that $3.42 is the threshold for the convertible notes and short hedges are likely at this price level. **At a 100% margin requirement, margin calls should hit at \~$7 if shorts don’t preemptively cover sooner.**. Otherwise, not overly concerned with weak, choppy resistance around $3.5 - $5.5.

Ultimately think there’s enough juice to hit the $12 - $14 resistance but pretty shaky any higher at this point. The fuel to get there is multi-fold as mentioned.

# TL;DR

Market has priced AVYA for bankruptcy based on several items that could rapidly unwind within the coming days/weeks. This is alongside basis risk blowout from convertible short hedges near $3.42 that cannot be covered until October 1st. Any of these items could result in large upside:

1. Filing of the 10Q and any not so shitty corrections
2. Filing of Form 4 share purchased by Masarek following the 10Q
3. Additional purchasing by Theo (activist investor)
4. Resolution of the ‘23 note buyback with cash in escrow
5. Basic risk blowout from preemptive convertible hedge prior to October 1st
6. Large gamma effects from $8c ~~8/19~~ Sept Mopex if price rises to and above the $2.5 level

While a lot of companies priced for bankruptcy are shitcos, AVYA has an extensive customer base and reputable product OneCloud. Critical steps are simply to transition to subscription based model and ensure capital structure is resolved and optimized. In addition, AVYA has a lot of liquidity within grasp ($743mm).

They started with paying out tips in the hospitality industry. interesting to me was they were also paying wages to some to pizza delivery drivers. This is why I invested. If you can pay a pizza delivery driver the same day he worked you can pay a truck driver the same way. 

Being a truck driver I know what potential this has in my industry. I would say currently but even before the rest of the industries were having problems finding employees the trucking industry was already there. If a truck has the potential to be paid at the end of his shift for a company driver or when load is completed for owner operators; well frankly that is a game changer. Not only will guys pick up extra shifts, they will go to the place where they can paid immediately.

Do to current market conditions I believe this stock is at a deep discount. I encourage you to take some to do some DD on it. Get in early."|0.75|2|0|2

I will be adding more improvements to future posts. Feel free to reply or send a DM with suggestions.

Here are the filtering criteria and additional context on the analysis:

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Direct Open Market Transactions** (Transaction Code of “P” or ”S”) for Form 4 filings with a Transaction Date from **August 22nd - August 26th.** This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line. General consensus is that these transactions have more predictive power than those for RSUs, stock options, warrants etc.
2. Weekly comps are compared to transactions from **August 15th - August 19th**. So we are comparing the last full week of transactions to the prior full week of transactions.
3. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income funds).

# Layout

1. There are two time horizons, **(1) Snapshot** and **(2) Trend Analysis**. The former aggregates all dates while the latter is broken out by Transaction Date.
2. **As of now there are 6 sections:**
   1. Open Market Transaction Counts (Snapshot/Trend)
   2. Dollar Value of Open Market Transactions (Snapshot/Trend)
   3. Top 10 Transactions by Category
      1. Total Purchases (aggregated)
      2. Percent Increase in Shares Owned (individual transaction)
      3. CEO Purchases (aggregated)
      4. CFO Purchases (aggregated)
      5. 10% Owner Purchases (aggregated)
   4. Company-Level Open Market Activity (Snapshot/Trend)
   5. Insider-Level Open Market Activity (Snapshot/Trend)
   6. Sector-Level Activity
3. Sector-Level Activity contains four sub-sections:
   1. Purchases/Sales (Dollar-value of Transactions)
   2. Number of Insiders Buying/Selling
   3. Purchases/Sales (Transaction counts)
   4. Purchases/Sales ***for C-Suite only***

# Further Context

1. The transaction count/spend for more recent Transaction Dates at times (varies by week) will appear to taper off. This is partly due to a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transaction data. The delay between Filing Date and Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. Banned tickers also impact the N-size though it should generally have a more distributed impact than backfilled transactions.
2. To combat backfill, filings from this past Monday and Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced from[ Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

# Why is this worth looking at?

As with any dataset, when viewed in isolation this is not going to move the needle. **This is not a silver bullet.**

However I am of the opinion that an appreciation for what insiders (individual + in aggregate) are betting on (or not) is worth being aware of. At least a subset **\*should\*** have a 30,000 foot view of their company, competitors, their sector and the direction that it is headed. In the data lies clues.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 30, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Permex Petroleum Corporation (CSE: OIL) (OTCQB: OILCF) (FSE: 75P) (“Permex” or the “Company”), a junior oil and gas company, is pleased to announce results obtained from five recently recompleted oil and gas wells located in Eddy County, New Mexico and Martin County, Texas.  


In August, Permex continued its re-entry and stimulation program on its Henshaw Premier Unit and Oxy Yates properties situated in Eddy County New Mexico. The re-entry and stimulations involved targeting the Grayburg formation in the Henshaw well numbers 107, 2L, 3B, while targeting the Yates formation in Oxy yates 14-3 well. The Company also recompleted the Mabee Breedlove Clearfork Unit #12 (“MBCU”) on its Breedlove field within the Clearfork formation located in Martin County.

The recompletions were successful and came online at a combined initial production rate of 50 barrels of oil equivalent per day (“BOEPD”) and have stabilized at a rate of 35 barrels of oil equivalent per day, increasing the Company’s total production to 71 barrels of oil equivalent per day (“BOEPD”). The Company has an additional 62 shut-in oil, gas and salt water disposal wells remaining to be brought online. Management believes these wells will have the potential to yield similar results, increasing the Company’s total daily production solely by re-entering shut-in wells.

ADVERTISEMENT

In addition to the re-entry and stimulation of the wells, management has started its extensive Enhanced Oil Recovery (“EOR”) study on the Clearfork formation for its Martin County asset. This includes review of all injection wells, downhole pressure and communication between injectors and receiving wells. Management expects to have the study published within 30 days and incorporate the findings for enhanced oil recovery.

“The results obtained through the minor stimulation and treatment of the recent wells are inline with our strategy to add sustainable marginal production through low risk, low cost recompletions while preparing for drilling programs for continued growth. We have now increased our production by as much as 48% compared to the June 30th, 2022 quarterly filings. Our plan has always been to take a methodical approach to our operations, and we believe we are setting realistic operational goals and are meeting our targets”, said Mehran Ehsan, President and CEO of Permex."|1.0|2|0|2

 July looks like it was very strong, 970K visitors vs their best of 971 in June. I'm not sure if we'll see a bit of a pullback for the rest of the year as they reduce spend. As Shift was growth focused, they succeeded on that and grew rapidly (more than tripling revenue in 2021 vs 2020). In the last couple quarters they've spoken about the shift to focusing on profitability and personally I think they are now going to execute on this new focus.

Not to rub folks noses in it, but think folks may be interested in what it seems to be final completion of what, in my opinion, is the most interesting single penny stock ever discussed on this board. For those who have been around the last 2 years or so I am sure this play will sound familiar. For those who don't know here is just a bit of what I remember of the top of my head...

\-Several years ago a company in Germany was offering a 10x return at that time SP on behalf of some client if one could tender 1 million share blocks of Petroteq for some 3rd party who wanted to buy out the company and was trying to acquire shares on the open market to get majority vote.

\-No one could really answer WHY they were trying to buy out some small market cap penny stock on the open market instead of just going straight to the board like EVERYONE else in EVERY other business M+A and making an offer. You would think 10x return is one that would force a shareholder vote at a minimum!

\-Folks jumped on the possibility and the stock price exploded.

\-Somewhere in there being a Canadian domiciled company it was suspended for trading on its native stock market due to some delayed accounting.

\-The company then hired Haywood Securities (why them I have know clue as they just do newsletters for oil/ gas plays and not M+A evaluations) to see if there were any other buyers.

\-After not finding any other buyers the board announced they agreed to the buyers and recommended the shareholders to tender for a buyout.

\-Buyout was delayed several times in the process.

\-Somewhere in there they finally had their accounting/ financial in order and resumed trading in Canada.

\-Finally a couple of days ago they did not get some certification done that was a stipulation as part of the deal for Viston who was either the final buyer or representing the final buyer pulled the deal.

\-Share price tumbled to near the start of this whole process.

I have nothing to really add, but did and do find this play the most fascinating single play in Penny stocks post COVID. Just thought some of the veteran folks may want to know how it all played out (at least for now)??"|0.85|9|0|9

 I’ve been doing some research this week and I discovered a few companies that use natural alternatives to medicine to treat issues such as chronic diseases. One in particular, Plantable Health (NEO: PLBL) (OTC: PLBLF), focuses on long-term dietary change, as our addiction to added sugar and highly-processed ingredients causes chronic diseases through inflammation and obesity. Currently, Plantable’s main source of revenue is through selling its “Reboot Program” through B2C. The Reboot is a 28 day program that combines meals, one-on-one coaching and all the lifestyle tools needed to reset habits. 

The real opportunity is with its phase II clinical trials that are currently underway at leading U.S. hospitals, as the successful conclusion of these trials will prove the efficacy of Plantable as a prescribable solution for doctors which is huge! And Plantable is currently working on building relationships with insurance companies with the goal to develop co-branded programs to support doctors with the patient’s overall treatment, and we will see collaboration with insurance companies begin once clinical trials enter phase III.

Plantable still has a lot of work to do, but they seem to have the plan laid out and are already acting on it, AND they are positioned well for reimbursement with the exploding cost of chronic disease management. This makes them a long-term player in the industry.

Management clearly has deep government connections.  RCAT is one of 5 drones approved by the military and a leader in multi-drone systems and operations.  

On the military/government front, RCAT has deep ties and has been awarded several contracts over the last couple of years related to surveillance and reconnaissance.  Contracts have come from NASA and DoD, among positive developments with other agencies.

On enterprise, RCAT recently completed a large surveillance project for General Motors covering 19 facilities, and a similar project for a client in Italy.  

On consumer, RCAT continues to sell to everyday people, but management does not appear to be focused on that as much. 

Insiders are also buying/exercising shares.  In the last two years, the CEO, CFO, COO, and several directors have purchased shares/exercised options.  In the last 6 months, 310k shares have been purchased with ZERO sold.  Around 1/3 of shares are currently held by insiders.

RCAT ALSO HAS MINIMAL DEBT.  On its recent 10k, RCAT reported $1.8 million in debt and $4 million in cash.  Current debt to equity ratio is 0.03x, and debt to assets is 0.02x.  ""RCAT has been less aggressive with using debt to finance growth than 88% of its peers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.""   

Recent and upcoming catalysts/events:

* In August 2022, RCAT received a waiver by the FAA (one of the first to be given) to allow a single pilot to control multiple drones for a public flight demonstration.  Previous waivers were given only for fireworks and similar events, and not for general public use in everyday life.  RCAT will hold a public demonstration on October 25
* In August 2022, RCAT recently demonstrated multi-drone mapping to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command.  This includes ""farsight"" mapping provides instant and ongoing 360-degree surveillance. Farsight gives military teams real-time access to detailed 3D maps of a target area.
* In May 2022, RCAT completed the development and production of a four-drone, multi-vehicle system for defense, government, and public safety markets. 
*  In May 2022, RCAT completed a two-year program with General Motors using the Skycopter™ to perform crane rail inspections in all 19 of its North American metalworking facilities. 
* In April 2022, RCAT secured an order for 15 Golden Eagle drone units, plus spares and training, from a NATO member country that has committed to deploy them in the Ukraine. 
* In March 2022, RCAT was selected by the DoD's Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and U.S. Army to compete in the Short Range Reconnaissance Tranche 2 (SRR T2) Program of Record.  Following a successful demonstration in September 2021, Teal was notified by the U.S. Army's Short Range Reconnaissance Product Office that it would advance to the prototype phase of the SRR T2 program and was awarded a $1.5M prototype contract. 
* In December 2021, RCAT was one of 5 companies awarded a US Customs and Border Protection contract worth up to $90 million over 5 years. 
*  In September 2021, RCAT was awarded a five-year contract with NASA to provide drone and rover software, hardware and support for NASA’s Simulated Mars mission.

UEC has been one of my favorite stocks all year and now I'm more interested in holding it for long term than swing trading. They recently acquired UEX which now makes them the largest NA uranium company.

[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uranium-energy-corp-completes-acquisition-of-uex-corporation-to-create-the-largest-diversified-north-american-focused-uranium-company-301609674.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uranium-energy-corp-completes-acquisition-of-uex-corporation-to-create-the-largest-diversified-north-american-focused-uranium-company-301609674.html)

There are still 4 analysts covering this stock in the last 3 months, with the average price target being over $6.

[https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/uec/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/uec/forecast)

On the financial side, UEC according to their latest 10-Q report, had almost 10m in revenue with a gross profit of 3.3m and no debt. They also have 23m in cash and another over 50m in inventory value.  This doesn't include their recent acquisition, so these numbers won't be entirely accurate until their next quarterly report. With the cost of uranium still near all time highs and increasing by almost double in the last year alone, their inventory will hopefully continue to increase in value.

This project is receiving $50 million in funding from Woodside who is an Australian power company along with $38 million from a US government grant.

A lot of people are against concentrated solar because of the Ivanpath facility in Nevada. What people don’t get is the first year it was operational it only produced 40% of the energy projected but they eventually got that up to 97%.

Heliogen will produce at a fraction of the cost of anything done before. This is because they are doing a module design that is installed by an AI robot and cleaned by the same robot. Most concentrated solar facilities have been built site-specific and use huge expensive mirrors. They haven’t been businesses but more projects. Heliogen is establishing itself as a business that can do thousands of projects.

They also use highly advanced AI to track and position the mirrors. Because of this they don’t really have to do groundwork to prep a site for installation. That also saves huge amounts of costs.

At a $423M market cap it has so much room to grow. Could easily se wit going to $10B. Right now only $2.23 a share. If it goes to $10B market cap that will be around $50 a share.

t3_x1atk0|1661837717|pennystocks|$APRN DD - Probable Buyback In September. Posted This in ShortSqueeze|"There is loads more DD in my post history, coupled with great DD from users NebulaPlauge and CBarkleysGolfSwing. Also on the APRNstock subreddit. If you go into my post history, I'd start with the T-10 Days! DD to get a full picture of what's happening. 

Yesterday user brownqk asked if I could elaborate on which choice would be more likely: a tender offer, or an open market buyback. And many users have said not to ""trust insiders"" and that Sanberg will pull the rug on retail. So today we're going to look in depth at both of these things and build off the beautiful DD done by CBarkleysGolfSwing over on the APRNstock subreddit. If you stumble on this and wonder what the countdown is towards, I'd recommend reviewing my post history, CBarkleysGolfSwing's account, or NebulaPlauge's account.

The who, what, and why for buybacks occuring?

**Who**: Step one of a buyback is that the board of directors (remember this for later) has to pass a ""repurchase authorization"" at which point a public announcement details how much money will be allocated to buy back shares—or alternatively the number of shares or percentage of shares outstanding it aims to buy back.

**What**: What is a buyback? Well it's when a company has liquid capital and they choose to buy their own shares off the open market, or they have shareholders submit a tender offer for the quantity of shares they want back and the price they're willing to sell them back at. Then the company chooses a blend of the tender offers to get the best price. Here's investopedia's definitions of the two choices:

1. The company shareholders receive a tender offer that requests them to submit, or tender, a portion or all of their shares within a certain time frame. The offer will state the number of shares the company wants to repurchase and a price range for the shares.﻿ Investors who accept the offer will state how many shares they want to tender along with the price they are willing to accept. Once the company has received all of the offers, it will find the right mix to buy the shares at the lowest cost.
2. A company can also buy its shares on the open market at the market price. It is often the case, however, that the announcement of a buyback causes the share price to shoot up because the market perceives it as a positive signal.

**Why**: Buybacks occur for three primary reasons:

1. Ownership Consolidation
2. Undervaluation
3. Boosting key financial ratios

In this instance we actually have been told by APRN in their SEC filing and their investors presentation that it's due to #2 and that this will help with ""enhancing shareholder value"" (see the last sentence directly from their filing in the picture below) - but a secondary benefit for Sanberg is that it will also consolidate his ownership.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hqvwplcqesk91.png?width=1632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c51caca488fcd4860fb875b1fe767cce2da965b6

Because the language chosen was ""enhance shareholder value"" and one of the primary reasons is undervaluation (Sanberg has often commented that ""perhaps others don't see the value that he sees"" in APRN and has hinted to taking it private) I believe this is an indicator that buying at Market Price is going to be the chosen route. The common stock is already heavily shorted and currently inexpensive to buyback. I believe a tender offer would be time consuming, allow hedging, and would be less efficient at accomplishing their mission. This money *should* be available on August 31st based on SEC filings; however, renegotiation can always occur if both parties choose to do so, but I see no reason why the original agreement wouldn't be honored and exercised that day (thus my countdown).

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

So is Joseph Sanburg a rug puller and an untrustworthy insider? (Hint, the answer is no)

Aside from the SEC not allowing him to make a profit on the sale of these new shares for sixth months due to the short swing profit rule, he'd also be losing his &gt;50% stake in the company.

But wait, there's actually millions of reasons why he won't ""rug pull"" like a lot of FUD commenters are saying he will after the Ryan Cohen BBBY debacle. What are they? Rolling Warrants.

Here's the rolling warrants verbiage in APRN's SEC filing regarding RJB partners:

&gt;Warrants to purchase 2,400,000 shares of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $15.00 per share, (iii) warrants to purchase 1,200,000 shares of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $18.00 per share, and (iv) warrants to purchase 600,000 shares of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $20.00 per share

So this begs the question: how many shares does Sanberg CURRENTLY own? Insider ownership has been pretty murky and it's been tough to nail down how large the float is because all of this is taking place this month. CBarkleysGolfSwing did an excellent job showing Sanberg's current ownership:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sucmg911fsk91.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eabc87da409fefd51bd101b8aa35514ab9185ac4

That $7.61 average is another reason he won't pull the rug. Also, the amended filing increasing his ownership was still paid at a PREMIUM in comparison to the stock price on August 8th, which was trading around $3.50. He clearly has a plan and is all in on this company long term.

There's also only one place I've found that is even remotely close to the accurate amount of shares Sanberg currently owns after this filing and that's wallstreetzen that has him listed at 18,602,135. Since they're the closest to accurate that I've found, I looked at their current Insider Ownership totals:

NameHoldSharesJoseph Sanberg41.53%18,602,135First Round Capital15.7%7,034,245Barry Salzberg4.21%1,884,721Matthew Salzberg4.09%1,833,581DPH Holdings4.09%1,830,535Brad Dickerson0.58%261,032Linda Findley0.43%194,620Linda Kozlowski0.31%138,768**Total70.94%31,779,637**

You might be going onto yahoo finance and noticing that the Hold percentage doesn't seem accurate since the total shares is so close to the shares outstanding. That's because it's missing the 10,000,000 shares that are being **issued** to Sanberg on this new PIPE (private investment in public equity).

Now these numbers do not include the buyback, nor do they include institutional ownership (wallstreetzed has that around 9,408,179, or 21%). That gives us a grand total of 41,187,816 shares. Out of a total of 44,759,727 outstanding shares (92%), so an estimated float of 3,583,658. This is why I think the float is significantly smaller than what is currently being listed, but I can't seem to pin down 100% accurate numbers from any website. For what it's worth, Fintel has institutional ownership listed at 11,293,317, which is obviously even higher.

This is why Sanberg is absolutely not a rug puller. His rolling warrants (expiration in 7 years) means he believes the lowest evaluation of the company should be $20/share and that's when he'll hit his 27,623,755 total share count with 51.33% ownership according to the SEC 13D/A Filing.

Finally, here's another snip from that same filing:

&gt;In addition, pursuant to the April Purchase Agreement Amendment, effectively immediately following, and contingent upon, the closing of the acquisition of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the April Purchase Agreement Amendment and until the expiration of the standstill period in the September Purchase Agreement, Mr. Sanberg will be entitled to appoint one individual, which will be **Alex Chalunkal, Mr. Sanberg’s Chief Investment Officer, to serve as a member of the board of directors of the Company**. The Company shall cause such individual to be included in its proxy statement as a nominee for election for each annual meeting that occurs prior to the expiration of such standstill period. As a result, effective immediately following, and contingent upon, such closing, Alex Chalunkal will be appointed to serve as Class III director on the board of directors of the Company.

And another:

&gt;Voting and dispositive power of the shares and warrants, as applicable, held by RJB Partners, Long Live Bruce and AGO II are deemed shared with Mr. Sanberg as the managing member thereof.  
(c) Except as set forth in Item 4 above, none of the Reporting Persons has effected any transactions in the shares of Class A Common Stock in the past 60 days.

This tells us that Sanberg is most likely leaving his Chief Investment Officer on the board to execute the buyback strategy. And the second quote explains why he deleted all his twitter references to APRN and has been extremely quiet regarding the PIPE agreement.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL:DR - Sanberg thinks $20 minimum and doesn't get majority ownership until it gets there. Sanberg strategically chose and placed his Chief Investment Officer on the board of directors at APRN while directly referencing ""enhancing shareholder value (through a potential buyback)"" to the tune of $25,000,000. That'd be over 4,000,000 shares (if $APRN is $6.25 or less at time of buyback), evaporating the float instantly. I think this shit's going down in early-mid September with zero chance of an insider rug pull because of the aforementioned information.

P.S. - The Fintel gamma squeeze and short squeeze boards that people post use algorithms and they don't even take into consideration these possibilities and APRN is already sitting in the top-5 in both (#3 and #4 respectively). 

EDIT: Some of the things that continue to elude people are listed below.

* Market Cap = Shares outstanding\*Current stock price.
* Shares outstanding = total issued shares to all parties. Sanberg's new shares will effect this number.
* Float = The total number of shares that are available for public investors to buy and sell. Sanberg's 10,000,000 new shares will not effect the float.
* What's happening on the 31st? = The August amendment filed with the SEC indicates that the deal gets finalized that day. Meaning APRN will have $25,000,000 at their disposal that they've tagged for, ""enhancing shareholder value (including exploring share buybacks).""
   * Does that mean the buyback will be announced that day? = No.
   * Why does that day matter then? = It could be announced any day after that
   * Will it even happen? = I feel confident it will. If I'm wrong, the stock is undervalued and therefore it's a safe play and I shouldn't be holding any bags regardless.
* Is this a pump and dump? = No.
* What's your position? = I've posted it in the past, it's not had to find.
* What's your price target? = Everyone's is different. I think $20 is feasible since Sanberg's warrants think that's reasonable. If a short/gamma squeeze occur it could blast off higher.
* Don't ask me for an exit strategy or financial advice. My strategy is constantly fluid as more information becomes public and the market is ever changing. Figure out your strategy and execute it.
* What about WEBR, AVYA, BBBY, BBIG, APDN, PRTY, stock? = This is the stock I've done my own DD on; therefore, this is the play I'm personally confident on and requires minimal risk with explosive upside. Any of those other stocks may be good plays too, I just don't follow those tickers closely and am not intimate with their situations."|0.74|18|0|18

market took a massive down after  jerome powell hawkish comments on inflation and interest rate. i feel  like he might cause a recession, so did the market thought too, and  there was a massive sell off. i started looking for recession proof  stocks. like this stock went up 100 percent while the spy took a massive  nose dive. this stock caught my attention when it dropped 25 percent in  a day and there was no negative news.  i dont really know why this huge  dropped happened. there was a earnings call day before and i thought it  was really good. they beat their subscribers estimate, the company  invested $1.1 million in q2, they bought torch wireless for 800k ( this  allows them to sign up people in all 50 states) and in software that  will save them a lot in the future.almost 100k a month savings from this  purchase. i thought the company was moving in the right direction

this  stock is called SURG - their main business is to sign up low income  earners with subsidized internet. they have license to sign up people in  all 50 states.  

Basically they buy these tablets and  sign up people for subsidized internet backed by us government. the us  government pays them back for the tablet and pays them   this is the  projection for this year

For the full year 2022, the Company expects to achieve the following financial targets:

* Total revenues of at least $130 million.
* EBITDA is expected to be at least $15 million.
* Greater than 200,000 subscribers in the mobile broadband business
* Revenue of $28.0 million in the second quarter, an increase of 146% compared to the second quarter of 2021
* Gross profit of $2.2 million in the second quarter, an increase of 65% compared to the second quarter of 2021
* Net loss of $(973) thousand in the second quarter compared to a net loss of $(214) thousand in the year ago period
* EBITDA loss of $(86) thousand in the second quarter of 2022
* as  of June 30 was $8.7 million compared to $6.3 million at the end of  2021. Accounts receivable has increased by over $5 million as wireless  subscriber growth increased to $8.3 million. The receivable is from the  U.S. government for the mobile broadband subsidy. Payment usually occurs approximately 30 to 60 days after a new customer is verified and signed up.

The reason i invested,

i  thought the 25 percent sell off was too much. i thought the earnings  call was really good. they doubled their cash balance and receivables,  liked doubled it... seriously. and they got line of credit backed by  receivables from US Government,  to buy tablets in bulk to they end up  saving 10 to 15 bucks on each tablet. And bought software that will save  them on each subscribers too.

They are signing up 40k to 50k subs per month. They passed 150k subs a month ago.

They  are Uniquely positioned to sign up customers because they basically  offered pre paid debit cards and pre paid wireless service before  getting into mobile broadband. they sold these products in low income  neighbor hood stores and bodegas. They know where they sign up these  customers and they been operating in this space for last 4 years.

They offer anyone who sign up and qualify a brand new 8 to 9 inch tablet.  while the competition only offer sim for existing device.

 

The ceo has a huge skin in the game. The ceo has over 3.4 million shares and he added more recently. no selling.

Recession  proof business? i think so. i think if there is a recession which  jerome powell wants, he wants people to experience ""pain"". i think more  people can qualify if there is full blown recession

This  stock went up 200 percent while nasdaq and spy were down more than 20  percent, and i think it will double from here within a year.

The CEO is aiming to sign up 500k subs by 2023 , while keeping the dilution below 20 million shares"|0.54|1|0|1
t3_x13ssp|1661817105|pennystocks|The stock that will change the world is less than $5 a share|"Globalstar (GSAT $1.99) looked set to be a big star on the stock market Monday, as it bounced more than 10% higher in early trading. That was on the back of growing speculation that the company's technology will be utilized in a hot product made by a top Silicon Valley company. Sentiment on the stock cooled later in the day, though, and Globalstar closed slightly down.

This SV company is Apple (AAPL $166.66). Not for the first time, speculation centers on the company packing satellite calling functionality into its upcoming iPhone. This speculation has been gathering steam, now that we're barely over one week away from Apple's latest ""event,"" as the company calls its new product announcements. Many Apple observers believe a new model, specifically the iPhone 14, will be unveiled at the September show.

Fueling this speculation is the graphic Apple is using to promote the event; it features the company's famous logo depicted as a series of stars in the sky. This could be an implication that satellite calling will be a promoted feature of Apple’s new phone.

In a post on Medium early Monday, popular and closely followed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities said that satellite functionalities were among Apple's test items prior to mass production of the model.

He did not specifically state that the iPhone 14 would have this feature, but did write that ""The operator most likely to partner with Apple for satellite communication is Globalstar.""

As an investor, that should be all the information you need to take a heavy look at GSAT. It’s more than likely that large investment firms and insiders will begin scooping shares of Globalstar before the Apple partnership hits the market.

Party City is not **just** the largest retailer dedicated exclusively to selling party goods; **it's also the largest wholesale distributor and producer of party goods in the world.** The wholesale/distributor part of PRTY is known as Amscan, and I think this is the hidden gem of the business that people don't know about.

This is all to say if you're buying party goods literally anywhere, you're liking supporting PRTY without even knowing. Additionally, [Party City sells directly on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/PartyCity/PartyCity/page/B26E1A61-40CC-4708-83DA-187E7FD38BA8), which means they're also embracing the shift to e-commerce as well.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I also think the average person would assume the company is *""yet another unprofitable shit co that has no fundamentals at all""*, and again, they're wrong.

PRTY is indeed **profitable** and has a **P/E of \~2.0**, which is crazy considering the average of the S&amp;P500 is \~20. It also generates **\~$2 billion in annual revenue despite having a \~$200 million market cap**, resulting in a **P/S of \~0.1**. The fact that this isn't a cool, high flying tech stock that will revolutionize the way we live is a big reason why so many people don't care for it and why it's being overlooked by almost everyone.

It's often the most boring, unsexy companies that yield the highest returns because the perception is baked into the price. Yes, Party City isn't a revolutionary business that will disrupt the world, but it doesn't have to be in order for it to be a successful investment.

I'm almost certain that even AFTER presented with the fact that this has a **P/E of \~2 and a P/S of \~0.1**, many people will then dismiss this information as signs that this is a ""value trap"", at which point I have nothing more to say. People will always shift conflicting data to realign with what they already believe to be true, which is that Party City can't possibly be a good investment, so I'll never be able to convince someone to change their perspective who has already reached a conclusion before they've even looked under the hood.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Another misconception is that if asked to visualize how the stock has performed without seeing any chart, the average person would assume it's been a straight line down and is therefore a bad investment today.

They're misinformed.

[PRTY's performance since IPO.](https://preview.redd.it/rf4m9u6q6qk91.png?width=1404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b6060710a3cad8c3e188eb30a872a6b1ebe9045)

While yes, the 5 year chart shows a -92% decrease in price since its IPO, that doesn't tell the full story at all. If you bought at IPO and literally NEVER averaged down, you'd be down massively, and if you didn't know why this drop happened, you'd quickly assume it's because the business is dead/dying.

[PRTY's Performance from March 2020 lows to June 2021 highs.](https://preview.redd.it/1lx6qgqr6qk91.png?width=1098&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa82d9b012bb21d77730d19cb2365b2e7f9fed83)

However, if you bought during the 2020 lows of $0.30 and sold the June 2021 highs of $11, you'd have netted a whopping 3,200% return on investment! **That's more than TSLA did, and PRTY did so with little to no media coverage or any retail interest whatsoever.**

Fascinating, right?

&amp;#x200B;

So what the fuck happened, and why is it back at $1.80?

Well, there were four major events that drove the stock down:

1. The helium shortage of 2019.
2. The onset of COVID in 2020.
3. Rising interest rates in 2022.
4. Another helium shortage in 2022.

The first major drop was in October 2019 ($7 -&gt; $1.50, a 75% loss) was due to the company dealing with a helium shortage. They only had one helium supplier, so when that one supplier was unable to provide any helium, investors ran for the hill because PRTY was no longer able to sell balloons, which are one of their highest margin items they specialize in. It's one of their main niches.

Insiders bought the dip, showing support that they believe in the business, and it recovered from $1.50 to $3.

Then, in March of 2020, the stock fell again from $3 to $0.30 as everyone assumed that the business was dead. Quarantine was the final nail in the coffin and nobody would be hosting social gatherings during a lock-down, so the company was essentially presumed dead.

However, despite all odds, the company survived and went on to 33x from $0.30 to $11. With the rapid release of vaccines to the public and social distancing ending much, much sooner than anyone could have anticipated, PRTY arose from the dead.

That brings us to 2022. Rising interest rates led to people running away from risky assets like PRTY, which brought the stock from $11 to $3. Then, two earnings ago, they revealed that another helium shortage was occurring, which brought it from $3 back to $1.

Which brings us to this month.

[PRTY's August 2022 performance.](https://preview.redd.it/vy06aufw6qk91.png?width=1382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=262f6a7204a2670416a666971a036ba9917b4c5d)

I know many people will look at the fact that PRTY is up 60% this month and view this as *""another pump you're too late to""*, but the reason why this occurred was because during their latest earnings call, the company reassured investors they were much more prepared to deal with this new helium shortage than they were 3 years ago since they had several helium suppliers this time and that they were confident in this year's Halloween being one of their best.

I'd also argue that part of this surge is from new found retail interest of people looking for ""the next BBBY"" leading this to come up on people's screeners. If this went from $0.30 to $11 with no retail interest, who knows where it can go now that it's gaining traction? It has that meme potential that makes the average investor immediately cringe at the mere mention of it despite having solid fundamentals to back up the bullish argument.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, I don't think merely looking at the performance from its IPO to today is a good means of analyzing whether PRTY is a good investment \*today\*. Like every investment, it has good periods and bad periods, and I'm more inclined to believe PRTY is headed for another good period.

How high will this go? No clue, but I intend to hold my shares for a long time. Halloween is a make or break period that will reveal if PRTY survives and thrives or if it slowly bleeds and dies, and I look forward to seeing how this plays out.

This is a high risk play with high reward, and I advise everyone to be cautious. All this post is trying to do is correct people's misconceptions of Party City and give a brief history of what has historically caused the stock to move up AND down over the last 5 years. Know your risk tolerance, and don't risk money you can't afford to lose.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now for a quick FAQ:

&amp;#x200B;

* *""We're in a recession, and you're posting about a dying brick and mortar party store. What the fuck is wrong with you?""*

First off, I already clarified that the ""dying brick and mortar"" narrative completely disregards Amscan and Party City's storefront on Amazon. I can't understate just how much this common misconception is causing people to avoid the business.

Second off, Party City has endured several recessions and actually has a history of being **recession resistant**. Quoting [this Seeking Alpha author](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4497639-party-city-undervalued-2022-reopening-play):

""Party City is also recession resistant; it grew EBITDA every single year from 2000 to 2018.""

Lastly, I'd argue that a recession is far less scary than the **global lock-down this company has already endured**.  I genuinely believe the company's darkest days are behind them.

&amp;#x200B;

* *""Why would anyone shop at Party City when they can just buy everything on Amazon? Business has no moat.""*

Like I said before, [Party City already sells directly on Amazon.](https://www.amazon.com/stores/PartyCity/PartyCity/page/B26E1A61-40CC-4708-83DA-187E7FD38BA8) They aren't direct competitors. The existence of Amazon also shouldn't distract you from looking for opportunities wherever they may appear nor does its success signify the death of physical retail stores.

As for a moat, the main niche that Party City addresses that Amazon isn't is balloon delivery. You can't ""Amazon Prime"" an inflated balloon, but [you can always depend on Party City to do same day deliveries of them](https://www.partycity.com/balloon-delivery). The balloon business is an incredibly high margin business that Party City is the leader in addressing.

I'd also argue that there's still value in physical stores. People like seeing the things they buy in person BEFORE they buy it to help validate their purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

* *""I haven't shopped there in years / The location by me just closed down / The stores are always empty!""*

Anecdotal evidence will lead you nowhere.

If ""nobody shops there"", how did the company make **\~$2.1 BILLION in revenue** last year?

Why is the ""location by you closing"" a bearish thing? Reducing store count reduces costs from potentially poorly performing locations, which is a good thing. The company had to do everything possible to survive the pandemic, and they have!

The ""stores are always empty"" because \~25% of their revenue comes from solely Halloween. If you ever visit one during Halloween season, you'll be surprised just how packed it is.

&amp;#x200B;

* *""The company has too much debt, BANKRUPTCY IMMINENT! Terminal value is ZERO!!""*

I'm not going to sugarcoat it: the debt load is scary. \~$1.3 billion in debt is nothing to scoff at. I'm also not in denial that bankruptcy is a real possibility.

However, when you're dealing with hairy companies like Party City, you just grow accustomed to it. The verge of bankruptcy is ripe with opportunity, and if you're looking for massive returns, you normally have to take massive risk.

There's also still something to be optimistic about when it comes to their debt given that:

1. The majority of it isn't due until 2026, which is far from ""imminent"". 4 years is plenty of time.
2. They only have to pay roughly \~$40 million of that debt this year, which they should be more than capable of.

PRTY also has more assets than debt ($2.5B &gt; $1.3B), which is healthier than a lot of other struggling retailers.

I also don't think the terminal value is zero. If anything, I see a ""worst case future"" where they close down their physical stores and focus only on Amscan, which would still leave them as the leading wholesale distributor of party goods in the world. That still sounds like an attractive business to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Best of luck to everyone, and thanks for reading."|0.9|348|0|348
t3_x0xd8k|1661801033|pennystocks|$BCDA should Have a DSMB Review Tomorrow Tuesday August 30th. Potential STRONG Catalyst|"TL;DR : BCDA is a stock for a company aiming to solve problems that come with heart disease. There is a strong catalyst tomorrow (or sometime this week) that could make it blast off !

&amp;#x200B;

As we know, Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States.

BCDA develops cellular and cell-derived therapeutics for cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases.

Its lead therapeutic candidate is the CardiAMP Cell Therapy System is for the treatment of heart failure and chronic myocardial ischemia. Very interesting and impressive technology tbh

On August 30th (tomorrow) there should be a review on BioCardia's CardiAMP techonology for heart failure. Shares of BioCardia have soared in the past off positive CardiAMP developments.

As a short term play there have been some huge 1-2 day runs in the past that can be evidenced by their overall chart. But im here to advocate looking at it as a long term play.

Just researching the news about them and their press releases,  Peter Altman and the management have been making many moves towards the success of BCDA in the future.

Recent Earnings have showed BCDA increased revenue $1 million in 2021, compared to $145,000 Their net loss was $12.6 million in 2021, compared to $15.0 million in 2020, etc.

In Aug 2022, it was reported BioCardia, Inc. (BCDA) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.14 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.28. This compares to loss of $0.20 per share a year ago.

BCDA (which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics stock group)  posted revenues of $0.97 million for the quarter ended June 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 412.63%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $0.07 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.

&amp;#x200B;

They're definitely not doing amazing, with their price being the lowest its ever been but this isn't a bad time to start investing either!

On August 24, by Zacks Equity Research , it was mentioned BCDA has returned about 6.2% since the start of the calendar year. Meanwhile, stocks in the same Medical group have lost about 17.5% on average. This means that BioCardia, Inc. is outperforming the sector as a whole this year.

Heart disease is serious, and can evidently make some companies quite profitable if they solve problems and offer solutions associated with it. So a few months into 2022 I wanted to find a low priced company offering solutions about it then I found BCDA. I've been grabbing shares since May 2022, with an average of 1.35 and haven't regretted it.

This is all to say do your own DD , and this isn't financial advice.

But i'm in BCDA and hopefully by tomorrow we'll get some positive news for a potentially strong bullish catalyst!"|1.0|3|0|3

If the pandemic is weakening, online payments remain, and the market keeps growing. It represents an investment opportunity, and many small-cap companies could become essential players in this industry.

**The Online Payment Market Keeps on Growing**

The online payment sector will interest you if you are looking for a market with an “endless” growth opportunity. With the Covid-19 pandemic reducing human interactions, consumers found their happiness online, and online payments became a regular habit, first during the lockdowns and then in our day-to-day lives. Both companies and consumers saw in this technology the opportunity to save time by buying/selling online. According to many surveys, online payments should constitute a more prominent aspect of our buying routine. Another important data is digitalization is boosting the payment market. Smartphones and high penetration of internet connectivity buoy the demand for mobile payment transactions.

**The global online payment market was valued at $3,286.52 B in 2019 &amp; is projected to reach $17,643.35 B by 2027, at a CAGR of 23.7% in the forecast period.**

Future catalysts will occur in the sector, including incorporating Artificial Intelligence to increase the transactional volume and enhance payment processing. Governments are also pushing these platforms to augment security and transparency, reducing corruption and fraudulent activities. For example, India’s government saved almost USD $8.8B by adopting the online banking payment mode in its fuel subsidy program during 2013-2020.

**Readen Holding (OTC: RHCO) Has Everything to Become a Significant Player**

Among many competitors, Readen Holding reveals to be an underdog in the industry. The company has decided to pursue an investment strategy focusing on payment, e-commerce, and supporting infrastructure technologies. The company acquired OkePay in 2021, a go-to solution for all online payment needs. Okepay is a payment solution that enables a merchant to accept all payment methods supported by an easy integration process. The company also owns OkeApp, an intercompany of OkePay, which helps participating merchants incur no direct payment fees. Merchants benefit from above- and below-the-line marketing campaigns provided by OkeApp. On August 3, RHCO announced a new development of OkeApp. The company launched Oke Travel Club. This development is a worldwide selection of travel-related services and products designed to offer OkeApp members significant price reductions on all travel needs globally. The membership program will provide a selection of 1 million+ locations of hotel and resorts, 205,000+ retail shops, 60,000+ restaurants, 45,000+ car rentals, 500+ airlines and 50+ major cruise lines.

If the company’s products are great, its revenues are even better, as shown in the previous quarter. Readen Holding’s financials kept improving, with a 634% increase quarter-over-quarter (2022/03/31 financial statement). The company even reported a shallow income of $66K. These positive revenues were carried by the ongoing development of OkeApp and the increased revenue in Readies. RHCO also mentioned that its Fintech division, including OkePay, OkeApp, and Readies, has recorded a 700% revenue gain in January 2022 compared to December 2021. January’s revenue approximately equaled the division’s total revenue in the last six months of 2021.

On August 26, the company shared its improved financials for the period ending June 30, proving the company is headed toward the right direction. Readen Holding’s revenue was up 283% compared to 2021 and achieved impressive Earnings from Operation, up 25% year-over-year. The company has, however, reported a loss in Net Profit due to the underperformance of the share price in Tianrong Medical Group, Inc. (OTC: TNMD). The company ramps up pretty fast and should outperform in Q4 2022 with the full launch of OkeApp, and the Angelo Mermer investment.

**Most Recent News**

Readen Holding (RHCO) announced on August 24 multiple amendments to previous transactions. To give some retrospect, the company acquired early 2021 64 acres of the prime real estate alongside the Rhone River in France and planned to develop 690 houses, villas, and apartments for sale and lease. To complete this transaction, the purchase price was 15M shares of RHCO common stocks. Due to multiple tax and legal issues, the selling party failed to deliver the required documents for constructing permission. Nevertheless, Readen Holding has found a positive outlook. The company has agreed with Angelo Mermer (Turkey’s largest holder of marble reserves) to sell the real estate. The transaction is worth EU $2M and was converted to a 50% discount into 200 shares of Angelo Mermer (5% of total Angelo Mermer shares) and is worth approximately USD $5M, according to Baker Tilly.

Despite the cancellation of the real estate acquisition, RHCO has honored the deal with ANGELO MERMER. Instead of real estate, RHCO has paid ANGELO MERMER with 15 million shares of RHCO common stocks restricted. RHCO now has the right to handle the sales and export of ANGELO MERMER’s raw onyx marble blocks into China. Such exporting operations have started recently, with marble blocks being sold and shipped to China and Italy.

**“Even though the real estate deal did not work out, we have full confidence in our investment in ANGELO MERMER. That’s why we want to continue to work with ANGELO MERMER. With Turkey’s currency and liquidity crisis, we realize the opportunity to minimize the cost of marble export, thus increasing the profit margin on the export of the products. Trading onyx marble to China would bring us sizable profit for years to come.”**

&gt;August 25, 2022 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time

&gt;ELK CITY, Idaho--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Therapeutic Solutions International announced today filing with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) an amendment to its currently open Phase III clinical trial requesting expansion of eligible patients with all patients suffering from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) regardless of cause.

&gt;“We are honored to be guided by Key Opinion Leaders such as our SAB member Dr. Donald Banerji, former Head of Novartis Respiratory Medicine, during this process of taking JadiCell from an experimental research project into what appears to be a lifesaving medicine”

&gt;The Company is currently only recruiting patients with advanced ARDS caused by COVID-19. The newly proposed criteria will allow all patients suffering from this condition to be eligible for entry into the clinical trial

Since, per the below FDA website, review time for initial IND is 30 days, positive FDA response is expected within the month resulting in potential upward catalyst for the stock price, which is currently near 52 week lows:

https://www.fda.gov/drugs/investigational-new-drug-ind-application/ind-applications-clinical-investigations-overview

The results of phase 1/2a Jadicell clinical trial, published in the linked paper below, in patients suffering from COVID-19 ARDS showed significantly improved survival rate amongst treated patients of 100% for patient ages under 85 and 91% overall compared to 42% in the control group:

 https://doi.org/10.1002/sctm.20-0472

The Principal Investigator of the above trial Dr. Camillo Ricordi was featured in an MSNBC interview, for which a clip was shared on Twitter by Dr. Amit Patel, inventor of Jadicell and the link for that can be found in my daily play thread comment below (twitter links are not allowed in original posts on this sub):

https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/x0iznn/daily_plays_august_29_2022/im8k7ch?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3

Based on the above stellar results from its phase 1/2a clinical trial, the above therapy would also qualify for Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation, which would shorten FDA review of the BLA application to just 6 months, as described in the below article:

https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/regenerative-medicine-advanced-therapy-the-latest-special-fda-designation

We will know when FDA response is received for the IND amendment request, whether RMAT designation was requested and if it was approved. 

IMO, this is a good buying opportunity for the stock. The stock is also currently under some pressure from the shorts, as the below daily short volume data would indicate, but the short volume is not too high to be overcome by a good ol' short squeeze.

Now, these companies are not competitors, in fact I can realistically see CATL using KULR to further improve their product. CATL grew 3400% from 2016 to 2020, they have partners with: BMW, Honda, Volkswagen, Volvo, Tesla, and more. They have, since the time of the source I am using, 26% of the market share in EV battery making (tied with LG Energy).   


Now, I know that KULR doesn't make EV batteries, but both CATL and KULR are undervalued companies in my eyes. Me, personally, I am going to be looking to pick up some shares of CATL company once they IPO. AND with KULR's CAGR being over 20% since their inception (outpacing the lithium-ion battery market CAGR of 8.2%), I will likely be eyeing the charts to find a great spot to pick some shares in the future. 

KULR and CATL are both pointing to outperformance and severe undervaluance, in my humble opinion.

Geol., have resigned as directors of the Company, in order to welcome the appointments of two new independent directors to the board of directors (the ""Board""), Keith Peck and Peter Gundy, in their place. Sean Mager will continue to act as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company.

Keith Peck is Chair and CEO of Lincoln Peck Financial Inc., a financial advisory firm focused on the resources sector, and a Chartered Business Valuator with over 35 years of investment banking experience, including as vice-president and director of RBC Dominion Securities Inc., Haywood Securities Inc. and vice-chair of Yorkton Securities Inc.

Mr. Peck was a founder of Centenario Copper Corporation which was acquired by Quadra Mining Ltd. in 2009. Mr. Peck was more recently chair of Orezone Gold Corporation and was a director and audit committee chair of Bluestone Resources Inc.

Peter Gundy was a co-founder of Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (a predecessor to Nutrien) and the founder of Neo Material Technologies Inc (""NEM""), serving as NEM's chief executive officer and chair from 1992 to 2008. NEM became a global leader in the production of advanced rare earth metals also used in the electronics industries and automotive sectors. In 2012, NEM was sold to Molycorp for $1.1 billion. Mr. Gundy has served as a director with numerous publicly traded companies, and currently serves on the board of Andean Precious Metals, where he is chair of both its audit committee and nomination and corporate governance committee.

In addition to changes in the composition of the Board, the Company has appointed Keith Peck as the independent Lead Director of the Board. John Williamson will remain as executive Chairman and CEO. As Lead Director, Mr. Peck will provide leadership to the Board and the independent directors and facilitate the functioning of the Board independently of management, working together with the executive Chairman. The Company has also reconstituted its Audit Committee to be comprised solely of independent directors, within the meaning of National Instrument 52-110 - *Audit Committees*. Effective immediately, the members of the Audit Committee are Mr. Peck, Mr. Gundy and Mr. Toby Pierce. Mr. Gundy has been appointed Chair of the Audit Committee. In accordance with best governance practices, the reconstituted Board has also resolved to form an independent Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee (""GNC Committee""), comprised of Mr. Peck, Mr. Gundy and Mr. Pierce. The new GNC Committee will assist the Board with respect to governance, nominating and compensation matters relating to the Company.

John Williamson, Chairman and CEO, said: ""We are very pleased to welcome Keith and Peter to Benchmark's Board. As seasoned veterans with proven track records in the resources sector, and deep expertise in public company governance, strategy, capital markets and strong financial and business acumen, we are confident these changes and governance enhancements will complement the existing Board structures and help strengthen Benchmark's performance and long-term value for the benefit of all of the Company's shareholders and key stakeholders. On behalf of the Board, I'd also like to thank Michael and Sean for their past Board service."""|0.68|10|0|10

They released a very straightforward update this morning stating they have placed their first Purchase Order for the pet CGM and a global leader in animal health will begin selling it in October. They expect to announce the global leader in the coming weeks.

$ALRT has a market cap of $29M with only 120M shares in the tradeable float (the rest are restricted). Almost all of the global leaders in animal health are publicly traded companies worth billions and billions. If they put out a joint press release $ALRT stock will go from $0.05 to $0.25-$0.50 easy in my opinion.

 These are the global leaders in animal health and their revenue last year:

1. Zoetis: $7.8 Billion (**Pharmaceutical company**)
2. Merck Animal Health: $5.6 Billion (**Pharmaceutical company**)
3. Elanco: $4.7 Billion (**Pharmaceutical company**)
4. MWI: $4-6 Billion - not directly reported through parent company (**Global Distributor**)
5. Covetrus: $4.6 Billion (**Global Distributor**)
6. Boehringer Ingelheim: $4.3 Billion (**Pharmaceutical company**)
7. Patterson: $3.6 Billion (**Global Distributor**)

See my previous Reddit DD post on ALRT here for more detail: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/wdgy95/alrt\_will\_at\_minimum\_double\_from\_0045\_to\_009\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/wdgy95/alrt_will_at_minimum_double_from_0045_to_009_in/)

But to summarize, there are 2 million diabetic pets in the US and EU and they go in on average 3 times a year for diabetes monitoring, veterinarians perform a ""Blood Glucose Curve"" where the animal is dropped off for 10-12 hours and the Vet draws blood every 2 hours to test the blood sugar levels. This is expensive, time consuming, rough on the pet, and the Vet gets very little data to work with.

ALRT solved this by making a CGM for pets which they say is cheaper, gets put on in a few minutes, and the animal goes home with their owner where the CGM automatically takes blood sugar readings every 3 minutes for 14 days and uploads the data to a veterinary portal that gives them all kinds of advanced features to make treating diabetes as easy as possible.

This is going to be huge, ask any veterinarian. Vets are so desperate for a better way to treat diabetes that some of them are prescribing a human CGM called the freesytle libre. Which means the pet owner has to go to a pharmacy and get it and come back for the vet to put it on, which means the vet cant sell it to make money. It also has a ton of issues because its made for humans... But long story short, there is a huge need for ALRT's product.

FYI, ALRT trades on the [OTC.BB](https://OTC.BB) market which is the higher level tier that is fully SEC reporting like wallstreet companies. But only realy stock brokers allow you to buy and sell them like Etrade, TD ameritrade, Charles Schwab, etc. You can't trade ALRT on Robin Hood. They have announced they are going to be uplisting for the NYSE next year which shows they expect huge revenue soon,"|0.61|7|0|7

**Part 3: Short Squeeze and Gamma**

# Part 1: Introduction to Avaya

Avaya is a company that sells desktop phones, conference phones, video conferencing devices, etc. Basically, they sell communication devices to companies of all sizes. They aim to combine all aspects of communication, from voice to video chat, into one single integrated platform.

Avaya has over 100k customers in 190 countries. These customers include big companies such as banks like **Citigroup**, **Deutsche Bank**, **Citigroup**, and **Bank of America**, **Apple**, **American Express**, **General Motors**, **UPS**, and **Walmart**. Their client base is extremely valuable as one can tell.

Avaya is in corporate offices all over the world, so they are not an unknown company, but a legacy one. Avaya is shifting its focus to its cash-cow Avaya OneCloud, which is ""a cloud-based communications solution that consolidates all the traditional business phone system features into a single, unified platform"". OneCloud is projected to hit $1B in annual recurring revenue by the end of the year. They are also aggressively cutting costs which includes laying off employees among other things.

# Part 2: Key Fundamental Metrics

As of writing, Avaya is currently making around **$3B** in revenue with a market cap of **$114M**. Free float (the number of shares that are tradable and available to the public is at **71M**. They have **$2.83B** in debt and **-$1.47B** net income TTM.

# Part 3: Short Squeeze and Gamma Squeeze

First of all, I gambled all my money into AVYA, so I cannot afford to have into that is 100% up to date on short stats. The stats I use will be from the other Reddit posts down below. The stock has above **95% short utilization**. Cost To Borrow is increasing at an exponential rate, and so is the amount of short interest. Short interest is currently at **around 80%**. How is this the case? Institutions currently hold a lot of the free float, which roughly leaves 19.8 million shares in public float. The new CEO of Avaya was given **$4M** to purchase stock, so we can assume that shares are being bought back right now. Assuming that the CEO buys 3-4M shares, we will have **15.8-16.8M shares in public float**. Current short interest is **around 16.4M**, so that leaves us with **97.6-103.7% SI % of free float** (assuming institutions hold onto shares). Conservatively, short interest could be around **75-85%**, so even that number is astronomically high. It looks like the institutions and management could be trying to force a short squeeze. Short except volume has increased substantially over the past few trading sessions. This alludes to the fact that FTDs are potentially increasing, an indication that AVYA might face a surge in price action in the foreseeable future.

I'm not an expert in terms of options, so I had to search up what a gamma squeeze is. A gamma squeeze is when a lot of call options are bought by investors due to a sharp increase in stock price. Market makers can be forced into short positions if there is a large amount of buying of short-dated call options. Currently, according to Fintel, AVYA is **#6** on its gamma squeeze leaderboard, even above BBBY. It has hovered around the top 5 for a few days now. Its ""Gamma Squeeze Score"" is 98.39. This is huge as not only is a short squeeze in play, but a gamma squeeze as well. These are two big, positive catalysts for the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

[#6 on Fintel's Gamma Squeeze Leaderboard, above BBBY.](https://preview.redd.it/ht513jyozmk91.png?width=2525&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa2005d011fc274e4348953d2b6e8088316ea8fe)

# Part 4: Technical Analysis

Analyzing AVYA's movements over the past few days, we have a lot of info we can go through. The stock recently gapped down from $2 to \~$1.3. Shares continued to trend lower, until we reached the bottom at around 0.60. Since then, we have had strong upwards momentum due to the fact that volume has increased significantly during the leg up. Right now, shares of AVYA look on track to fill that $2 gap. 50MA is at $1.84, so we look to be hitting that and possibly trading between the 50MA and $2. If stock breaks 50MA, it is a bullish sign that says that we are headed higher. From my previous DD, we established a strong support at $1 due to a long period of time of barcoding. Read that to see how that is important.

&amp;#x200B;

[Gap at $2 looking to be filled.](https://preview.redd.it/31pyn2fszmk91.png?width=1416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51842b5ef3246da07a53c532cf4cb4be0d1b274f)

As mentioned before, we have seen strong volume while the price was moving up. The stock is up 116.39% from its lows with an average volume of 34.8M. For the past few days, where the stock has gotten most of its gains, we have had an average volume of around 60M. That is almost trading its full float everyday! On Friday, AVYA fell 13% on 34.84M volume. This indicates that buying pressure is still driving the price higher. On-Balance Volume can confirm this. We have seen OBV balloon over the past few trading days, indicating extreme strength that is carrying the stock upwards. Friday's dip barely registered on OBV, so that is something we don't have to worry about. Currently RSI is at 50, which is in the midrage of the indicator, so it is not overbought nor oversold.

&amp;#x200B;

[OBV skyrocketed over the past few trading sessions.](https://preview.redd.it/h2gghv6tzmk91.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82de9ff9fb661d101289638a277a381fa21d21a9)

&amp;#x200B;

[AVYA is moving close to its 50MA.](https://preview.redd.it/bhjz8ottzmk91.png?width=1274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4cd5033b1540d4745b06ef42af7649d7d661aca)

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at options (reminder, I'm no expert), we can see that AVYA's option chain has experienced a lot of volume, especially on the calls side of things. This open interest and change in volume shows that more and more people are betting on AVYA's rise. We'll talk about the rise in bond prices later, but that also plays a factor in AVYA's price action.

&amp;#x200B;

[AVYA Call options chain, we see a significant increase in volume!](https://preview.redd.it/iexivpcvzmk91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad6bf7f967871569765f31e51fd42ce0aafb8316)

Just a reminder, the stock was trading around the $20 range at the start of the year. There is potentially a lot of room to go.

# Part 5: CEO, Insiders, and Institutions

In the beginning of August, Avaya fired their previous CEO Jim Chirico and brought in Alan Masarek, who was the CEO of Vonage Holdings. Looking at Masarek's tenure at Vonage, he joined as CEO in November 2014, the share price of Vonage was $3.51. He voluntarily stepped down in July 2020, when the share price was around $10, so we know Masarek is capable of helping a company perform well. He also was the co-founder of Quickoffice, which was acquired by Google in June 2012. Just something to keep in mind for later.

&amp;#x200B;

[Vonage Holdings' stock performance when current CEO Masarek was in charge.](https://preview.redd.it/fvxwrvnxzmk91.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0865d32161379794edec16a22878663939bb108a)

Masarek was given $4M to purchase stock in ""open market transactions"". This was talked about previously in the post, but it gives shareholders a reason to be optimistic as shares are being bought back which increases shareholder value.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1w8cfzgyzmk91.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f9b2a5a842df2aba0fcabb6e35a9247b88ead76

Just recently, an insider by the name King Theodore had bought 13.2M shares of AVYA, or around 14% of the public float. Theodore is working with Avaya to turn the ship around, giving suggestions such as a buyout and other information that Avaya management can use to help the company stay afloat. The fact that an activist investor has just recently bought a significant stake in the company should be a bullish sign.

&amp;#x200B;

[Filing from King Theodore after buying insider stake.](https://preview.redd.it/xb0fhc9zzmk91.png?width=1324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b0830b44ec30b07e8caeecf3e4c31b609278eb5)

The bigger side to the story of AVYA stock is the fact that institutions own an insane amount of AVYA stock. Webull says that institutions hold **107.76%** of the stock. That's not far off from the truth. According to Fintel, they have institutions holding **128.35%** of the stock. Okay, the numbers may not be precise, but we can gather that institutions are holding an insane amount of the stock. This limits the amount of shares floating which, as previously mentioned, leads to short interest being as high as it is.

&amp;#x200B;

[Institutional shares held at 128.35&amp;#37;!](https://preview.redd.it/g90rvk200nk91.png?width=1299&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c67723890289c16ea22dfc0b49b0b7042924876b)

All these three factors only increase the chances of a short squeeze. When it happens, I have no idea, but the possibility is certainly there.

# Part 6: Concerns

Now all plays are not without their concerns, especially this one. Avaya has been dying as a company, with all key financials basically taking a nosedive. In the latest quarter, revenue surprised to the downside when Avaya published preliminary Q3/22 results. This, along with news that the company has substantial doubt to continue, has caused the stock to drop like a rock. The decreasing revenue puts into question the company's ability to pay its debt, which it has around **$2.8B** of. This puts it at significant risk of bankruptcy. Not to mention that their credit score has been **downgraded to CCC-** by Fitch. A score of CCC- means that creditors predict that Avaya is likely to go bankrupt, unless a lot of things go in their favor. **The company has previously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy**, with it coming out of it in 2017. The fact that the risk of another bankruptcy is so high shows that AVYA might not have any more legs to go anywhere as a company.

&amp;#x200B;

[Even the company is concerned about its risk of bankruptcy.](https://preview.redd.it/lpt5gds00nk91.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=901ede301b83e8ca2ad74344adca8728989e94d0)

# Part 7: Additional Notes

Here are some bonus stuff that I'd like to throw in.

Personally, I check Google Trends and Stocktwits to see search/message activity for a stock to see if more and more people are looking at/talking about it. If we look at Google search activity for AVYA, we can see that it has skyrocketed to highs never seen before. Stocktwits messaging activity under the AVYA symbol has also skyrocketed, from **a few hundred messages** to **over six thousand a day**.

&amp;#x200B;

[Google Trends data on AVYA. Search volume has exploded!](https://preview.redd.it/epb3wxm10nk91.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=335b13a1fc700782006e789eb0d2914433c5fbb9)

&amp;#x200B;

[Message volume on Stocktwits for AVYA has also taken off!](https://preview.redd.it/a23qa8c20nk91.png?width=625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e4c41c438cee37ee6033e97ffdcd5735e8ed8f0)

&amp;#x200B;

Another key piece of information, Avaya has released its Q3/22 quarterly report to private investors. After this news came out, we saw an **increase in bond prices** for AVYA. Bond prices rising indicates a belief among private investors that Avaya has a realistic plan of turning their business around. It is significant to say the least.

[Looking at bond prices, we have seen them increase substantially.](https://preview.redd.it/h155g5830nk91.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc41c68b1a986802fb850f83310bb96e74bffb9c)

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently **all three short squeeze signals were triggered** on ORTEX, so that could also imply that there is a short squeeze imminent.

https://preview.redd.it/nzxpfjt30nk91.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b18827308817f044229ccb4b48f4c3497834bbf

Realistically, Avaya would probably get bought out instead of going bankrupt. Theodore King has pushed for this to be a real possibility, and you can't blame him. The client base Avaya has is high quality, so purchasing them would make them a valuable asset to any company looking to expand their client base reach.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Many signs point to a short squeeze and gamma squeeze, and so many signs point to a turnaround businesswise. Institutional investors, insiders, and CEO buying shares. Very risky. Buy buy buy.

&amp;#x200B;

Positions: 25,000 shares, possibly adding more but holding off for now."|0.81|79|0|79

What I like about stocks with ""known dates"" is you can play them two ways, for the run-up to (buy the rumor sell the news), or to just buy on the date of FDA approval if it occurs. So there is two ways of making money on this play to the upside. Biotech stocks that receive FDA approval have been seen returning over 100-200%+ in gains, and with $ACER being such a bottomed-out, low-float stock, this may occur.

[$ACER - weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/97j884b1ijk91.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0da0f33a0394602d0ecd2a4dfc7dbd6a7104ec53)

This is a potential month-long swing into September in anticipation of FDA approval. The FDA accepts ACER's inborn metabolism disorder therapy refiling for review, for ACER-001.

https://preview.redd.it/5rj1wyl0gjk91.png?width=582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c06e225ef236347a2883b868eee616657456241

Recently, $ACER entered into a credit agreement, and when I read the SEC filing I came across this statement:  


[SEC filing, listed 5 days ago.](https://preview.redd.it/ielkq30qgjk91.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d32de7d323272fde04bd1ea642b0dc172d42d6e0)

As we can see here, it's about the same drug, ""ACER-001"", and here we have the date of September 30, 2022. So we can potentially get a PR on or before this date. The last ""popular"" known FDA date was $OCGN which went from $7 to $17 in about 20 days, and had a bigger float. The float for $ACER is less than 15M and is only trading at $1.5. It's important to note that on their investors presentation, they have a PDUFA date on Jan 15, 2023, but the target action date does not guarantee timing of decision by the FDA (they even say this themselves). Furthermore, Acer Therapeutics has, in the past, received priority review from the FDA for one of their other drugs too.

# How I am playing this Stock

If there is long-term potential in the stock and the company proves itself, I do not mind being a long term investor. If the company doesn't prove itself, then I remain in this for a trade. I only have a small size in this position as of right now.. I only have a small size because these FDA stocks can be very risky, it either hits big and I will be paid big, and if not, the loss will be a scratch due to my small position-sizing. My plan is to buy a small amount of stock and average in, and wait a month for either a run-up to the FDA date, or a until we get approval if there is no run-up to buy the rumor and sell the news. So overall, it's high risk and high reward, but I like how the chart is bottomed out so downside is limited with proper risk management.

It's important to keep in mind of the dates, so far I've mentioned:

* Sept 12 - conference (not as important)
* Sept 30 - from SEC filing
* Jan 15, 2023 - target PDUFA date, if not Sept 30.
* March 24, 2024 - from SEC filing

$SONX has been beaten down severely in the last 9 months and now sits under $1 ($0.92), while still containing a buy rating and an analyst price target well over $5. Currently, I am looking at this as a long position ($3-$5) and believe that as long as they can continue to execute, they will likely see potential to be purchased by a bigger company.

I was hoping someone could help provide some more insight/analysis on the company as a whole, as well as any tips/trick about things to look for, and where to look for them!

Providing some basic information below but would love some insight/input!

Thanks all and BOL on all of your investments.

**Sonendo, Inc. is** a commercial-stage medical technology company focused on saving teeth from tooth decay, the most prevalent chronic disease globally. Sonendo develops and manufactures the GentleWave® System, an innovative technology platform designed to treat tooth decay by cleaning and disinfecting the microscopic spaces within teeth without the need to remove tooth structure. The system utilizes a proprietary mechanism of action, which combines procedure fluid optimization, broad-spectrum acoustic energy and advanced fluid dynamics, to debride and disinfect deep regions of the complex root canal system in a less invasive procedure that preserves tooth structure. The clinical benefits of the GentleWave System when compared to conventional methods of root canal therapy include improved clinical outcomes, such as superior cleaning that is independent of root canal complexity and tooth anatomy, high and rapid rates of healing and minimal to no post-operative pain. In addition, the GentleWave System can improve the workflow and economics of dental practices.

Founded in 2012 out of the friendly nation of Canada, [Galway Metals](https://galwaymetalsinc.com/) is engaged in digging deep, getting their hands dirty, and going fully hard on the acquisition and development of sustainable, precious metals. In addition to maintaining a focus on mineral resource management, one of the most financially prudent industries on the market, Galway also reaches around investment concerns to optimize their triple-bottom-line financially, socially, and environmentally.

Oh, and did I mention their symbol is **GAYMF?**

**Why YOU Should Get GAYMF**

In addition to having what may be hands down the most memeable ticker symbol in existence, GAYMF is genuinely positioned with open opportunities to fully take investors. Leveraging an astute eye for extensive shafts, Galway Metals is utilizing Open Pit accessibility to capitalize on natural environmental conditions while minimizing energy and expenses.

With multiple new partner sites pending, a thirst for new opportunities, and extra heavy assets, GAYMF is not only the right buy, it’s the right buy for your exceptionally broke ass. 

For less than **$0.30 per share**, you can board this pleasantly plebian rocket ship and rest easy knowing you’ve put your money where your supple mouth is and you’re finally among “friends,” flying from your lonely living room to the moon.

**What To Know Before You YOLO**

Especially with our current market volatility, there is no such thing as a “sure thing.” That’s why prudent investors rely on financial valuation, risk analysis, and objective memeability to combat the market going soft unpredictably, even though elderly analysts swear that almost never happens. 

Let’s face it, at some point amidst these wild market fluctuations, you may get shafted on a bad trade, but that’s no reason to take a loss lying down! 

**Conclusion: Fully Hard Buy**

With a bottom line so fine, you could bounce a bitcoin off it and the tastiest ticker sign on this side of the NYSE, GAYMF is a buy so hard you may need to call your doctor if your portfolio is engorged for longer than 4 business days. 

Don’t get caught with your pants down by modern market fluctuations.   
 Get your assets prepped for proliferation.  
 Get GAYMF and join the celebration!"|0.71|95|0|95

They were in a similar situation not too long ago.|"First Wave BioPharma (FWBI) just did a reverse split. Free float is now under one million shares and the price target is $270 if you take the reverse split into account. The price target is set by Roth Capital on May 26, 2022. Check the price target on Webull.

What's crazy is AzurRx Bio bought First Wave Bio last year (Sept) for $229 million and today they have a combined market cap of under $5 million so the target price of $270 isn't that weird.

But it's unimportant because I would never invest in Bio long-term because of the risks.

I think I see a fairly good short-term investment due to the fact that the stock is heavily shorted and if the price starts to rise upwards, so I see a fairly large opportunity for squeeze as the short ones made a good profit already and can cover their positions. Or even need do it to make as big a profit as possible.

Should the price go up without them having covered their positions, it will not be as big of a profit for them. Of course, unless they see an opportunity for even bigger profits because they think the price may go down further.

It's obviously just speculation based on the fact that I've seen RHE, NVIV, QNRX and a few more where something similar happened.

Reverse stock split. 1 for 30 

As for the number of shares before and after split, many people are wrong. It's not about how many shares you have, but how many percent of the company you/you own, and that's as much after as it was before the split. No difference. 

This panic that people get in connection with the reverse split only happens in the USA and not in a single other country in the world. Whether it's about ignorance or something else, I don't know. But at least I know that this is exploited by shorts. The news about the revrese split always causes the price (in the US) to plummet, so then shorts are in a very good position."|0.63|4|0|4

Here are some key highlights about them, which I gathered from their latest news release:

* US$110 Billion North American Fintech Industry (projected CAGR of 19.8%): Marble is well-positioned to capitalize on the market opportunity with its unique technology offerings 
* B2B Partnerships: Marble has secured 20+ B2B clients for its Connect API and signed 100+ licensing agreements for its Inverite banking verification software 
* Client Base: Alternative lending services companies such as thirdstream (6.4+ million customers), 8Twelve, Citadel Mortgages, [Konect.ai](https://Konect.ai), Nuborrow, Lendforall, and more 
* Cost-Effective Approach to Driving Sales: Through channel partnerships, the MyMarble platform currently has over 37,000 members, and its Inverite banking verification software has collected over 2 million unique customer financial data points on its platform to date 
* Focus on Technology Innovation: Marble is continuing its development efforts for new innovative technology to expand the Company’s competitive moat by offering cutting-edge AI-powered solutions 
* U.S. Expansion: Marble plans to enter the U.S. market in 2022 through partnerships with businesses that operate in the United States 
* Active M&amp;A Pipeline: Marble plans to advance its M&amp;A strategy by pursuing opportunities for additional accretive and synergistic acquisitions to scale its operations

t3_wyf266|1661534865|pennystocks|Insiders of $PRTY have acquired 3.5% of shares outstanding in the past 12 months at a median price of ~$5.13. Movement from current share price of $1.85 to $5.13 would be a 177% increase.|"**TL;DR -- Insiders have accumulated 3.5% of $PRTY's shares outstanding in the past year, and the CEO holds 2.5% of shares outstanding. Extremely bullish indicator that insiders believe in the deep value of the company.**

One thing I haven't seen anybody post about is the extent to which Insiders are betting on Party City Holdco. The general idea being that if people who are closest to the company are investing, it means things are looking good.

A couple things I've found...

* The largest shareholder of $PRTY is a value based investing firm called CAS Investment Partners. It looks like they've accumulated roughly 19M of the 113M total shares outstanding. Their only sell was of ~400K shares on May 9th (the day the stock totally shit the bed). Otherwise they accumulated a ton of shares prior to that and are still holding. Notably, they built a lot of their position when the stock was between $3 and $7 -- obviously a lot of upside from the current price to there. If they were seeing deep value at those prices then we're in great shape. I will flag that CAS has shit the bed in 2022 -- but this is largely because of a large position in Carvana, a pandemic darling that has gone downhill this year (about 25% of their equity is in this firm). **I have reached out to CAS to see if they will share any information regarding their investment thesis -- will let you all know if they come back with anything.**

* The only major seller of $PRTY stock is James Harrison, former CEO and current Vice Chairman. He offloaded the majority of his shares in 2020 and 2021 after leaving the CEO seat. He's also approaching age 70, so presumably he's offloading because he's not running the company any more and he's getting older so he needs to cash out to live the retirement life. **Every other major insider is buying and holding $PRTY**

* Saving perhaps best for last -- our CEO Brad Weston has been loading up his bags and getting ready for blast off! Of 113M shares outstanding he owns approximately 3M shares!! Also, he has accumulated the overwhelming majority of these in 2022. He was buying when the stock was over $8, and he has continued to buy and hold. This is an incredible amount for a non-founding CEO to hold of a publicly traded company -- traditionally non-founding CEOs would hold way less than even 1% of shares (per HBR, 9 of 10 CEOs own less than 1% of stock).

* Insiders have accumulated ~5.2M shares and sold ~1.2M shares in the past 12 months, for a net accumulation of 4M shares. Meaning **in the past year, where share prices have been at a median of ~$5 USD, insiders have decided to build an increased position, taking over an additional 3.5% of the company.**

The man closest to and responsible for the operations of this company is all in on the value that this stock represents. This is a career retail operator who understands what it takes to execute and drive value for this company. Now it's just on the market to recognize that value.

t3_wy7y7o|1661517001|pennystocks|(OTC:RHCO) Readen Holding Has So Much to Offer Investors $RHCO|"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bf8ptq2jx1k91.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57ca7d415710b46af0757b8055b7f0ec99f9e028

Readen Holding Corporation RHCO (OTC PINK: RHCO) is a venture capital corporation that has undergone various partnerships and acquisitions to become its current conglomerate of companies. Its corporate history dates back to over 30 years. RHCO is made up of companies in the marketing, fintech, retail, tourism, and advertising sectors. Its subsidiaries have operations and offices across Europe and Asia. The corporate headquarters was moved back to Hong Kong in 2020 but it has announced plans to move the head office to Singapore very soon.

Though a diversified corporation, RHCO has focused majorly on financial services; providing online payment solutions, e-commerce, and fintech solutions.

**Popular products**

Here are some of RHCO’s products:

• OkePay: an internet payment solution for merchants and shoppers

• OkeApp: a payment referral app that has a reward system

• READIES: A prepaid e-voucher used for anonymous online payments

• Oke Retail: online retail directly to consumers

• Fullness Grace: an advertising firm

• Fligro Ltd: a food trading company

**OkePay**

OkePay is an all-in-one solution for online payments. Its technology is built to integrate and aggregate other payment gateways into one robust platform for online payment processing. It has partnered with e-wallets, credit/debit card processors, bank apps, etc to provide payment solutions to its merchants and users.

OkePay has created a platform for payment service providers to join their network and integrate their services into the OkePay network. This has enabled OkePay services to offer localized services to several regions and countries. At the moment, OkePay can process transactions in more than 150 currencies.

OkePay offers a unique approach when it comes to business integrations. Every business is different and OkePay tailors its payment solutions to meet the specific needs of both small and large enterprises. Merchants can easily integrate OkePay payment solutions on their websites, mobile apps, and e-commerce platforms, POS and VPOS in order to receive payments via cards, e-wallets, banks, and prepaid vouchers.

**OkeApp**

This app comes with packages for merchants, shoppers, and marketers.

• OkeMerchants: These are vendors who sell goods and services. Payments are processed via OkePay. They offer discounts to OkeMembers and in turn receive full marketing promotions.

• OkePartners: These clients refer clients to the OkeApp platform and receive rewards when their referred partners patronize merchants. They earn a 5% referral commission on transactions made by their referees. This can serve as passive income.

• OkeMembers: These are clients who use OkeApp to enjoy discounts when they purchase goods and services from OkeMerchants.

**READIES**

Perhaps, in a bid to evade taxes, maintain a secret life, or whatever reason; many gamblers choose to hide their identities. RHCO has the perfect solution with READIES; a prepaid payment voucher that enables anonymous online payments. READIES is not only made for gamblers, anyone can use it to protect their privacy when making online payments such as shopping, buying tickets, playing online games, trading cryptocurrencies, etc. It is fast, easy, and secure.

Clients can purchase READIES vouchers from retail outlets or on the READIES website. Merchants, resellers, and partners can also enroll on the website to enjoy the services provided. The onboarding process is fully automated and simple. Partners are required to undergo the KYC process in compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) standards.

At the moment, READIES is accepted in more than 10,000 stores in about 50 countries. This number is expected to grow in the near future.

**Oke Retail**

**Neckermann Direct**

A renowned European retail brand with over 60 years of history; RHCO acquired the brand in 2016. Neckermann has a ‘product information management’ platform where merchants can upload their inventory at a fee. The products are instantly displayed on various retail websites.

The platform incorporates a powerful notification system and inventory management making it easy for a merchant to manage his products and sales. Neckermann receives about 15-20% commissions on sales.

**2% (Two percent)**

This is an international fashion brand that is popular in Asia and Europe. Its parent company “2% WIP group” was acquired by RHCO in 2019. Currently, RHCO has launched 2% as a luxury online retail shop bringing popular fashion brands, cosmetics, health, and fashion accessories to homes across Europe and Asia. The prices are competitive and it also provides worldwide free shipping.

**Fullness Grace International Ltd**

This is an advertising firm established in 2007 in Hong Kong. The company specializes in outdoor advertising using multimedia and other methods. It has a contract with China Railway to advertise products to passengers on trains. It also has shares in Multimedia tech and production companies.

**Fligro Ltd**

Founded in 1953, Fligro is an international company that sells fresh food in over 100 countries around the world. The company sells beef, pork, poultry fish, vegetables, and dairy. Since its acquisition by RHCO, the company has grown in revenue and expansion. Fligro recently signed a partnership with ‘Netherlands Supply Company’ to add tax-free beverages, liquors, and spirits to its product chain across the Asian markets.

**Recent developments**

RHCO has also announced a plan to launch “Okey Media” following its acquisition of a Dutch Media company, “Hitting Media”. Before its acquisition, Hitting Media developed a target-marketing technology that it uses to provide advertisements targeted at the right audience who actually needs the advertised services. Ultimately, this leads to high conversion rates for the benefit of all the parties involved. RHCO plans to harness this technology, combine it with its technology and expand the services to reach more audiences.

The corporation also announced a plan to launch the “Oke Travel Club”. It will be a travel membership club that will offer OkeApp clients huge discounts on vacation packages and general traveling. This is facilitated by the recent partnership deal with the multinational traveling company; Ctrip. So, OkeApp merchants, partners, and members will be able to enjoy up to 50% discount on flight tickets, hotel bookings, car rentals, etc. There will be more than 1 million locations of hotels and resorts, over 200,000 rental shops, and more than 500 airlines to choose from.

In more recent news Readen has also announced that they now have the right to handle the sales and export of Angelo Mermer’s raw onyx marble blocks to China. Such exporting operations have already started, with marble blocks being shipped to China and Italy. ANGELO MERMER operates an onyx marble mine in Manisa, Turkey. Onyx is a rare and exotic stone with stunning patterns and veining in each slab that is not readily available. According to ANGELO MERMER, it’s economically recoverable high grade reserve amounts to 1 million tones and it’s total onyx onyx accounts for 5% of the worlds total onyx reserves. Based on the valuation report by Baker Tilly, as of March 31st 2021, the total investment value of ANGELO MERMER was calculated at 1 billion USD.

**Future Potential**

The Covid -19 pandemic wreaked havoc on the world economy especially in 2020 when several nations locked down social and economic activities to curb the spread of the virus. During this period, the e-commerce business boomed as there was high demand for online services. e-Wallet apps like PayPal, and Skrill received an upsurge in signups, peer-2-peer (P2P) transfers, and overall transactions.

Many companies, universities, and businesses have never looked back as they have integrated online jobs, academic programs, and online payments. This explains the reason why there is a global decline in cash payments and an upsurge in electronic payments. It is estimated that by 2023, digital payments will have a market share of about USD 6.7 trillion; so, there is a great potential for OkePay to become more popular and generate more profits.

With the proliferation of mobile phone apps, online marketplaces, and a large number of traditional businesses establishing an online presence, it only means additional market and expansion for OkePay and OkeApp. RHCO has plans to expand the use of OkeApp to major cities in China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, etc.

The potential of the Oke travel club looks great. In 2021, tourism contributed USD5.8 trillion to the global GDP. It is expected that post-pandemic recovery will be complete and tourism will soon attain its 2019 value of $9.63 trillion. OkeyMedia is estimated to generate huge revenues for the corporation when it is finally launched. The online gaming market size is estimated to grow up to $250 billion by 2025 and READIES is on course to grab a significant share of that market via its e-vouchers.

**Bottom line**

It can easily be inferred that RHCO is grossly undervalued. The group is managed by a visionary team that is poised to steer its products to enviable heights. Its reported net revenue has recorded a Quarter-on-Quarter growth of about 634% making it a Year-on-Year growth of about 161%. By 2024, its revenue is expected to experience exponential growth. It is just a matter of time before the company claims its rightful place in the global equity market."|0.75|4|0|4

t3_wy9wjp|1661522250|pennystocks|Why you should invest in uranium stocks $PEGA|"If for a long time, nuclear energy had this ominous image of “polluting energy,” and because of its waste, minds have quickly evolved, and maybe countries have started to build nuclear plants as it can provide energetical independency. In the long term, this energy will be used more, which is why you might consider investing in uranium stocks.

https://preview.redd.it/fomh0564d2k91.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0d2ac758befcde2f983ed8b89ed42bf3a4f3813

## What are the benefits of nuclear energy?

Nuclear energy protects air quality. Compared to other sources, it is zero-emission clean energy. The United States avoided more than 471 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2020. It is the equivalent of removing 100 million cars from the road and represents more than all other clean energy sources combined. Infrastructure-wise, nuclear is also a great winner. It has a light footprint, and for a 1,000-megawatt atomic facility in the USA that would need a little more than 1 square mile to operate, windfarms require 360 times more land area, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.

Regarding nuclear waste, the WNA claims, “In all countries using nuclear energy, there are well-established procedures for storing, managing and transporting such wastes, funded from electricity users. Wastes are contained and managed, not released. Storage is safe and secure; plans are well in hand for eventual disposal.”

https://preview.redd.it/1e9mvqk4d2k91.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae89174e73e82470437fccc77086ec602e981cb5

According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the high case projection has global nuclear-generating capacity increasing from 392 GWe in 2019 to 475 GWe by 2030, 622 by 2040, and 715 by 2050. Choosing nuclear options can result in several cases, whether it be for environmental or electric freedom. Recently, European countries have suffered from energetic dependency as many countries bought Russia’s resources. [According to the Nuclear Power Association](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide.aspx#:~:text=Nuclear%20power%20capacity%20worldwide%20is,about%2055%20reactors%20under%20construction.), about 440 reactors operate in 32 countries. About 55 plants are currently being constructed in 19 countries, notably China, India, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates. About 100 power reactors with a total gross capacity of approximately 100,000 MWe are on order or planned, and over 300 more are proposed. Currently, most reactors are in Asia, with fast-growing economies and rapidly-rising electricity demand. About 30 countries are considering, planning, or starting nuclear power programs.

## Pegasus Resource is a small cap with tremendous growth potential

Pegasus Resources stock ([PEGA.V](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEGA.V?p=PEGA.V&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) is an exciting play as nuclear power has a unique spot in transitioning from fossil fuels to sustainable energy.Pegasus Resources Inc. is a diversified Junior Canadian Mineral Exploration Company focusing on North America’s uranium, gold, and base metal properties.

Pegasus currently holds four Uranium properties located northeast of the prolific **Athabasca Basin** of northern Saskatchewan:

## About the Athabasca Basin

It's me doinshit. Contrary to the title, I have been doing shit, research.

Can search around for  previous DD I wrote but I'm here to do a refresher on the float calculations. So hold onto your panties, and get some glue ready to sniff because after this it will be solidify in your head that this is the only play.

Theodore aka ""King"" ""Champ"" ""Besty"" ""Zaddddy"" .... the activist. [Filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000089924322029450/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) earlier in the week showed he owns 13.231m shares.

From [https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya) we have the following whales with filings as recent as 8/15 and no later than 8/9

**Vanguard owns**: 9,531,774  - 11%

**Capital World**: 8,369,041 - 9.7%

**Blackr0ck**: 7476,255 - 8.7%

**American Centurry Companies**: 5,950,649 - 6.9%

**Theodore** \- 12,231,360 = 14.41%

Total = **43,559,079**

In total we add all of this up and we have 43.55m shares. Now I go to the latest [10Q](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000141810022000047/avya-20220331.htm) to find the shares outstanding which is 85.837m. So with this information we have float of 85.837m-43.55m =42.337. This is old news the new information is the new CEO's contract:

[The source again is from the SEC this time the 8k.](https://preview.redd.it/zeltfdpm6xj91.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5a0d23f4dd7ab7e410dae581bfff3d9dfaf89b7)

Wall of text but notice that he received a 4million dollar cash bonus which is to be used explicitly to purchase shares of the Company's stock in **open market transactions. You can view his exact offer letter** [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000141810022000075/ex101.htm)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mnlc6isgfxj91.png?width=2802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be1aab41a5ace86b0b441144192577afbc855e52

So the price after the letter $2 then Avaya dumped hard below $1. If Maesrek is the chad I know he his then he secured shares at an average price of $1. If so thats 4million shares reduced from float.

**Given this we can further reduce float like so 42.337m - 4m = 38.337m.**

Now are my assumptions legit? Well Theordore aka the ""GOAT"" agrees. See his comment in the 13g he [filed](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm) this week.

[quote--- \\""based on June 30th 13f filings, very few of Avaya's institutional shareholders have reported reductions in their share holding\\"" ](https://preview.redd.it/40v935gifxj91.png?width=1324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ae4616a906109b37437348300771d5afdaaec9a)

&amp;#x200B;

I also  back up what I say without relying on Theodore aka ""da Gawd"": 10%+ holders of any stock have to file within 2days of any transaction given that we haven’t seen these filings would say float is less than what’s reported. For the two 8% holders they would need to file if that level drops below 5%, which they have not yet. Of the 5 holders who collectively have 50% of shares outstanding 2 of them own around 10%+, and the other &lt;10%+; hence the 42.33m float number. I have show justification for 42.33m - 4m = **38.337**m  float calculation based on the new CEO compensation and stipulations in the contract.

Why does this matter? Well you can read Theo's letter and get a sense of where his mind is at in terms of the shorts.

&amp;#x200B;

**However note that official short interest is 15.24m. So essentially I'm saying** Avaya **is 40% shorted.**  Estimated SI is at 20.35 so probably around 50% shorted tbh:

&amp;#x200B;

Further, this is relatively new as institutions and Theo have been loading in the past 2months, Theodore  aka ""Money Bags McGee"" actually bought 1.8m shares in the last two weeks. The price action is starting to show the lack of liquidity.

We see barcoding

We see wild fluctuations in the CTB

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3sv88wynfxj91.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b28f2a8e762c8f5087eb16455562160186dd4c2c

Average CTB ran from 3% yesterday to 109% today, then ended at 13.51%. CTB max is now at 271.88%  two days ago this was at 6%.

https://preview.redd.it/9r9x5ihqfxj91.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c8771713f512e9fec2b518c6ec29cb3a835392f

&amp;#x200B;

Can also see that shares available basically at 0, yesterday over 2million shares available.

So maybe Theo ""The Oracle"" is right about the synthetic shares and ftds and maybe we are on to something.

https://i.redd.it/0eomp97rfxj91.gif

&amp;#x200B;

Btw here's the [CEO's interview](https://siliconangle.com/2022/08/22/new-ceo-alan-masarek-talks-future-avaya/) about his plans to turnaround AVYA clearly from his compensation letter he has a strong incentive to see the price go Boom Boom.

# Made a mistake in my calculations edited.

what;s the mistake?

https://preview.redd.it/5d4hyxoatyj91.png?width=2764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b07db38a89493a0438f3bac88aa8a11e524715d

PRN according to whalewisdom means shares associated with converitble debt, so once the price goes past a certain point holders can exercise. In Theodores letter he states $3.41 is the strike but they can't convert until Oct 1. These guys hedge so they are the ones getting squeezed rn, they can't convert notes to cover the shorts. lol Sheesh the setup is wild.

https://preview.redd.it/0nicw2bbtyj91.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ae3617bdf4bc4e4497a8278e40c9d68cff41630

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I excluded these guys from the float calculations and included firms that own 5%+ of shares to come to  a lower number around. so around 40% of shares are shorted and possibly if we include the estimated short interest now 50%. So I edited the post to include the correct calculations and will be going back to edit the others.."|0.96|37|0|37
t3_wxozpl|1661460285|pennystocks|Anyone heard of ESE Entertainment (TSXV: ESE)?|"Hey y'all I am back and still doing these tedious DD posts, I know you love to read...

Many of you have heard about e-sports but I was never aware of how large and profitable the industry was (honestly, outside of FortNite my video game knowledge is ZERO). Investcanada states that viewership has increased 8% YOY and that audience size is expected to hit 577million by 2024. They also state that the US and Canadian gaming market are expected to hit 2.8 billion in revenue by 2023. 

ESE Entertainment plans to capitalize on the growing e-sports industry by providing a wide range of services to video game dev teams and to publishers. These services primarily revolve around providing tech infrastructure and fan engagement services. (Think gaming leagues and the tech infrastructure to stream them properly).

But don't listen to some stranger on Reddit...listen to the rich stranger in a sit instead, this interview from Konrad Wasiela (CEO of ESE) on how they monetize e-sports to generate revenue. Starts at 1:35:

# Exogenous Events

Come November, six states hope to join 19 others plus Washington, D.C., and Guam in [legalizing recreational use of cannabis](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/3615374-voters-in-these-states-may-soon-decide-whether-to-legalize-marijuana/).  South Dakota, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and Oklahoma could all have ballot initiatives up for vote in the midterm elections. Should they all pass, half the country will have legalized adult recreational marijuana use at the state level.

Cannabis is slated to be [legalized in Germany](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-cannabis-stocks-could-benefit-from-adult-use-cannabis-legalization-in-germany-11661174672), and the U.S. is looking to [legalize on a federal level](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/08/28355732/sen-booker-claims-being-optimistic-about-federal-marijuana-decriminalization-after-signaling-pos).  Lawmakers state by state are [calling for federal legalization](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/state-lawmakers-across-the-u-s-call-for-federal-marijuana-legalization-and-banking-reform-in-revised-resolution/) now.  This would immediately allow for an uplisting of 💲 K G K G (Kona Gold Beverage Inc.) onto the NYSE.  Additionally, money is set to begin to [flow back in](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/08/28592476/cannabis-focused-etf-will-include-us-multi-state-operators) to cannabis tickers.

&amp;#x200B;

# Financially Healthy

Kona Gold Beverage has already surpassed all of 2021 revenue as the Company focuses on 2022 revenue *more than doubling from the previous year*.  With the expansion westward, and the development of its current distribution partners, the Company will achieve this goal.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Recent Developments

The continued [distribution expansion](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kona-gold-beverage-inc-signs-130000056.html) from Kona Gold has been nothing short of amazing.  Kona Gold's new West Region Territory Manager will be leading and managing the partnership with the California and Nevada distribution partners.  This is a major expansion of their Cannabis energy drink sales beyond the eastern and southern portion of the United States.

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR

Kona Gold Beverage Inc ( 💲 K G K G ) is set to benefit from November state elections on cannabis/hemp legalization.  Further, the company would benefit on U.S. federal legalization.  The company has strong U.S.-based leadership and is headquartered in Florida.  Yet, increasing revenues show that the company does not need to depend on additional legalizations.  On the technicals, Artificial Intelligence yapping 'Buy here', and RSI indicates oversold.  Supports show that a rise in the share price is impending.  Combining the above with the incredible taste, bodily-relaxation achieved, and energy obtained from drinking the healthy beverage (after trying it, I am now a regular/repeat consumer) I don't know what's not to like about **Kona Gold** stock."|0.57|1|0|1

t3_wxjni6|1661447272|pennystocks|Investment Opp: Ghost Kitchens|"Vice calls them “Virtual Restaurants” but they are more commonly known as Ghost Kitchens within the industry. I first heard about them during the peak of the pandemic from this Vice video:

[How Virtual Restaurants Could Become a $1 Trillion Industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru2irhp3yPo)

I was reminded of the ghost Kitchen business model after hearing about a local startup in my home city called COHO Collective Kitchens ($COHO.V). They provide a space for restaurant startups to cook their products and sell via order services like Uber Eats and Door Dash. If you have heard of Mr. Beast Burger or seen the restaurant on delivery apps many of them were ghost kitchens that were operating out of warehouse kitchens just like the ones COHO provides.

The restaurant industry has some of the highest initial costs of any industry which have led many to go out of business - more than 3,300 Canadian restaurants had gone out of business in the past 12 months, and that number was almost 10 times higher in the U.S. ([Source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/impact-of-restaurant-closures-in-canada-identified-by-unified-data-labs-301539251.html))

Thus, if you want to enter into this line of business as a small business owner, you must find creative ways to cut down on costs. One great way to do this is through ghost kitchens. Ghost kitchens like COHO offer enormous advantages over regular kitchens for restaurant owners wanting to break into the industry. Here are just a few compared to a traditional brick &amp; mortar restaurant:

|Ghost kitchens:|Brick &amp; Mortar Restaurants:|
|:-|:-|
|Shaves off months of licensing &amp; permits|Months to get licenses &amp; permits|
|Lower startup cost &amp; risk|High startup costs &amp; risk|
|In-house capital &amp; consulting|Difficult to source capital &amp; consulting|
|Bulk order sharing between cooks|No bulk order sharing|
|Setup for expedited online order service|Setup for in-person service|

The economics for ghost kitchens make sense, as ghost Kitchens like COHO offer their members a cost-effective solution to start and scale their business for relatively low risk. They also make the experience hassle-free by offering their business service connections - such as having access to pre-negotiated deals with large suppliers. And the demand is there – Coho currently has approx. 100 members with another 300 to 400 on a waiting list.

With ghost kitchens on the rise, as Hospitality Technology’s surveys indicate that ghost kitchens are forecasted to reach $71.4B by 2027, I’m excited to see what long-term players like COHO who are poised for sustainable growth will deliver to investors in the future.

t3_wxdzce|1661433303|pennystocks|Pegasus Announces Results of the RadonEx survey on its Pine Channel Uranium Project, Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan $PEGA|"VANCOUVER, BC—August 24, 2022– Pegasus Resources Inc. (TSX-V: PEGA: Frankfurt – OQS2, OTC/Pink Sheet symbol: SLTFF) (the ""Company"" or ""Pegasus"") is pleased to announce that based on the recent radon survey results, in combination with the historical geophysical work, Pegasus is looking to advance its Pine Channel Uranium Project (the ""Project"" or ""Pine Channel""), located in the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan, to the drilling stage.  

The radon survey comprised two grids, Grid A and Grid B, consisting of 461 and 217 radon sampling points. Grid A spans roughly 3km east to west, starting along the shoreline and extending approximately 850m to the south. Grid B is 1300m by 750m and is located to the south of Grid A. 

 GRID A: 

Two linear anomalous radon trends are interpreted on Grid A,  

A NNE to SSW trend and a WNW to ESE trend. Both are interpreted to reflect basement structural features.

GRID B:

There are three ENE-WSW trending anomalous radon trends. The three diminish in intensity toward the WSW. Given that the dominant ice direction in this region parallels these trends, RadonEx interprets that they may be caused by uraniferous boulder trains. Alternatively, they may be due to ENE-WSW basement structures that parallel the nearby Grease River Shear Zone.

""Exciting times for Pegasus investors. The radon survey came back, and we have drill-ready targets!"" stated Chris Timmins, President of Pegasus Resources. ""Pegasus, over the coming weeks, will apply for the necessary permits and consult with the group representing the northern communities and First Nations groups, the Ya’ thi Néné Lands and Resources (YNLR) office, leading up to a winter drill program.""

Pine Channel Uranium Property Highlights:

The Project is prospective for unconformity-related uranium mineralization, with a very shallow depth to the basement from surface of about 60 to 100 metres;

Historical work identified two conductive trends on the Project. One trend is approximately 2.5 km long, defined by both airborne and ground electromagnetic (EM) surveys. The second, a 600-metre-long conductor has not yet been followed up with a ground EM survey(s) or drilling; and

Drilling in 1981 identified anomalous uranium in a hematite-rich fracture within Athabasca sandstone rocks, directly above unconformity in hole PC81-2 with 0.15% U3O8 over 0.15m.

t3_wxd84c|1661431313|pennystocks|SmartMetric Update on Its Global Payments Network Compliant Biometric Credit Card Manufacture|"NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SmartMetric, Inc. (OTCQB: SMME) is pleased to announce that it has been able to address a compliance change required by the global payments network the company is working with for the worldwide release of its biometric credit card.

There are four large global payments networks with two of these four accounting for the vast majority of global credit card transactions. The payments networks are the interconnect medium that connects credit card readers in stores and gas pumps as well as ATMs. For clarification these payments networks do not issue cards themselves but do have their respective brand names on the credit cards that are issued by banks and card issuing institutions.

All credit cards that operate over the payments networks need to be approved of by the payments network before a bank is able to issue the credit card to its customers.

The two largest credit card payments networks are Visa and MasterCard. Card issuers and card manufacturers must gain permission from the card payments networks prior to a card being manufactured and then issued to the public for the card to operate over either of these companies’ payments networks.

SmartMetric has been working with one of the largest global payments networks in order to have its biometric card meet the network's licensing and functional requirements so that its biometric card can then be used by card issuing banks around the world.

One of the most recent issues that SmartMetric faced was the need to change its EMV chip used in its card. The licensing and approving network required that SmartMetric adopt a different EMV credit card chip for its product approval. The EMV chip is the credit card chip is the square chip found on the top surface of what is called chip credit cards. As an aside, there are more than 10 billion1 chip cards issued globally.

The required change of our EMV chip created a supply chain issue since the acquisition of a replacement was being quoted for delivery into mid to late 2023. Luckily for SmartMetric, our supplier is now quoting approximately 10 weeks for supply of this critical component for our biometric credit card. Just like other areas of the electronics parts world, credit card payments chips are in huge demand and have long lead times for supply.

While no one is pleased to suffer supply chain delays we are extremely pleased with our supportive chip supplier and are excited with us moving ever closer to the release of our payments network-conforming new biometric credit card, said today SmartMetric’s President and CEO, Chaya Hendrick.

Bringing a brand-new type of credit card into existence that meets the approval and licensing requirements of the credit card industry is no small feat. However, we are excited with the incredible prospects for the company as we move forward with our amazing next generation credit card with built in biometric fingerprint security, said Chaya Hendrick.

SmartMetric’s Biometric card addresses the multibillion existing chip-based credit and debit card market. Figures published by EMVCo reveal that by year end of 2020, 10.8 billion EMV® chip cards have been issued by financial institutions and were in global circulation – a massive increase of nearly 1 billion credit and debit EMV® cards compared to the previous twelve months."|0.83|4|0|4

We saw it break down through $1 early in the morning, but then it eventually went back up above that crucial level. Not gonna lie, I thought we were in for a bloodbath after Tuesday's great performance, but boy was I wrong.

**Please read my previous DD on AVYA, it gives us a basis to build the argument that AVYA is highly likely to short squeeze and is also undervalued!**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One important thing we can take away from yesterday is the barcoding we saw at that $1 level. This establishes a strong support point that will be harder to break.

&amp;#x200B;

[We saw barcoding at around the $1 level, providing strong support.](https://preview.redd.it/95l4juodguj91.png?width=1696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e293ec22db7c12af916c87990d6b02a1535844b)

We should see trading between the $1 and $2 range, since there's still a gap that needs to be filled at $2.

&amp;#x200B;

[We are on our way to filling the gap down from $2.](https://preview.redd.it/m8g5fyteguj91.png?width=1416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82e8f8419361fbc53f87efca04c6243b4833158d)

The last two days have been really positive for AVYA. On Tuesday, we went up 38% on 114M volume. According to Webull, free float is **68.99M**. This means that we almost traded 2x float. That's shows that the stock has increasing momentum to the upside. Yesterday, we saw an initial decrease during the morning of around 10%, but we rebounded midday and exploded to $1.20-1.30 levels on high volume! Just another positive to the stock movement. We almost traded our entire float yesterday, so we can see that volume is picking up!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0r63dbofguj91.png?width=329&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a0b31bf45f1f4225221db9b9d6215b8bc0bcd24

Now another point about free float: I've noticed that free float has been going down over the past few days. I can recall seeing it at around 72-73M a few days ago, so it seems that shares are being bought back! This has to be a big positive for the stock's movement.

&amp;#x200B;

Short interest has increased by \~5% since yesterday's post, and has increased from \~17% just a few days ago. Shorts are shorting more and more, we just gotta fight back.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7ezcifdhguj91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d741aeb620ff3646b8baeed546afd3549ec729c1

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at OBV (On Balance Volume), we see something incredible.

&amp;#x200B;

[A sharp spike in OBV!](https://preview.redd.it/5by6qzmiguj91.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=229ecfebee04df78881753e63783038d968931cd)

Higher OBV means that there is positive volume pressure that is being forced onto the stock. A spike like that shows that we have full momentum going up. Just thought I'd share that with you.

&amp;#x200B;

RSI is also nowhere near overbought territory, so we could see some more exciting price action in the coming few days!

&amp;#x200B;

[Current RSI is at 49.47, right around the midpoint of the RSI range.](https://preview.redd.it/ui3aq33kguj91.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=968eb0b1b7ebc9da984ae470ec1025992022153a)

&amp;#x200B;

Just an update on social metrics, we are beginning to see more and more people talk about Avaya. I have seen a lot more reddit posts about AVYA along with the small but growing subreddit with the same name.

We have also seen Stocktwits activity pick up. From the last time I reported, we went from 1705 daily messages to 4788! The number of watchers has also gone up substantially, from 2534 to 3671.

&amp;#x200B;

[Explosion in message volume and number of people watching the stock.](https://preview.redd.it/vdxwl5bmguj91.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cecbfee2ad47cf5a87946a4850e359b423f55134)

Anyways, yesterday was a pretty good day for AVYA considering what happened at open. Remember, this is a play that **may take some time** to develop, AND **WE ARE STILL REALLY EARLY**, but I personally see a lot of room for it to run.

t3_wxayhj|1661424665|pennystocks|How Small Business Holding Companies can be a VC alternative for the average investor|"SBHCs (like $BOMN, and $MBHCF) are a public holding companies created to facilitate the financing and support of small businesses. SBHCs are intended to be public companies and, somewhat like a mutual fund, can serve as a collective investment vehicle to invest in other companies. 

However, while mutual funds have to invest at least 85% of their assets in publicly traded securities (stocks and bonds by companies listed on the stock market), an SBHC invests in and owns a large number of small, private (not public) businesses. Think of them as a public venture capital company or mutual fund for small businesses. **This allows the average person, not just wealthy investors, to invest in something that resembles a VC fund**.

Furthermore, SBHC also help bring resources like capital and expertise usually exclusive to public companies down to local small businesses, increase their chances to survive, grow and better serve their communities.

How do SBHC's work? well, they gather acquire a group of SMEs together into an entity large enough to be a public company. So instead of investing in an individual small company, investors invest in the public SBHC, which then invests in many small businesses at one time. Helping to spreads the risk, providing liquidity, and facilitating the recouping of the original investment plus a healthy return.

That is not to say that there are no risks involved in investing in SBHCs, potential investors have to a few key factors to ascertain whether the SBHC is worth investing in. Firstly, they must ensure that the holding company has a diverse and profitable collection of SMEs in their portfolio. Additionally, investors must also looks at whether the SBHC has a solid history of financial performance and whether the company is taking on a large amount of debt in order to fund their acquisitions. Lastly, investors should also look at the overall growth plan of the SBHC, as well as their acquisition plan in order to ascertain if the company has the potential to continue growing."|1.0|3|0|3

t3_wwvt42|1661377685|pennystocks|More DD for $PRTY|"Hey everyone, I don't know how many of you have a position in $PRTY, but I'm sure some of you do. I thought I'd make a quick bull case even though I've already seen a few over the last few days.

CNN Business released an article with comments from the vice president of merchandising. The company is already seeing increased customer traffic while people stock up on supplies early. If you follow the stock, you probably already know that they're carrying out a massive seasonal hiring campaign this year. If you've read the most recent earnings call, you know that the CEO mentioned that they are flush with inventory to meet demand and that he is very confident with the quality of that inventory. Late shipments around this time last year were a problem for them. This year is different from what I'm hearing and seeing. There will also be more Halloween City pop-up locations this year. Expect that trend to continue in subsequent years.

A helium shortage was a major headwind for the company early this year, but the company took steps to ensure that they can consistently source it in the future for a reasonable price. After all, balloons are a large part of their retail business year-round. Business conditions, in general, were unfavorable for the company over the past two years. They've had a string of bad luck even outside of the pandemic. That explains much of the deep drop in stock price. Regardless, they've done a fantastic job managing all of the transitory headwinds while maintaining the strength of their brand.

The company is working hard to pivot with the opening of close to one hundred next-gen stores this year alone. They currently sell on Amazon and continue to improve their own online platform. I'm not sure who needs to hear this, but they actually make most of the products that are on display in their stores. They also sell the products wholesale to other retail chains (some major players on that list). The debt on the balance sheet will become less and less of a problem as the company continues to roll out its new strategies over the coming quarters. It's all gotten the attention of some institutional buyers recently.

Lastly, I want to say that there is a growing community of people who are genuinely invested in the company right now at the near rock-bottom valuation. I'm not here to spread false information about an imminent short squeeze (only \~12% SI) like this is some pump and dump. You won't see any rocket or moon emojis from me. I don't refer to myself as an ""ape."" Stocks like $BBBY and $APRN have been roaring this week despite the fact that they don't even turn a profit. The meme stock frenzy has convinced some people that the only way to make money in the stock market is to buy one minute and sell the next. Party City Holdco is a profitable company that is undervalued where it currently sits. I'm confident the market will organically reassess the true value of the stock in the near future, leading to analyst upgrades and, ultimately, a much higher market cap than the $250 million current market cap. Let's stay realistic, though. I've seen people on so much hopium that they expect this thing to rocket 2000% or more. I'm not expecting that, but there is some real upside potential imo. Any American here and probably some outside the U.S understand the power of this brand. I'm confident it's not going away any time soon.

I encourage everyone to do their own due diligence before investing in anything.

t3_wwtpp4|1661372556|pennystocks|Performance Shipping is ready again|"Performance shipping (Ticker symbol $PSHG) just announced a deal to purchase a 7th ship. This time delving into the refined petroleum market where rates are in “excess of $40k” a day. This will bring them to 6 ships operating in the spot market, making a killer profit on each ship. They also have a ship charted on a two year contract, also at a significant profit, albeit less than the spot market profitability.

Part of Performance Shippings business plan is to raise capital for ship acquisitions. They have had 3 recent offerings, which caused turmoil in the stock price. Before the most recent offering, there was a substantial climb in price surrounding the $3.7 million profit they posted and the time charter contract they signed. The most recent offering was at $0.45, and the stock oversold to the low $0.30 range, even dipping slightly under. 

The last two offerings were direct offerings to institutional buyers. It would be incredibly reasonable to assume a recovery to the $0.45 price in the short term. In the bigger picture, they are massively undervalued. They did raise money, but the shares were also trading under cash value before this latest ship acquisition. On top of that they are wildly profitable as they operate in the spot market which has gone and is still going crazy right now. Compared to equity, the share price is about 3.5x undervalued if all warrants exercise. Currently, it’s about 6x undervalued compared to equity per share.

Performing in the spot market makes them subject to volatility, but with the shipping market entering a major upwards trend, they have started to reap the benefits of that volatility. Based on available figures for aframax spot rates, and the addition of another tanker ship earlier in the quarter, they should at least double their profits from last quarter. 

Depending of the financing terms for the ship announced today, they could potentially still have enough cash on hand to pay dividends this quarter. That remains to be seen, but at the very least we’re looking at sequential quarters of revenue and profit growth. 

This offering seems to have provided another buying opportunity on a massively undervalued company that is at the turning point of massive profit generation. 

They have a very simple balance sheet and a very informative, yet slightly outdated investor presentation available on their website. If you’re willing to do some dd, you’ll see this is a pretty good entry point into this sector."|0.81|9|0|9

Excerpts from article below for a shorter read 


***Can you give an overview of Livento Group Inc. What does the company do?***

Livento group is a company that specializes in finding companies or projects that are coming from established industries with growth potential. We are not looking for new venues or startups.

Livento started five years ago when we launched a small firm with asset management support. After a year and a half, we had established our first opportunity and developed a software called Elisee, a portfolio system used for asset managers to track their investments. With going to OTC, we are in the next step of our journey which next steps are going through OTCQB towards one of major stock exchanges.

We successfully finished several real estate development projects and increased the assets in our company by acquiring new businesses such as BOXO Productions, which mainly focus are movies. Boxo has a team of professionals with an impressive track record in the Hollywood industry.

***What is the expected outlook on BOXO Productions, revenues, and how consistently do you see these revenues for BOXO in the future?***

With the first film in our pipeline now complete, we will be announcing new movies soon. The six movies we promised this year are finally coming to fruition. I never use a hundred percent, but our success rate is impressive; I'm 99% confident of what the revenue will look like and who ultimately delivers it to our customers.

*** The chance to get involved in Euro Dot***

In Euro Dot, we have two companies that we will take on board to create a larger IPO and offer part of company to external investor so we can then boost these companies or make another acquisition.e. What would be the circumstances necessary for completing that purchase, and what would be the assumed benefits. 

For EURO Dot we plan its focus on Europe logistics sector and trucks with LNG, CNG and other alternative engine types. Initial companies joining the holding have combined revenues over $40 million and further acquisitions during upcoming years should boost its value.

***Two questions on your authorized shares coming from Jeremiah and also Scott. So, Jeremiah says you mentioned before that you would reduce the authorized shares by a minimum of 300 million. Do you have any updates on that, or has it increased?
 And Scott says also there's been chatter about some authorized share reduction. Will it be finalized soon?***

Yes. As I said, it will happen. The paperwork is just in the process of being completed

Reasons can vary, but a lot of people are looking for opportunities with companies that are advocates for social justice, or are active in contributing to global warming and environmental solutions, or perhaps provide equal advancement opportunities to employees of all stripes.

Today we’ll take a look at one such opportunity, broken down by the Canadian digital media company Jayconomics. Jayconomics creates an array of videos designed to inform and educate potential investors with the goal of demystifying and democratizing the financial landscape for viewers. In the video discussed here, Jayconomics discusses in-depth the opportunity with Aduro Clean Technologies (CSE: ACT) (OTCQB: ACTHF) (FSE: 9D50). Aduro has developed a patented, hyper-efficient, low cost, water-based system for recycling plastics called Hydrochemolytic™ Technology (HCT). The full video can be found here, but we’ll break it down into parts for you as well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E)

Part 1 - The Problem: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E&amp;t=98s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E&amp;t=98s)

In this first clip, Jayconomics discusses the overarching problem - plastic waste has gotten out of control, plastic production is growing, and current recycling technologies are not able to adequately meet the challenge due to financial and technical constraints.

Part 2 - The Solution: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E&amp;t=230s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E&amp;t=230s)

Here the host discusses Aduro’s technology and its advantages, both financially and technologically. The HCT platform is highly scalable with relatively low capital requirements, is able to recycle almost any kind of plastic waste (compared to the 20% of all plastics currently considered recyclable), and results in an 85-90% efficiency rate compared to 50-60% from current methods.

Part 3 - The Risks + Timeline: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E&amp;t=324s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E&amp;t=324s)

In this segment Jayconomics covers Aduro’s timeline to full commercialization, along with the risks inherent in this stage of corporate development. He focuses on the many steps the company has taken to de-risk the investment, including third-party validation of the HCT platform and its capabilities, as well as the current construction of pilot projects designed to prove the system at larger scales.

Part 4 - The Balance Sheet: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E&amp;t=449s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E&amp;t=449s)

Jayconomics discusses Aduro’s balance sheet and their upcoming funding needs prior to commercialization of HCT technology. He notes an approximately $3 million is needed to complete the pilot projects, which the company plans to cover with warrants, government grants, and other non-dilutive financing methods. Aduro anticipates generating revenues almost immediately upon completion of the pilot projects.

Part 5 - Aduro Approach: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E&amp;t=511s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E&amp;t=511s)

In this section, the focus is on Aduro’s approach to building its business. Rather than promoting the stock and engaging in successive rounds of financing supposedly designed to fund overly aggressive and unrealistic expansion plans and promises, Aduro is sticking to a much more incremental approach. Develop and prove the technology, partner wisely, underpromise and over deliver.

Part 6 - Key Differentiators: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E&amp;t=603s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E&amp;t=603s)

Here the many unique properties of HCT technology are discussed. The platform requires a very small capital investment to set up and can be operated on anywhere from a hyperlocal small scale to a large regional scale. HCT operates at a much lower temperature than existing systems, and is capable of dealing with impurities and a broad array of plastic feedstock types - two issues that greatly limit current recycling capabilities. The technology is proven at smaller scales, has been third party verified, and is in the process of being proven at much larger scales.

Part 7 - Final Points: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E&amp;t=746s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS80nipn26E&amp;t=746s)

In conclusion, Jayconomics summarizes the case for Aduro Clean Technologies as a fairly derisked, environmentally positive, emergent technology in an area of great need. There is a significant amount of insider ownership, and the company incentivizes executives with performance-based pay to ensure the team is completely aligned with shareholder interests. With a market cap in the $33 million neighbourhood and the technology alone worth up to $50 million even in an emergency fire sale, there is a huge amount of upside with less risk than many microcap growth stocks."|0.88|6|0|6

**TSX-V: RHT - OTC: RQHTF - WKN: A2AJTB**  
**Overview**  
Reliq Health is a rapidly growing global telemedicine company that provides innovative Virtual Care solutions to the multi-billion dollar Healthcare market. Reliq’s proprietary iUGO Care platform supports Remote Patient Monitoring, Telemedicine, Chronic Care Management and Behavioural Health Integration.

  
**Reliq‘s Solution**

  
Reliq’s iUGO Care platform allows clinicians to provide a wide range of virtual / remote heallthcare services to their at risk patients. With iUGO Care, clinicians receive automated alerts that enable early interventions, preventing costly hospital admissions and ER visits. The average clinical practice can generate new revenue of over $372 USD per patient per month in payments from CMS by deploying  
iUGO Care. Hospital admissions are reduced by over 90% in chronic disease patients using iUGO Care, and the average cost to the healthcare system is reduced by over 80%. Market Need US healthcare costs exceeded $4.1 Trillion in 2020. Chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure and COPD account for over 75% of healthcare spending or 18% of US GDP, as these patients frequently develop complications that lead to costly hospitalizations. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) have recently transitioned from fee for service to value-based payments so healthcare providers are now compensated based on patient health outcomes, with significant financial penalties for preventable patient hospital admissions and ER visits. 

**How they make Money**

Reliq's target users are the more than 37 Million Medicare/Medicaid patients and 44 Million privately insured patients. Reliq has a large number of contracts with Clinics and Doctors to provide monitoring at prices averaging at $50 per patient per month. Reliq's margin per patient is 75%. Doctors providing the in home monitoring can charge over $372 per patient so having patients monitored is financially in their interest. 

**Rapid Growth.** 

Over the last year as the company has been able to put patients on to the system we have seen revenues significantly increase while expenses as a loss have decreased. This has been slowed somewhat due to the Pandemic slowing integration and also impacting billings as patients who qualify for home monitoring must not be receiving home care or hospitalization in the same month as billed (The goal is to keep them out of the system). Now that the big waves seem to be behind us this impact is greatly mitigated. Below is a chart of the company's trajectory over the last year along with two projections for the up coming financial reports out on October 28th, 2022 and November 28th, 2022. As you can see the company should post no loss on the next financial and start putting money in the bank on all reports going forward. I will also note the Q3 significant hit on earnings was due to options being redeemed significantly increasing the on book expenses. A problem that will be much less of an issue going forward as with the company being cash positive they will not be diluting further as they clear existing options and warrants off their books.

**Contracts**

Reliq has a massive stock pile of contracts they are working to realize on the system going forward. The company adds to the contract total on a regular basis and continually adds additional revenue sources including the addition of Drug Trials and Hospice Care to the billable Medicare and Medicaid codes that is the bulk of their business. Since the last financial report they company has added the following list of contract announcements. Now keep in mind, this isn't like your cell phone and it takes significant coordination to realize these contracts on the service including ensuring the facilities are using compatible software and individual patient meetings to provide equipment and teach them to use it. These are just the recent contracts in 2022. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yfqrytmn0ij91.png?width=760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b75168137b01284af3d3089476b8b6a9fab2b3c

**Additional notable contracts pulled from the MD&amp;A (Dec 31, 2021)** include Data Soft Logic (DSL) to provide iUGO Care to DSL’s existing and new clients. Data Soft Logic currently has over 600 home health and hospice care agency clients who work with more than 1,000 primary care physicians to provide care to over 500,000 Medicare and Medicaid patients. Reliq expects to begin onboarding DSL’s patients in Q2 Calendar Year 2022 and to ramp up to adding over 50,000 new patients per year each year beginning in 2023, at an estimated revenue of $60 per patient per month. (Company Announced uploading of Data Soft began in June 2022.) 

Reliq has signed an agreement with Cognizant to leverage Cognizant’s Care Management resources for future deployments of Reliq’s iUGO Care software to large scale clients. Cognizant provides services to 300+ health systems and over 347,000 care providers who together provide care to over 200 million lives globally. The agreement with Cognizant will allow Reliq to scale to new levels and provide even the largest healthcare organizations with confidence that the Company can meet the needs of their patient populations, no matter the size, allowing Reliq to access new opportunities to provide virtual care to much larger patient populations both within the US and globally.  

Signed contracts with 39 new US primary care physician practices and 10 other healthcare organizations in specialties including hospice care, nephrology, orthopedics, long term care, cardiology and care management. 

**Revenue Projections.** 

Recently Reliq announced that the company is on track to have 100k patients onboarded to the system by calendar year end and 200k patients on the system by July 2023. This will give the company a conservative run rate of $40M USD a year in January and $80M USD as of their fiscal year end in June. To fully appreciate that growth they only pulled in 6.6m over the last 4 quarters. The company expects to post 40M in revenues in calendar year 2022. 

Any way you stack it, they are showing phenomenal growth. On a conservative multiple, the company is worth far more than it is currently trading at and by June, 2023 I would expect it to be trading close to 10x the current valuation. On an average S&amp;P ratio of 16x the company forward looking at year end should be about 640M market cap or about 6.4X what it is at now. By July 2023 that would be 12.8x. At even half of that, you can triple you investment by early 2023. 

A few things to consider, due to this being a medical play it is virtually recession proof. The rapid growth is now locked in and only mitigating factors are the speed in which they can provide the service. Their relationship with Cognizant will enable them to rapidly onboard large clients if one requests the rapid roll out. 

Long term, Reliq will be a take over target. With Amazon entering into the medical services arena, them, along with some big players like Cognizant and TDOC will inevitably acquire the company in the next couple years. These big companies look for highly profitable companies with rapid growth to provide revenues to the organizations giving their shareholders value. This likely will not occur until Reliq hits a market cap over 4 billion as they have to justify the acquisitions however that said. The rapid growth the company is projecting should make the time-frame relatively short. A really good example of what a take over could look like for Reliq you only have to look at the Livongo/TDOC deal.

**Conclusion**

For me this is a buy, every day of the week but you should do some due diligence. The stock could still dip from where it is and on a technical chart review it could bottom around 0.45 cents Canadian. The stock is heavily shorted with close to 4M shares short on last update on August 15th ( 3,828,545 ). The stock hit 1.33 as the year high so getting back there should be fairly easy. This is a set and forget stock. They have news almost weekly and are at an inflection point transitioning from cash burn to profit. As they add clients to the service monthly the overall financial picture will just get better. Company has plans to use the profit to expand their service team to add even more patients, share buy backs and uplisting to the Nasdaq to maximize the US market penetration. 

There is no way to relay all of the major developments this company has had over the last year or so. I will say it is being watched closely by several funds so it will move quickly when it gets going. Yesterday Bruce Campbell mentioned it again in his past picks. It is worth taking a couple minutes to watch this clip. He recognizes that the company is ready to break. Just needs to get the year end financial out to prove the bottom line. I personally would not wait until then to start a position.

**Supply/Demand Outlook**

**Current Demand**: About 440 reactors with a combined capacity of about 390 GWe require some 74,000 tonnes of uranium oxide concentrate containing about 62,500 tonnes of uranium (U) from mines (or the equivalent from stockpiles or secondary sources) each year.

**Current Supply**: Mines in 2020 supplied some 56,287 tonnes of uranium oxide concentrate (U3O8), containing 47,731 to 74% of the utilities' annual requirements ( [World Uranium Mining](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production.aspx)).

*The IEA World Energy Outlook predicts a 52% increase in electricity demand from 2020 to 2040, with a 75% increase predicted from 2020 to 2050.*

*There is increasing recognition that nuclear power, with its clean emissions profile, reliable and secure baseload characteristics and low, Levelized cost, has a vital role in achieving decarbonization goals.*(Cameco.com)

**This factoid is fascinating, also from Cameco**;

*Utility customers do not come to the market right before they need to load uranium into their reactors. To operate a reactor that could run for more than 60 years, natural uranium and the downstream services must be purchased years in advance, allowing time for several processing steps before it arrives at the power plant as a finished fuel bundle.*

Of particular interest for investors is the renewed interest in Uranium, which is in no small measure due to recent comments made by billionaires such as Elon Musk and the investment activities of others in next-generation nuclear power, such as Bill Gates. Musk twittered the critical nature of nuclear to national security, and Gates, Bezos et al. have invested in next-generation atomic startups.

Pegasus CEO and President Charles Desjardin stated, *""We feel the global uranium market should continue to build strength as the push for green energy alternatives accelerate. As we build our diversified uranium portfolio, we continue evaluating uranium assets in Canada and the United States. Given the current geopolitical climate, uranium demand should continue to accelerate.""*

Pegasus is a developing story with good properties in an age of renewed interest and the need for sustainable electricity generation. Nuclear’s time has likely come, and the Company as the new kid on the block finds itself betwixt and between. Previous work has shown the potential in a premier U308 area.

**Price for Share and Current Market Cap**

War in Ukraine and ramped-up global warming/climate concerns make a case for owning modest –for now--PEGA—at a CDN$0.06 and market cap of CDN$5.42 million, potential growth or perhaps takeover candidate.

It seems Pegasus is in a suitable political climate and has properties in a skookum area, globally speaking."|1.0|3|0|3

t3_wvchh6|1661221238|pennystocks|$GEGI stock news|"GEGI Stock News

Originally founded as a pet food manufacturer, GEGI shared a new business plan with its shareholders highlighting its pivot towards the lucrative autonomous technology sector. To facilitate this change, GEGI is currently exploring acquisition and license agreement opportunities with companies operating in this industry. As autonomous technology has been constantly advancing over the past 10 years, GEGI’s CEO Braden Jones is confident “many industries can be disrupted if these technologies were applied to them”.  With this in mind, GEGI is putting together an experienced team of advisors and partners to introduce the company to potential acquisition or licensing agreement candidates. 

As part of this business change, GEGI launched a new website to provide more information regarding its new business for its shareholders and the company plans on updating this website regularly as the company’s business develops. On top of that, GEGI promised its shareholders more updates once its change of control is finalized with the OTC Markets which could happen very soon since GEGI has already filed the required paperwork. Considering this sector’s potential, GEGI could be one of the best cheap stocks to buy now ahead of these catalysts.

According to its newly launched website, GEGI appears focused on autonomous transportation, autonomous security, and AI. With the transportation industry looking for revolutionary solutions, many companies are focused on developing autonomous cars and trucks. By pivoting its business focus towards autonomous solutions for this industry, GEGI could be poised to capitalize on this untapped and underserved market if it is able to develop technologies that solve the current logistics and transportation problems.

Developing autonomous solutions in the security sector could not only significantly improve current security solutions but offer them at a much lower cost. Adding these solutions to current security teams will help increase efficiencies and lower costs substantially. Due to this new business direction, it is pivotal for GEGI to have robust AI software which is why GEGI intends to license or acquire AI and machine learning autonomous solutions to leverage them in many applications. Given the scale of this business plan, GEGI is emerging as one of the cheap stocks to buy now as there is is a real need for this technology and the market is ready for the innovative solutions which GEGI may develop.

On that note, many investors are speculating GEGI could be ready to announce an acquisition with the Australian AI and digital learning company – Apiom Inc. which is also known as Go1. Go1 is a provider of curated online learning materials and tools for businesses using playlists containing content from several publishers. Through its platform, Go1 offers AI based analytics to see how well the content is used and offer personalized materials as well.

Speculations of a possible acquisition began when some investors noticed that the Australian company filed a form D using the same address as GEGI. Acquiring this AI system could position GEGI for success as it pursues this new business direction and if these theories prove true then GEGI could be one of the best cheap stocks to buy now ahead of this potential acquisition announcement.

However, Apiom Inc. has already raised $200 million through a Series D and the company’s CEO Andrew Barnes believes Go1 could be valued at more than $1 billion. While GEGI does not have the funds to finalize this deal, the company is now able to use its shares to support its growth efforts.

In the past the company had a court order preventing it from issuing shares but GEGI was able to dissolve this after a private investor along with the company stepped in to negotiate with a former debtor to settle their dispute. Now, GEGI could issue shares to close an acquisition with a company with AI assets like Apiom.

This seems in line with the company’s new direction under its CEO and Chairman – Braden Jones – who recently joined GEGI’s management. Jones owned and operated a trucking and transportation company but has also worked in the logistics and transportation industry for over 15 years. Since he was appointed, Jones has been “assembling a highly-qualified team of advisors and partners that are making introductions to companies that could be good candidates for acquisition or licensing agreements”. With this in mind, many investors are bullish that GEGI’s upcoming announcement will help accelerate the company’s growth.  

*Updated August 22nd

Looking to position itself as a leader in its new business direction upon finalizing a merger, GEGI added Kevin Damoa as a strategic advisor to the board. This appointment allows GEGI to capitalize on Damoa’s vast experience in aviation and aerospace, electrification, e-mobility, as well as defense industries. Through this experience, Damoa held leadership roles at early startups and well-established major companies like SpaceX, Northrop Grumman, Romeo Power Technology, and XOS Trucks. With this in mind, Damoa’s previous role as vice president at XOS has led to speculations among investors that XOS could be on track to merge with GEGI considering their similar business direction. While these talks remain speculation, GEGI could be one of the best cheap stocks to buy now if the company merges with a company like XOS. 

Considering Damoa’s experience and networks in the industry, adding someone of his caliber could assist GEGI in exploring opportunities for mergers, acquisitions, or technology licensing. In this way, GEGI could accelerate its plans to start operating in its new lucrative business direction. Given that the autonomous vehicles market is witnessing increased interest at the moment, GEGI could be one of the cheap stocks to buy now before this industry explodes in the future. 

In addition to Damoa’s appointment, GEGI added two former consultants from KPMG and PWC to ensure compliance with the market. These new consultants will be paid in stock as a compensation for their services which is a bullish sign of their trust in the company’s direction in the future. In light of this, GEGI could be one of the cheap stocks to buy now in anticipation of the roll out of its upcoming catalysts.

Meanwhile, GEGI has been more active with shareholders lately and shared several updates with shareholders which show the potential of the company’s upcoming deal. With this in mind, Jones recently announced that he will communicate directly with shareholders through GEGI’s Twitter account and promised to share developments soon. As the upcoming merger or acquisition appears to be around the corner, GEGI could be one of cheap stocks to buy now before exploding on more updates.

Media Sentiment

@SpacTraderInTra is bullish on the management’s vision for the company in the long-term.

@SalsTradingOTC is confident GEGI could break $.01 upon announcing its much anticipated venture.

Technical Analysis

￼

Currently, GEGI is still one of the cheap stocks to buy now as it trades at $.0069. The stock shows resistance at its 52-week high of .0087 and has supports near .0066, .0042, .0031, and .0023.Given that many investors are bullish on the company’s new business direction, GEGI stock climbed by as much as 420% since announcing its future plans. 

GEGI is currently consolidating following its run to $.0087 and retested its support multiple times. As the stock appears to be rebounding, GEGI could retest its resistance soon especially if the company shares new updates. With this in mind, bullish investors could enter into a starter position at the current PPS given that the RSI cooled significantly which could signal a run near the resistance this week.

￼

With GEGI reaching a new 52-week high recently, accumulation is witnessing a slight downtick due to investors taking profit and the MACD is bearish. The RSI cooled off from 90 to 57 which could signal another run soon as the RSI has reset. As is, GEGI has an AS of 2.2 billion, an OS of 1.9 billion and its float is believed to be near its held at DTC of 1 billion.

GEGI Stock Forecast

With the company entering the autonomous technology sector, GEGI could be one of the cheap stocks to buy now as this industry is expected to grow to more than $2 trillion by 2030. With this in mind, GEGI could be close to announcing its first venture into this industry as the company promised to share more news once its change of control process is completed with the OTC Markets.

In the meantime, GEGI is preparing to announce its venture into this growing industry and appointed Damoa as a consultant to capitalize on his extensive experience and connections within the industry. Considering Damoa’s roles with several well-established companies like SpaceX, his appointment could help GEGI  secure a profitable merger or acquisition in the autonomous vehicles market. GEGI also added consultants who previously worked at leading firms like KPMG and PWC to ensure its compliance with the market. Through these appointments, GEGI appears to be close to announcing its venture into the autonomous vehicles industry. 

GEGI has also been more active with shareholders lately with the CEO communicating directly to shareholders through the company’s Twitter account. With Jones promising to share developments with shareholders soon, investors are speculating news regarding a merger or acquisition could be as soon as this week. In light of this, GEGI could be one of the best cheap stocks to buy now in anticipation of its announcement."|0.67|2|0|2

**Why I am writing this -** [Cathy Wood](https://investorplace.com/2022/08/cathie-wood-is-doubling-down-on-ginkgo-bioworks-dna-stock/) has just ""doubled-down"" on her position and $DNA has had some great runs recently!  


**What is Ginkgo Bioworks?**  
Ginkgo Bioworks is a company that aims to bring together the best of traditional plant breeding and modern biotechnology to create new varieties of plants with unique traits. Their most well-known product is ginkgo biloba, which is used as a supplement and a flavoring agent in foods, beverages, and medicines. The company also creates other varieties of ginkgo trees and plants, such as ginkgo trees used to extract ginkgo flavonoids for use as supplements and medicines, and ginkgo plants used to create transgenic crops that produce ginkgo flavonoids for use as supplements and medicines. Transgenic crops produce crops that have been altered or modified using biotechnology, such as the use of genetic engineering  


**Why am I bullish?**  
Biotechnology is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. Ginkgo Bioworks is a leader in the field and is one of the few companies that can actually manufacture complex biological compounds. This opens up a range of opportunities for the company, including the ability to create better drugs, better vaccines, and better animal feed. This has the potential to change the world for the better, but only if more people invest in the company.  


This company is incredibly forward-thinking &amp; I am bullish on their future!

t3_wuttki|1661175278|pennystocks|Two Undervalued OTC Companies To Take Notice Of $RHCO $PHBI|"Let’s talk Pink Sheet stocks. And then a couple of good candidates. Including one that is actually one of the largest stocks in the world.

https://preview.redd.it/laz4wqrcp9j91.png?width=404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c1c9a8d223b12e5521e8c2a53ddd4267c717196

Pink sheets are listings for stocks that trade over the counter (OTC) rather than on a major U.S. stock exchange. Many pink sheet listings are stock shares in companies that cannot meet the requirements for listing on a major U.S. stock exchange like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

**Salient Points:**

•	Low-priced penny stocks. Mainly.

•	Trade for less than $5 a share

•	Tend to be highly speculative

•	Companies may choose for lower listing cost

•	Avoids more stringent regulatory listing requirements

•	Roughly 11,000 listings.

•	Two primary platforms for the listing of over-the-counter securities, OTCBB and pink sheets

Check out Investopedia, so I don't have to simply list stuff.

Examples:

**Readen Holding Corp (OTC Pink: RHCO)** is a listed venture capital corporation with over 30 years of activity. The Company has a long history of engaging in the retail trade. More recently, it has been active in the Fintech, Online Payment and E-commerce industries, a vast potential growth sector es-North America. RHCO has subsidiaries and liaison offices in Europe, Asia and New Zealand.

Readen's strengths are acquiring distressed assets, selling the weak parts, and growing the best assets. The free App is available in all the usual places. The Company is aggressively pursuing an uplisting to the OTCQB. It hopes to conclude this year.

https://preview.redd.it/ju1q31idp9j91.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4426f4492de46ea7fab07a60d3d7ff428baf1687

RHCO reported an increase in Revenue of 634.42% compared to the quarter ending December 2021, which is also a year-over-year increase of 161.39%. After two previous quarters of a minor loss, the Company has recorded a nominal profit, and its Net Assets saw a rise of 1.99% compared to last year's end.

Here is a link to what can only be described as historically impressive quarterly results. While the concept is simple, there is no predicting what businesses will be added to the mix. Given the provenance of the executives, the risk/reward scale seems to tilt to the latter.

Readen is an aggressive trader with a 52-week range of USD$0.02 to USD0.21. Not a bad run for a pinkie.

**Pharmagreen Biotech, Inc., (OTCQB: PHBI)** (""Pharmagreen"" or the ""Company"") provides the highest quality starter plantlets utilizing a proprietary tissue culture process, ""Chibafreen,"" to licensed cannabis cultivators and CBD / CBG hemp farmers.

Peter Wojcik, CEO of Pharmagreen, stated, ""We are laser-focused on getting revenues started with the lowest CAPEX as soon as possible. We plan to create products based on the whole plant and fungi, thereby maximizing the beneficial and therapeutic effects, the same approach we use with cannabis. Once the micro cannabis license gets approved, we will add cannabis-based products, both stand-alone and combined with other ingredients, to target specific ailments and help people prevent illness first.""

Unique companies are always more interesting to write about. PHBI is such an endeavour and encompasses legs in the plant market, therapeutics and therapies and growth logistics that, by their nature, improve the revenues and lower the cost of customers. The word 'Proxy' once again rears its potentially good head.

Shopping for stocks near their 52-week lows can be very profitable if you understand WHY they are near their lows. Is it bad earnings, bad results in a clinical trial (in the case of biotechs), a business plan pivot that will take time to prove out, etc? Here are a few that are promising, IMO.

Biofrontera ($BFRI) - Beaten up Biotech specializing in skin diseases. Stock trading LESS than Cash on Han per share.  A decline in revenue quarter to quarter was due to higher sales in the previous quarter to beat a scheduled price increase. (Read higher revenues going forward). Biotech conference schedule in the Fall is very busy.  --   $1.15

Jupiter Wellness ($JUPW) looks like is in a Bottom Reversal (Check the chart, chartists!). Small pharma company with OTC products with products in HUGE markets.  Importantly, the company did over $3 Million in revenue in the Second Quarter and higher revenues are expected going forward.  Female libido product, treatment for hair loss, skin conditions   --- $0.66

Marpai, Inc. ($MRAI)  also bounced off its 52-week low last week and is trending up.   The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) and works with self-insured employers who provide healthcare benefits to their employees.  ---  $0.85

Mawson Infrastructure ($MIGI) -- Interesting that this Bitcoin miner looks to be the only miner that has NOT gone up since the rebound in Bitcoin. The last operational update showed more than 40,000 crypto machines up and running. Earnings call announced for today.  Judging by how many machines they had last year vs. this year, revenues should be up over 500%.   ---- $0.73"|0.83|12|0|12

Tweet ""14C not happening anytime soon or even a possibility at this time as we leave our options open. We will wait before we cancel it or let it expire , as we proceed to complete our funding for our solar project to build a 1GW production plant  $SNPW #SOLAR""

Also,there is no possibility for dilution.

OK, there is so much going on globally with this company. I will summarize some very important points for Sun Pacific Power Corp and National Mechanical Group Corp, subsidies of SNPW:

- Fox-ess, subsidy of Tsingshan, a Global Fortune 500 company (#238), also the world's largest nickel producer, is involved with SNPW, as stated in the 10Q ""Sun Pacific Power Corp. has entered into an agreement with Fox-ess, a global leader in the development of inverter and energy storage solutions as a wholesale distributer for North and South America and Australia. Sun Pacific Power Corp. has also entered into an agreement with a South Asian solar manufacturer to act as a original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) for Sun Pacific Solar Panels and associated products."" FYI the Father runs Tsingshan and he has his son running Fox-ess so chances are Fox-ess will do fairly well... 

- Patented solar panels, also stated in 10Q
"" On September 19, 2019, the United States Patent and Trademark Office published patent US 2019 288 139 A1 for the Frame-Less Encapsulated Photo-Voltaic (PV) Solar Power Panel Supporting Solar Cell Modules Encapsulated Within Optically-Transparent Epoxy-Resin Material Coating a Phenolic Resin Support Sheet issued to National Mechanical Group Corp. Originally designed for application in the solar bus shelters operated by Street Smart Outdoor Corp, as a glassless solar panel, the Company has developed a patent protected product and process for creating solar panels that can be integrated directly into the design of products as a molded, weather resistant plastic. The Company will begin work developing a business plan for expanding on either manufacturing or licensing of the technology in the future."" 

- They just tweeted their solar panel manufacturing plant layout again today. They are a solar panel OEM, with patented glass free technology, as mentioned. The 'Inflation Reduction Act' was signed last week and, if you read the specification of the act, 100% credit for manufacturing solar panels - through to 2029. So basically solar panel OEMs are like money printers ffs

- The funding of the 1Gw manufacturing plant has not been confirmed, but the 8K release May 20, 2022 stated 
""On May 20, 2022 announce Sun Pacific Holding Corp. Subsidiary Sun Pacific Power Corp and PT. IDN SOLAR TECH sign agreement to help build a solar panel facility to manufacture up to 1GW of solar panels per year, leading annual revenues to $450 million"" 

The MC right now is roughly $15M, yep $15M. It is SLIGHTLY UNDERVALUED, in my opinion. I loaded up. They have great partnerships, patents, government SUPPORT, government connections, manufacturing facility and the CEO is a badass who, imo, wants loyal SNPW investors to get rich."|0.6|1|0|1

- $AGSS (formerly $HRAA) is a custodial shell that was obtained by David Lazar (CEO of both Custodian Ventures and Activist Investing) in July 2020
- The shell company was sold to Ameriguard Security Services Inc. in September 2021 for $450,000
- By April 2022, the company’s name and ticker were changed to Ameriguard Security Services Inc. and $AGSS respectively
- The merger process is currently in its final stages and the quiet period is expected to end any time

MERGER TARGET
- Ameriguard Security Services Inc. has an estimated value of $100 million or more based on its projected $25 million in annual revenue solely from government contracts, 15% compounded annual growth rate of government contract revenue since 2016, and $308 million in total revenue from government contracts (these numbers do NOT include private and commercial revenue streams!)
- Ameriguard’s board of directors include [General Russel Honoré](https://generalhonore.com/) (led the Capitol security review for the January 6, 2021 attack and Joint Task Force Katrina in 2005) and [Douglas Anderson](https://wallstreetcap.com/about) (CEO of Wall Street Capital Partners and has helped numerous companies with Nasdaq uplisting as well as capital raises)

SHELL INFORMATION, VALUATION, AND SHARE STRUCTURE (AS OF 8/21/2022)
- Share price: $1.58
- Market cap: $4.33 million
- Outstanding shares: 2.74 million
- Float: 2.05 million
- No debt
- Carries a $10 million net operating loss (for a future tax write-off)
- SEC reporter

UPCOMING CATALYSTS
- Form 8-K finalizing the Ameriguard Security Services Inc. merger into the $AGSS shell (signaling the end of the quiet period)
- OTC Markets shell status removal
- Nasdaq uplist
- Company updates

TL;DR
- $AGSS is a clean $4.33 million market cap shell merging with an estimated $100+ million private security company
- The merger target has growing revenue from government contracts and a stacked board of directors
- $AGSS can realistically uplist to the Nasdaq upon a successful merger with Ameriguard Security Services Inc."|0.64|3|0|3

Current pain medication causes people to get addicted and abuse the meds. That's when ENSC comes in with their clinical stage drug PF614, currently in phase 2 development with fast track designation and shortenend 5052b approval pathway.

ENSC claims PF614 is designed as an abuse-protected agent with trypsin-activated abuse protection.

Pfizer paid 3.6 billion for King Pharmaceuticals, and this for the drug/pain killer Embeda. Embeda was first approved on August 13, 2009, but was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in March 2011, due to testing that found stability concerns in the manufacturing process.

I think ENSC is the only pharma company which tries to tackle the opioid crisis, no other competitors on the market right now with the same tech. If their drug gets approved, it could open a huge market oppurtunity.

Price action of the stock is very strange, is hopefully at rock bottom right now at 0.42 USD, company at 15 million market cap.

If they get bought out for at least 3.6 billion, what could the share price be long term? Also Zacks gave a recent price target of 12 USD. Take a look at their updated investor presentation on their website to get convinced.

Fundamental Research released a new research report on GCM Mining Corp. TSX: GCM / OTCQX: TPRFF - formerly Gran Colombia Gold 

The report focuses on the possibility of an acquisition; here are some highlights. 

GCM is trading at a 60% discount to junior gold producers, and remains one of the very few dividend-paying junior gold miners. Its forward yield of 5.4% is 85% higher than the average of senior producers. Forward EV/EBITDA is 1.0x vs the comparables average of 3.4x.

Shareholders of both GCM and Aris Gold (TSX: ARIS) are meeting next month to vote on the proposed acquisition of Aris by GCM. 

The analyst at Fundamental Research believe GCM shareholders are likely to approve the deal due to the attractive valuation metrics.

Finally, Fundamental Research’s analysts are expecting a rally in gold prices as the Fed is likely to take a less hawkish stance in its meeting next month due to weaker economic activities and GDP growth and as inflation has started to taper.

Check out the full report: [https://www.researchfrc.com/gcm-mining-corp-formerly-gran-colombia-gold-tsx-gcm-otcqx-tprff-accretive-acquisition-to-drive-valuation-higher-2/](https://www.researchfrc.com/gcm-mining-corp-formerly-gran-colombia-gold-tsx-gcm-otcqx-tprff-accretive-acquisition-to-drive-valuation-higher-2/)

The Company's fleet consists of four tanker vessels and one dry bulk vessel with an aggregate cargo carrying capacity of approximately 617,014 dwt tons.

We’ll actually their fleet currently consists of 1 tanker vessel and 1 one dry bulk vessel. One was recently delivered, see news release: [August 11th PR](https://www.unitedmaritime.gr/media/62f4fe6293732.pdf)

They were supposed to receive delivery of the other 3 tankers the first and second week of August. This has not met the delivery expectations, as such the stock has been beaten down by short sellers and inpatient hodlers.

These tankers are expected to fetch a daily rate of $50,000, expanded to a full year with 4 operational tankers averaging 6 days a week and this results in a gross revenue of $62,400,000 - FYI their current market cap is only $14.62 million. Couple this with only 8.86 million shares outstanding, and this stock could RUN and in a hurry.

The other 3 tankers should be delivered any day now, given the original estimate of first and second week of August. 

Additionally, they just completed an offering on July 26th that raised $26 million valued at $3.25/share. It’s currently trading at $1.50/share. See news release: [July 26th PR](https://www.unitedmaritime.gr/media/62dfea8591dc4.pdf) I believe it’s only a matter of when, not if, this stock will pop.

**Share Structure/Financials**

For an emerging tech company, Fandifi has strong fundamentals. On the balance sheet side, the company has $4M in total assets with $2.5M in cash and cash equivalents. The company also has no debt, which leads Fandifi to have a clean balance sheet. In the three months ended April 30, the company’s most significant expenses were the platform and development costs which represented $319k.

About the share structure, the company has 82M shares outstanding, with 25% held by management, board &amp; key investors. Fandifi also has 35M warrants which could bring $10M if they are all exercised (min. price: $0.10 and max. price: $0.50), and 8.5M options representing $2.1M in cash (min. price: $0.09 and max price: $0.50). Fully diluted, there are 126M shares. If the company manages to increase its market cap and share price, it could enable Fandifi to exercise its warrants and options and have a healthy dilution. During the year 2022, no trades on the market have been made by insiders.

Because the company has an emerging business, the ongoing concern written in the financial statement explains the company still couldn’t finance day-to-day activities through operations. The company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the successful results from the development and monetization of the Company’s Entertainment Platform for sports and esports superfan engagement and the related mobile applications and its ability to attain profitable licensing and advertising-based operations and generate funds from and/or raise equity capital or borrowings sufficient to meet current and future obligations, all of which are uncertain. If, as mentioned above, the company plans to cover the operating costs over the next twelve months from related parties, the exercise of stock options, and warrants, the company could also get funds generated from private placements.

**Share Movement**

Fandifi’s stock price is currently worth $0.12 for a $9.5M market cap. If the stock went to a 52-week high of $0.25 on April 4, it went on a continuous downtrend to reach its 52-week low of $0.075 on June 30.

About stock performance, it just gave a positive return on investment if you invested a month ago (43.7%). If you bought it other times, the stock gave -45% Year-over-Year and -28% in the last three months.

https://preview.redd.it/4t2j0jh80pi91.png?width=1974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9310d2448568ecfc6109a408e1ed9b71b1e2f7f3

[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-RHCO/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-RHCO/)

The technical side indicates the stock is currently a BUY, with 10 Buy, 11 Neutral, and five sell signals. RSI and RSI-based MA data indicate the stock is neither overbought nor oversold (30 and under, 70 and above) as these data represent 53 and 52. Its Moving Averages show the stock is in a downtrend with its Simple MA (200) worth $0.145and above its Simple MA (50) worth $0.105.

t3_wsddeu|1660913841|pennystocks|POET (Nasdaq). Overview DD. Worth looking.|"* POET's business: developing and producing photonic chips (optoelectronic integrated circuits or optoelectronic semiconductors). These are chips needed in sensing markets such as Lidar, biosensing and defense but also in datacenters (transceivers), articifial intelligence (machine learning) and telecom 5G. The use of photons (light) is way more efficient and way faster to guide signals/data than electrons used in conventional chips. So photonic chips can guide more signals, more data, at the same time. Also when compared to electrical chips, photonic chips have greater power efficiency and generate significantly low heat during operation, thus resulting in an increased power efficiency. So photonic chips are receiving increasing attention worldwide.
* The world is changing. Smart cities, cars communicating, non-invasive biomarkers sensing in smartwatches and phones, 5G connectivity, data storage in clouds,.... The volume of information going across the internet continues to expand. Data rates and requirements will continue to grow, insatiable global appetite. We really need more and we need faster and better chips than electronic chips. The desire for photonic chips is increasing.
* The total global photonics market is projected to reach $1033720 million by 2028, from $661770 million in 2021, at a CAGR of 6.5% during 2022-2028 and the total global Photonic Integrated Circuit market (so only the photonic chips here) is projected to reach $9400 million by 2032, from $1300 million in 2022, at a CAGR of 21.5% during 2022-2032.
* Other companies (Intel,...) are already developing photonic chips and we already use these chips, but these chips are all made by hand-work. Components are individually placed and connected by hand, and they face a lot of technical issues, performance issues and manufacturability issues. These chips have problems with for example conducting light signals (absorption, loss, reflection...), have high assembly costs and they still consume a lot of energy. Current photonic chips are not scalable for applications needing 100's of millions to billions of units per year.
* So... POET's chips are adressing these problems. The most recent iteration of this company came around 2015, when Dr. Suresh Venkatesan joined the company as CEO. He was formerly the CTO of GlobalFoundries. POET pivoted from the previous Gallium Arsenide based technology to the development of their superior and current technology: the Optical Interposer, which is able to utilize not only Gallium Arsenide but can use the highest performance components from different material sets (Si, InP, SiON, GaN). The Optical Interposer technology is used to develop all types of chips, used for artificial intelligence/machine learning and in datacenters. POET right now is also doing a feasibility study on biosensing (they are in talks with worlds largest wearable and mobile phone manufacturers in China and Korea) and POET has been addressed by many companies for Lidar and defense applications. So POET has the solution that addresses all the issues that others are facing. After 5 years and $60 million spent, the platform is ready for commercialization. Other companies on the OFC (conference) called it ""a piece of art"". POET has unlocked the bottleneck in packaging optoelectronic semiconductors. POET's chips can be manufactured using conventional ""CMOS"" equipment (devices also used to manufacture electronic chips so there is no need for new, innovative high tech equipment). Thanks to this unique wafer-scale assembly technique, POET can make 100's of photonic chips at a time (&gt;400 chips on a single wafer). Also, compared to competitors who align every component by hand and piece by piece, POET simply makes ONE, single, ""hybrid"" chip, in no time, with all the best components needed just ""flip-chipped"" into one, single chip. POET's chips play nicely with many other best-in-breed modulators, lasers, and so on. It can even incorporate a Lightwave Logic Polymer modulator when they are ready. So everyone else is still doing hand work with limitations to specific components, and POET is developing top-notch products in high-volume. POET chips include EVERYTHING: Si photonics modulator integration, hermetic seal, micro optics assembly, flip-chip passive integration, vertical mirrors, external cavity gratings and passive athermal waveguides. They can use all types of lasers (EML, DML) and no isolator is needed. POET got chips that adresses RF, thermal as well as the optical connectivity (bit technical here).
* ===&gt; POET's chips have the lowest cost (-40% vs. competition), lower power consumption (-40% vs. competition), zero alignment (vs. 8 competition), no degradation in performance (great eye-margins, athermal waveguides, low coupling loss...), only 6 components into one single chip (vs. &gt;30 competition) and POET's solution for high bandwidth communications/ artificial intelligence machine learning (POET is already contracted with Celestial Ai) even has a 75% cost reduction compared to other conventional solutions. Moreso, POET's chips have the smallest size in the industry (75% smaller than competition). They can put 4 chips where competition can put 1, so multiplying performance by 4 in the same space. In sum, an inflationary world, POET’s chips are deflationary. POET's chips reduce costs for every party involved: capex, bill of materials, assembly/labor, testing, energy, and so on.
* 18 Patents + 21 Patents Pending
* Production of initial chips begins end of this year. These initial products are 100G, 200G, 400G (this year) and 800G (next year) chips used in datacenters. These chips will be the first cash cow for the company because of the high demand for these speeds.
* POET will release chips with speeds 1.6T/s, 3.2T/s and 6.4T/s, while other big names such as Intel and others are still looking for these solutions. POET is the only hybrid, integrated, one-chip solution for higher speeds. Also the Lightbar (used for artificial intelligence) beta samples are underway (production next year).
* POET easily can ramp up production because of the joint venture with SANAN Optoelectronics Co, China's biggest LED chip maker, and SANAN bought all the equipment. This team has already 40 employees. The joint venture may go public on the STAR board in the future. If demand exceeds, POET will start a new joint venture probably in Northern America. Also, POET has a collaboration with SilTerra, a Malaysia-based semiconductor company that runs a world-class 8” silicon wafer foundry. Note: the largest market is in China.
* Revenue: projected to be approximately 130 million USD revenue between now and 3 years (end 2025), based on just initial 10 customers and first initial products (!!!), while the customer base is increasing literally month after month and more and faster engines are being developed. Some of these 10 customers might already increase their position to 100M revenue per year if things go well (dixit POET). This in turn would catapult POET to the top of all those P/E lists that are automatically generated by bots, due to its low share price and high earnings. Not to forget that these revenues will gradually INCREASE to MORE than 1 billion per year by 2028.
* Near-term gross margin 40% and long-term gross margin 50% and 25%+ EBITDA margins.
* POET's senior management is senior ex-MACOM and senior ex-GlobalFoundries. The staff and board is increasing with world class talent from for example Columbia University, Arista and GlobalFoundries.
* POET has co-founded SHINE (Singapore Hybrid-Integrated Next generation micro-Electronics center). It is a strong team formed by top-notch professors across the world from NUS, NTU, University of California Berkeley and Northeastern University, A\*STAR Institute of Microelectronics (IME) and DSO National Laboratories (DSO). Other members of the Consortium currently include Advanced Micro Foundry (AMF), Applied Materials, Cadence Design System, Continental Automotive and SOITEC.
* Mentioned as a major player in most market reports, such as Yole.
* Critical acclaim on world leading conferences such as CIOE but also OFC and IEEE and is being compared to the big names. They even got to show the interposer technology on an electronic semiconductor conference (the 2022 IEEE Symposium on VLSI Technology &amp; Circuits) because POET is able to create photonic chips at volumes comparable to electronic semiconductors by using the same equipment.
* Shares outstanding: 36.7 million, fully diluted shares: 44.6 million, warrants: 2.9 million, management options: 5 million.
* POET is headquartered in Canada.
* 2.5% owned by institutions (increasing!).
* Cash (as of June 30, 2022) $13.8 million, burn rate $1.25 million/month, 8-month runway, no debt.
* POET CEO exercised out of the money warrants into the company this month -&gt; bullish sign.
* Risks: world war 3, supply chain issues, pandemic, competition (but they are out of reach because POET's chips based on the optical interposer technology is THE ONLY chip scale integrated solution for modulated lasers extending the applicability of these devices into the terabyte era, competition is way behind).
* Scheduled: AGM october 2022; ECOC september 22, 2022: Suresh will join the Delphi room, after Intel's presentation and before Imec.
* Lots of info posted on the POET Subreddit, Agoracom forum and on POET's website mainly under ""news"" (new website is under construction!).
* Zacks target $13.75/share, now $3.38/share.
* POET as a non-rev (not for long) tech company is extremely oversold because fear of recession and war. But the risk-reward is heavily skewed towards reward. Nothing large has to be invented anymore. The Optical Interposer technology is already here."|0.9|49|0|49

It creates revenue with ads when people are entering the websites or watching the YouTube videos. (Little problem here is that the ads segments generated 88% of the revenue of all the company)**

**-esports and entertainment; they own Luminosity Gaming. An esports team owning Vancouver Titans and Seattle Surge. In total with all the influencer playing for them, they are the esports team with the most views of all with 100 million fans around the world. They also organize events for gamer with once 55000 persons at one place.**

**-subscriptions; inside the websites they own, they offer subscriptions. One example of this is: the sims resources which is one of the largest female gamer audience websites with 188 thousand people paying a subscription of 4 dollars a month. In total they have 258 thousand paid subscribers in all their apps.**

**Moat; I think they are starting to have a pretty big moat as they have 300 millions monthly active viewers. They also have the biggest esports team in Luminosity gaming in the number of fans. To compare, Reddit has 330 millions people in its platform.**

**Growth; as it is growing, the company will be receiving more and more ads sales in its ad inventory from other companies trying to market their products with EG. Plus, the facts that the gaming industries is growing at an enormous rate. I think that it should grow at a double-digit rate even if it stops acquiring other websites. So, if they continue to acquire other websites, it should exponentiate the growth.** 

**Now the exciting parts😊! They are trying to create a gaming social network call ‘projects GG’ which if it works (I think so because they have really big influencer like example XQC that could influence people to use it plus the 300 millions monthly viewers) would propels the company to new heights to the level of reddit and discord. They only need to mix all its website together correctly and it could be incredible.**

**Income statements; Their business is cyclical so they will earn way more in the last quarter as there is black Friday and Christmas. But in the 1 quarter they will earn way less as people buy less things so there are less people trying to buy ads.**

**Their revenue have grown from 72 million in 2020 to 167 millions in 2021, a 130% growth. But they are for now losing money after paying all the salaries and all the other expenses.They lost 50 millions last years which is big but they are planning on being ebitda positive in q4.**

**Balance sheet; they have 14 millions in cash which is only 4% of their market cap. So they would need to fastly become profitable because it could put them out of business or force them to issue more shares which would dilute any investors. They have 10 millions $ in debt which is not too much. They also are already issuing many shares to help them finance their acquisition. From 2020 to 2021, they added more than 30% of outstandings shares passing from 104 millions shares to 133 millions shares.** 

**Cash Flow; They are Cash Flow negative with 23 million$ lost in 2021.**

**Management; The CEO is Adrian Montgomery. He served as president and CEO of Aquilini Sports and Entertainment, one of Canada’s premier sports and Entertainment organizations. He is the former president of Tuckamore Capital Management, a conglomerate with over 700 million of annual revenue, and the former CEO of QM Environmental, one of Canada’s largest contracting companies.**

**Some important metrics;** 

**They don’t have P/e ratio because they are not positive for now**

**p/b= 1,28**

**p/s= 1,47**

**Market Cap= 323 millions** 

**Enterprise Value= 320 millions**

**Enterprise Value/Revenue= 1,62**

**Shares outstandings= 150 millions**

**Float= 125 millions** 

**% held by insiders= 14.52%**

**% held by institutions= 11.25%**

**The risks;** 

**-if the esports gaming engagement start fading away, the business model would be impact.** 

**-88% of there revenue is relying on advertisers to buy ads on there websites so if there are less advertisers trying to promote their products, the revenue would be affected.**

**-in a recession, advertisers could spend less to try to promote their websites because they would have less money to play with and it is the same for the person buying subscription which would ultimately create less revenue.**

**-they could buy a bad company which could make them lose money.**

**-A ads blocker could supress a big amount of the money generated by the ads.**

**-They don’t have much data to analyze as they are relatively new.**

**-They issues millions of shares to finance their activities which dilute us investors.**

**-They have an history of net losses and there is nothing to prove they will be in the positive eventually.**

**Catalyst of why the price will go up**

**It is position at the front of one of the industries growing the fastest. And so I think the market is afraid of all the diluting they are doing and so when they will stop diluting this much the company + when they start being ebitda positives, I think the market will jump on it. This is without talking about Project GG where they will try to create a social network for gaming combining their 300 millions monthly people seeing the content.** 

**The future value;**

**In many years, I am seeing a valuation like Reddit right now. As I think that as the company mature, they will just be better at monetizing all their websites + if they successfully create project GG, they will look a lot like reddit but with additionally a subscription model.**

**What are your thoughts about the company? Again if you have any tip about how I could have made this DD better, it would be a pleasure to listen to your tip.**

**Disclosure; I don’t own a share in the company.**"|1.0|3|0|3

A massive field with a comparatively small market cap. Several risks are present, however, the world class potential of the basin coupled with the small company makes it worth looking into. Here is an article discussing the stock that might serve as a good DD starting point.

  

""Every so often, an undervalued play comes along, due to its potential (and likelihood thereof), be it in any industry. We believe Invictus Energy is one of those plays. IVCTF (OTCMKTS) is an independent, Australian oil and gas exploration company with rights to a 1.952 million acre region encompassing part of northern Zimbabwe. To preface, this is a wild-cat play, which generally carries a high level of risk due to potential infrastructural, geological, and political challenges. This said, Invictus’s prospects on these three fronts appear relatively positive thus far. Their principal asset is within the Cabora Bassa basin, a large frontier rift basin in northern Zimbabwe (80% interest). The “Mukuyu-1” well, the first drill test site is planned to commence in August 2022. 

Original analysis (based on seismic data, aeromagnetic data, etc.) estimated 8.2 Tcf of natural gas + 247 million barrels of conventional gas condensate. Already, this was a massive target (particularly relative to the size of the company). This estimate was updated by ERCE (an independent third-party agency specializing in petroleum reservoir evaluation) to 20 Tcf + 845 million barrels of conventional gas condensate on July 5th (“gross mean recoverable conventional potential \[unrisked basis\]”), representing a 2.7x increase, a clear indication of the potential, not only in the currently targeted prospect, but Invictus’s entire acreage.""

The market for these franchises are huge and may include subscription video on demand providers (like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc.)

Good day everyone,

Grom Social Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: GROM) the social media company just for kids, and a creator of media content for animated films and televisions series.

Current price **$.485/share (+ 6%** at market close 8-17-22)

GROM shares recorded their second day of strong gains in the Wednesday session with a 6% advance. Trading volume was 448K shares.

GROM is currently trading less than half its book value and has closed the past five sessions above it SMA20 and SMA50 averages indicating a trend and a potential swing toward the SMA200 of $1.27/share.

I anticipate revenues may grow for GROM in H2 2022 and I want to take a specific look at developments at all the company’s segments for growth initiatives.

**Grom Social** – has generated marginal revenues from subscriptions and advertising thus far. The total digital ad spend on kids has grown from $600M in 2016 to over $1.68B in 2021. A kids website safety watchdog group, welivesecurity.com rates **Grom Social as one of the top four best websites for children**. GROM is currently reworking the Grom Social website with an updated release scheduled for Q4 2022.

**Top Draw Animation** – currently the top revenue generator for the company. In addition to the $1.4M in contracts awarded to them in June, they’ve just landed a $1.3M contract to begin later in Q3 2022. The addition of Russell Hicks and Jared Wolfson to the TDA C-Suite gives Top Draw access to new Hollywood animation business.

**Grom Educational Services** – already a revenue generator for the company that offers NetSpective Web filtering solutions, which helps safeguard students K-12 from harmful content and inappropriate sites when on campus or when using school-issued devices or Wi-Fi. The segment also offers a newly updated Digital Citizen Licensing (DCL) course for students that schools rely on to stay in compliance with the CIPA act which ties e-rate funding to schools and districts that demonstrate their students have been taught the importance of digital safety.

**Curiosity Ink Media (CIM)** – not a current revenue generator but has the greatest potential. Subscription video on demand providers like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc. are scrambling for new subscribers and they have largely missed out on the Preschooler and animation opportunity. CIM has at least eight multimedia content franchises currently in development by a team of creative people with big name hits in their resumes like SpongeBob SquarePants, Dora the Explorer, and Scooby Doo that can be marketed and collaboratively developed by any of those subscription video companies looking for subscribers and wanting to address a market segment they’ve missed.

Santa.com could be a significant revenue producer fir CIM in H2 2022 as its ecommerce storefront begins operating this holiday season. The company has licensing rights to sell the Cats vs Pickles plush toys this season as well as many other holiday gifts and needs. CIM has enlisted marketing professionals including All Court Interactive to drive traffic to the site.

CIM has collaborated with Dynamite Entertainment, a publisher of books and comics, to start exposure to their Thunderous and The Legion of Forgettable Supervillains IP franchises and these books are currently on store shelves. Dynamite will also publish holiday books that CIM has in the works. Books and comics are often the incubators for a hit franchise.

**It only takes one or two hit franchises to create the fortunes of a creative content company given the long list of downstream revenues from a hit.** Can GROM produce a hit franchise? I’m not going to list the resumes of the GROM team here, you can see that on the company website, but the **team has a lot of experience at several children’s media content companies like Disney and Cartoon Network. Noticeably, the team has several members with extensive tenure at Nickelodeon.**

Grom Social (GROM) Has Turned a Corner and is Starting to Generate Higher Revenues that Will Ramp Through 2023

Potential technical bounce toward the 200 DMA at $1.31/share.

Good day everyone,

Grom Social Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: GROM) the social media company just for kids, and a creator of media content for animated films and televisions series.

**Current price $.45/share (at market close 8-16-22)**

Initiating coverage of GROM and a look at the current operations of the company. I feel that GROM is a tremendous value currently and will generate potential gains near-term.

Darren Marks, CEO [issued a letter to stakeholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grom-social-enterprises-chief-executive-120000428.html)

on July 27th with an update on GROM operations and a view toward the company’s potential. I urge you all to read it.

**If you are new to our group, GROM operates four distinct segments:**

**Grom Social** is a web destination for children under 13 and one of the top children’s websites. The company is rolling out an upgraded version with a new look in Q4 this year.

**Grom Educational Services** offers NetSpective Web filtering solutions, which helps safeguard students K-12 from harmful content and inappropriate sites. This segment could generate $1M in 2022 revenues.

**Top Draw Animation** has a studio in the Philippines with over 400 artists creating animation content to programmers. This segment has recently begun an effort to provide their services in the Hollywood market. Annual revenues at Top Draw Could be $6-8M in 2022.

**Curiosity Ink Media (CIM),** a company GROM bought 80% of one year ago, remains the best bet to transform the company into a generator of significant revenues and net income. CIM has spent the past year building their team and developing their IP portfolio of creative content for children.

The creative projects CIM is developing sound exciting, and they are being developed by world-class talent with a proven resume of success. Titles such as Laugh on Lorb, Heston of the Apes, Mr. Zip, Thunderous, and The Legion of Forgettable Supervillains are being developed into multi-platform franchises. The market for these franchises is huge and may include subscription video on demand providers (like **Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc.**), many of which are realizing the opportunity that original content for preschoolers and animation represents.

CIM may likely record its initial revenues in Q-4 this year with their santa.com website. It's a virtual North Pole with an e-commerce shop where consumers can shop for all their holiday needs. This year the site will feature products from the popular Cats-vs-Pickles franchise.

**Recent developments at GROM:**

The Legion of Forgettable Supervillains, a CIM creative franchise, made its debut as a graphic novel in comic bookstores on Wednesday, July 27, prior to its wider release wherever books are sold, that began Tuesday, August 9th. The first in a series of planned releases, The Legion of Forgettable Supervillains centers around a group of failed superheroes who inadvertently find greater success and acclaim in villainy.

Thunderous, another CIM franchise with a recently released graphic novel, will take center stage at the 2022 Montana Book Festival taking place in Missoula, September 15-18. Thunderous is a graphic novel about a modern Native American teenager’s journey to understand and appreciate her family’s rich heritage, and first appeared on bookshelves in late April.

Both graphic novels mentioned above have reached the consumer market through GROM’s collaboration with publisher Dynamite Entertainment. Dynamite is a top tier company that primarily publishes adaptations of franchises from other media including top authors with big name creative franchises.

The WHO (World Health Organization) is monitoring MPV closely, given that cases have been reported in multiple countries and case numbers are increasing. In Nigeria, there has been an ongoing outbreak since 2017, according to the Harvard School of Public Health.  In 2Q22, one death was reported in Nigeria. The International Health Regulations Emergency Committee met regarding the multi-country monkey pox outbreak on June 23, 2022. Cases have been reported in about 50 countries, with the majority (over 85%) reported in Europe and about 11% in North America. Moreover, AEMD believes that actual case numbers might be under-reported, as the disease and symptoms are not well-known by diagnosing physicians at this point.

Importantly, the Hemopurifier has demonstrated effectiveness against monkey pox. In 2008, AEMD commissioned Battelle Memorial Institute to run a monkey pox virus (MPV) in vitro study. Results of that study demonstrated that high concentrations of MPV (approximately 35 thousand cpu/ml) were rapidly depleted from cell culture fluids that were circulated through the Hemopurifier. Within 20 hours, the Hemopurifier had removed nearly all (98%) of infectious MPV.

Specifically, the data indicated that the Hemopurifier removed 44% of infectious MPV in the first hour of testing, 82% after six hours, and 98% after 20 hours. The studies were conducted in triplicate and data verification was provided by real-time polymerase chain reaction.

t3_wqznch|1660769136|pennystocks|The DD on $VRM and why it’s undervalued.|"I am bullish on Vroom ($VRM) for a variety of reasons.

The first is on the basis that is trading about 60% below its fair market value/book value ($3.59) for their outstanding shares based on cash and cash equivalents after debt. The Q2 earnings forecast reiterated a balance of $500M in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2022. So point one is that I believe it is fundamentally undervalued just based on what they have in assets and cash after debt.

They are still going to burn through cash this year, but VRMs realignment plan just based on Q2 earnings suggests that it is working as they went from a $450M loss to a $100M loss which is what I anticipated for their most recent earnings report. This is significant because when compared to Carvana who still hemorrhaged about $450M in Q2 after a similar loss of $500M in Q1 is quite the improvement by comparison for Vroom for loss reduction. I believe their push towards profitability will continue to improve and I look forward to seeing Q3 earnings.

The used car market should be consistent for this year and next on the basis that car manufacturers still aren't manufacturing as much and thus demand for used cars will remain elevated. Considering used cars are still cheaper then new (albeit used car prices are insanely high), I would propose that with inflation concerns, most consumers would lean more towards purchasing used cars.

The average price for a used car is running about $30,000 and average price has gone up about 12% from the beginning of the year. The used car demand is likely to stay up as new cars are still dealing with supply chain issues for new parts. The average new car price is about $47,000 according to most recent articles (Consumer Reports, Car and Driver). The new car shortage is likely to last in 2024 according to car dealerships and industry analysts (GM Authority).

Vroom's management seems to have their collective stuff together and they aren't sugar coating where they are at. I can appreciate the transparency as they are not providing false hope, but their providing results and execution of the realignment plan. Vroom’s revenue estimate this year by my calculations should be about $1.5B to $2B. Its yearend forecast for cash and cash equivalents is $500M in liquidity. My thesis started as undervalued fundamentally and I still believe that to be true. I would put a $4.00 price target by December, 2022 and $5 to $10 by end of 2023 assuming no dilution. Their liquidity should last for the remainder of this year and next if nothing about their business model changed.

My position in Vroom is about 10K shares at an average of $1.60 and 43 $5C and 250 $7.5C for Jan 2023. So yes, I am up a fair amount.

Add 72% institutional ownership and 21% short interest in the mix as well."|0.82|25|0|25
t3_wqu4aw|1660755474|pennystocks|Enterprise Group inc.(TSX:E), Consolidator of energy services with potential of high ROI $E.TO|"[Enterprise Group, Inc](https://enterprisegrp.ca/). (TSX: E) (the **""Company""** or **""Enterprise""**)**.** Enterprise, a consolidator of energy services (including specialized equipment rental to the energy/resource sector), emphasizes technologies that mitigate, reduce, or eliminate CO2 and Greenhouse Gas emissions for small to Tier One resource clients.

From the mid-teens per share in June 2021 to the low 40 cents per share a year later, the share price has advanced with close to a triple. While clients and competitors were feeling the resource pinch, Enterprise grew its service offerings and deepened its shade of green. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just review the chart below.

Enterprise depends more on management than flash to build value. Over the years, it has developed a business that has morphed from specialized equipment supply to resource companies to one that aggressively pursues mitigates, reduces, and/or eliminates CO2 and Greenhouse Gas emissions for its established and new clients; be they start-ups or global Tier Ones.

Growth has also been steady and impressive, as the price chart illuminates. Over the pre-pandemic years, when resource companies were not a growing sector, the Company ensured that they maximized what they had and how they capitalized on it.

Having had continuous positive cash flow, the Company has managed to maintain a continuous share buyback plan to benefit the employee and public shareholders.

**Research**

“We (FRC) are initiating coverage with a BUY rating and a fair value estimate of $1.06 per share (weighted average of our DCF and comparables valuations). Upcoming catalysts include Q2 solid results and increased adoption of the company's portable power systems. Enterprise's historical revenue (2014-2022) has been strongly correlated to oil prices. During 2014-2022, Enterprise revenue has increased/decreased by 0.8% for every 1% change in oil prices”.

Understand that even though the research is sponsored, many stringent safeguards are in place to ensure objectivity for investors. The Company does not see the conclusions or forecasted price value until the report is released. 

**Salient Investment Report Points**

·  Enterprise's EV (enterprise value) of $31M implies that its shares are trading at just 76% of hard assets. 

·  Enterprise is one of the very few one-stop oilfield site infrastructure providers. 

·  It is estimated that Canada's oil and gas field services market will grow 15% this year vs the five-year average of 5% p.a. (Source: IBISWorld). 

·  The company started offering portable/mobile power using natural gas and replacing diesel generators so that clients can realize cost savings and achieve their Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals. Note that natural gas is one of the cheapest and cleanest energy sources. 

·  Enterprise is trading at 4.3x EBITDA vs the sector average of 9.2x. Upcoming catalysts include Q2 solid results and increased adoption of the company's portable power systems. 

**Q2 Looks Good**

**As the Q2/22 results have also been released,** investors will see that the Company delivered impressive numbers instead of being historically the slowest in the sector industry-wide.

During the first two quarters of 2022, the Company delivered robust results. Arguably, the launch of its new subsidiary, Evolution Power Projects (EPP), was even more exciting. This innovative division heralds a new approach to resource company infrastructure.

*EPP is the leading provider of low emission, portable power systems and associated surface infrastructure to the Energy, Resource, and Industrial sectors. The company's highly innovative methods are delivering its client's low emission natural gas-powered systems and micro-grid technology, allowing clients to eliminate diesel entirely. EPP's systems are equipped to deliver real-time emission metrics providing its clients with the assurances necessary for them to accomplish their ESG reporting and objectives. (PR August 11th)*

Enterprise has demonstrated a penchant for keeping an eye on growth and providing investors and shareholders with notable information to enhance growth. The current situation in the resource market, particularly in Western Canada, demonstrates how it is a proxy and a growth vehicle for the oil price and the significant rise in capex spending that has been broadly noted recently.

Here are some further information/opinion resources. A review of these will give compelling reasons to consider Enterprise Group as a potential addition to your portfolio noted.

Stay tuned; there’s way more.

Over 11000 acres 100% working interested and Fully funded for current drilling campaign they just got approval yesterday

Drilling is in Permian basin and will consist of 2 wells currently up to 11000 feet and verified by a 3rd party audit to contain around 28m barrels of oil.

Oil prices have stabilized at highs and the strategic oil reserve is at the lowest its been since 1985  their position can be drilled year round and can be done with convential vertical wells or horizontal .

Permex's return on investment is high at current energy price levels. The wells in Permex's land position are among the cheapest to operate and may be profitable when oil prices are as low as $29 per barrel. Finding and development costs are estimated to be $13.80/bbl. At current oil prices near $90/bbl., operating netbacks are near $60/bbl. and the return of investment is less than two years.

Reserve analysis points to higher company value than indicated at current stock prices. An independent study completed last year estimates 24.5mm BOE of proved and probable reserves capable of generating $924 million in future net income ($285 million in present value assuming a 10% discount rate) based on an assumed oil price of $65/bbl. The estimated present value of reserves is roughly 20 times the company's current enterprise value.

Channelcheck rates the shares Outperform with a $4 price target. The  price target is based a two-stage discounted cash flow analysis that assumes a weighted average cost of capital of 15%, near term cash flow projections based on current energy prices that decline each year until reaching an oil price of $60/bbl and a gas price of $4.00/mcf, and a long-term growth rate of 3%.

In addition to owning its acreage position, Permex has acquired royalty interests in 73 producing oil and gas wells operated by large energy companies such as Apache (10 wells), Callon Petroleum (7), Conoco Phillips (17), Double Eagle Energy (11), EOG Resources (11), Marathon Oil (10) and others. The properties are generally located in the Permian Basin but also include wells in East and South Texas. The rights generally extend to future drilling within a designated area but not for drilling into new formations. These royalties provide a steady flow of cash to cover operating costs and help fund drilling efforts. Permex purchased its royalty rights during the downcycle to give it an exposure to rising energy prices without having to take on operating risk. Management has indicated it is open to purchasing new royalties should we enter another downcycle but is more interested in drilling its own wells under the current circumstances."|0.78|5|0|5

t3_wqo4vb|1660740500|pennystocks|Bull Case - It's $PRTY Time|"The recent meme-stock rally is very reminiscent of 2021, and it’s got me about as jacked up as a Boomer with a portfolio full of T-Bills in a newly built 55+ community McMansion. If we learned anything from GME, AMC, BBBY, etc., the right question to ask right now is “WTF is next!?”. I took it a step further and asked, “what would Papa Cohen do”? So, while everyone was laser-focused on BBBY over the last few weeks I decided to do some digging around for value plays \[for the record: I am also long BBBY\].

Something I noticed across all these names, other than the obvious short interest:

1. They are brick and mortar retail with what appears to be one foot in the grave
2. Low market cap, though AMC might be an exception
3. Low share price for easy degenerate option bets
4. They are all nostalgic companies from the 90s and 00s
5. Recently beat down prices with higher-than-normal short interest
6. They are all companies struggling to pivot in the consumer space

A few weeks back, someone brought a name to me that checked all of these boxes and then some, that name is Party City Inc (PRTY). I know what you are thinking “I haven’t stepped food in one in this decade”, “that’s a penny stock”, “their balance sheet is dogshit” – but hear me out.

1. 800 company-owned and franchise stores throughout North America
2. Market Cap of $229mm as of writing, super low
3. Share price of $2 as of writing, super low
4. Brand name that I know, and that I recall shopping at as a youngin
5. Down over 60% YTD, Short interest &lt;10% Float (and growing)
6. Obviously struggling to pivot – like guys just give me an app I can order supplies/balloons/etc. on

In recent disclosures PRTY mentioned how they were having trouble fulfilling inventory due to supply chain issues. Now, this is arguably, but I would say that is a great problem to have. That means there is more demand for the goods they sell than the supply! Anyone else having flashbacks to ECON101? I’m no expert but to me this is a major plus, and just a temporary problem.

In addition to this they have the opportunity to pivot and further increase demand/revenue, assuming they can get the supply issues under control. Have you been tot heir website? Absolute garbage imho. Just give me an easy way to order what I need and have a pickup and delivery option at a reasonable fee. They’d have their market segment in the bag if they pulled this off.

There is also the elephant in the room… HALLO –fricking- WEEN\*\*.\*\* **Halloween and 4Q have historically been a profit driver for PRTY, and now with COVID restriction mostly behind us, its increasingly likely there will be a massive revenue bump as people start getting out and about**. Remember – those COVID babies are now 2 years old, and new parents LOVE Halloween (and spending $$$ on it).

Now let’s look at some numbers…

https://preview.redd.it/39shdxw9s9i91.png?width=149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=467b2e1456ee25a00f5812e2312e165bf1316682

There is not much that can be said other than this is exactly what a value play looks like. They are literally reporting more income than their shares are worth.

https://preview.redd.it/d3svujuas9i91.png?width=169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98bf099cda5757da294a5f13068d518bcfcedde3

Bonkers ROE. This is the type of stuff P/E and Hedge Funds pull. Something has got to give, and my guess is it will be the equity price increasing, which decreases this ratio.

https://preview.redd.it/a60d9kqbs9i91.png?width=163&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0bd40d5dca515933bb16369a913326a49c280f8

Yikes - This looks no bueno. The thing is, most companies’ have debt and given PRTY’s depressed equity price it likely makes more sense issue long-term debt than to use their equity should they need capital.

&amp;#x200B;

[I see you staring at the little tip up at the end there you dirty monkey](https://preview.redd.it/2503edqcs9i91.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb693961205d7144b9d6083bfdef0b4897964698)

This stock has just been beat up, as has most of the market. It started trending up recently, which I find really interesting - meme basket trades? pure momentum/beta? large buyer who sees similar value? I'm banking on the latter.

**TLDR**

PRTY has been so beat up that the equity is being valued as if they are essentially bankrupt. I am taking the bet this company is a going concern, and that the brand name alone worth more than $200mm in current market cap.

I don’t give advice - I just give my opinion. Always do your own homework!

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug. 09, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novation Companies, Inc. ([NOVC](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2Q3GTek4K10leYyPUq_RiWJ9Qd8gpaeBbVexZVM-Kiy-zZu1qRooeQeeUYls6LOqY4mUkZU8nZfbXJTZwBIFxg==)) (""Novation"" or the ""Company""), which through its subsidiary Healthcare Staffing, Inc. provides outsourced health care staffing and related services in the State of Georgia, is announcing an amendment to its Senior Secured Note Purchasing Agreement dated July 27, 2017 and related senior notes.

On August 9, 2019, Novation executed a First Amendment to Senior Secured Note Purchase Agreement amending the terms of the purchase agreement and related senior notes.  The key terms of the amendment are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

* For      the period from April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2023, Novation will pay      an interest rate of 1% per annum on the principal balance outstanding      under the senior notes, with interest payable quarterly.
* For      the period from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2028, Novation will      pay an interest rate of 2% per annum on the principal balance outstanding      under the senior notes, with interest payable quarterly.
* For      the period from January 1, 2029 through the later of the maturity date or      until the loan is paid in full, Novation will pay an interest rate of 10%      per annum on the principal balance outstanding under the senior notes,      with interest payable quarterly.
* On      April 1, 2019 and on July 1, 2019, Novation made payments under the senior      notes totaling $2.7 million.  The actual aggregate amounts due under      the amended senior notes on those dates totaled $0.4 million.       Therefore, Novation paid a total surplus of $2.2 million on those dates.
* Under      the terms of the amendment, this payment surplus will be credited towards      Novation’s future quarterly interest payment obligations under the senior      notes, such that at the new interest rate Novation will not be required to      pay additional interest under the senior notes until the quarterly period      commencing April 1, 2022, when the surplus will be exhausted leaving      interest payments for that quarter totaling $0.2 million.
* Under the amendment, Novation will      issue to holders of the senior notes a total of 9 million shares of common      stock, as well as 10-year warrants to purchase a total of 22.3 million      shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share.
* Additionally,      Novation agreed under the amendment to direct 50% of each year’s excess      cash flow (beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019) toward      principal reduction on the outstanding debt balance under the senior      notes.
* The      Company had $85.9 million of unpaid principal amount outstanding under the      senior notes as of June 30, 2019.
* Lastly,      under the amendment, the financial covenants under the purchase agreement      will not apply until the period ending December 31, 2021.

The amendment will be described in additional detail, and the full text of the amendment will be filed as an exhibit to, the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

David Pointer, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, stated, “We are very pleased to announce this development.  We welcome our senior noteholders’ involvement in Novation as equity investors and appreciate their willingness to amend our structured payment schedule with them.”

Ask yourself what happens to a stock when it goes from 0 revenue to an estimated $30M(minimum value for low grade Wollastonite -  based on old pre fertilizer crunch pricing) to possibly over $100M(high grade niche organic markets with carbon credit embedded valuation) in annual revenue.  To be clear VERT's Wollastonite is high grade low impurity product.

Ask yourself what it means when that amount of revenue is based on a small fraction of initial production.  Current production max is 100 000 tons, and quarry upgrade permits are not difficult when your mine is a safe distance from residential/commercial/agricultural land.

Quarry margins are extremely high, as staffing is low.  Your only production costs are a few staff, and diesel for the crusher or excavator.  Ask yourself:  What do high margin companies do?  High margin companies often have excess liquidity.  It allows them to expand faster, and reward shareholders with early dividends/share buybacks.

Large jumps in stable revenue can lead to uplisting.  More eyes on the stock = Better base valuation.

Current share price at halt $0.205 CAD.  Min/Max Analysis. $300/t at 2.3x mining average revenue multiple = share price of $0.56 CAD.  $1000/t at 10X niche market rapid revenue growth multiple = $8.11 CAD.

Value it where you will, but there is no arguing that the large scale of this resource will be utilized as they expand with fully funded exploration, and grow revenue with continued green and organic market off-take agreements.

Disclaimer: I do own VERT, but I will be holding a large portion of my position passed $2.00 CAD.

   * Pre-tax Net Operating Income of C$ 2,140M
   * Base case metal price parameters of US$ 1,735 per ounce of gold and US$ 21.75 per ounce of silver
   * After-tax NPV5% of C$ 577M, IRR 23.5%, and 2.7-year payback
* Capital light development
   * Initial capital of C$ 493M (including C$ 72.8M in contingency)
   * Life of Mine capital of C$ 632M
   * Strong 1.9:1 Initial Capex to Pre-tax NPV5% ratio
   * Minimal pre-strip limited to TSF starter dam construction
* Long mine life with exceptional expansion opportunity
   * Total resource production of 46.3 M tonnes over 12-year mine life
   * Average annual production of 169k AuEq ounces

*John Williamson, CEO, commented, ""The PEA clearly demonstrates the low cost and robust return of the Lawyer's Gold-Silver Project even when stress tested with considerable contingency in the base case. We continue on a straightforward pathway to advancement. We continue to test new targets on the large prospective land package to add value to a project that is simple, low risk with a high-grade near surface open-pit resource, combined with proximity to existing infrastructure, making it one of the best candidates to become British Colombia's next precious metal mine.""*"|0.86|14|0|14

Shares of the float sold short represent roughly 14% of shares outstanding, and it is priced at $0.25. We could see a significant jump in price in the coming days. 

**Rationale:**

EJH is currently trading at $0.25 representing a significant value ratio with regard to its underlying operations. [Revenue growth](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/ejh/financials/) YoY has increased 61%, representing its efficacy in retaining net revenue. I believe that it is

2.) In a prime position to experience a gamma squeeze due to its large percentage of shares sold short

Mitesco released a new investor deck today and it is very bullish. Let’s look at a few key points below: 

3-7 new clinics still projected by the end of the year. That means only 4 months away. Huge growth and PR opportunities coming down the wire. 

3 pending insurance companies to be added to covered under the good clinic. They recently got approved by Aetna which is a giant provider! 

Clients confirm that they are greatly exceeding their expectations. The Good Clinic now has 262 five-star online reviews.

The number of office visits increased 35% Q2 over Q1.

Office visits generate nearly four times greater revenue than vaccine visits.

1658 appointments in q2, an increase of 11% from Quarter 1 alone! 

Government and commercial payers have set provider reimbursements based on time spent with the patient. Q2 total minutes of care increased 112% over Q1.

These are all significant numbers and bullish signs!

(NASDAQ: VGFC) (TSXV: [VERY](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/the-very-good-food-company-reports-second-quarter-2022-financial-results-822422661.html#financial-modal)) (FSE: OSI), a leading plant-based food technology company, today reported its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022.

**Some Highlights:**

* Wholesale revenue increased 117% to $987,278 in Q2 2022 as compared to the same quarter last year due to an increase in the number of stores and distribution points as well as increased unit velocities on core and new items.
* General and administrative expense decreased $3,899,256 or 57% to $2,935,624 in Q2 2022 compared to $6,834,880 in Q2 2021. Excluding share-based compensation and depreciation expense, adjusted general and administrative expense decreased $1,563,585 or 28% to $4,038,034 in Q2 2022 compared to $5,601,619 in Q1 2022. The decrease in adjusted general and administrative expense was primarily driven by a decrease in salaries and wages.
* Net loss decreased 46% to $(6,699,130) in Q2 2022 compared to $(12,500,733) in Q2 2021.
* As of June 30, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $6,156,414, a reduction of $15,819,239 from $21,975,653 as of December 31, 2021. This decrease is primarily related to the Company's greater than expected cash burn during the quarter. As of the date of this MD&amp;A, the Company's cash balance is approximately $3.2 million to settle current accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately $4.3 million.
* During the six-month period ended June 30, 2022, VERY GOOD made the strategic shift to focus on sustainable growth and a path to profitability as opposed to solely focusing on top line growth. As part of this shift, VERY GOOD decided to limit its eCommerce sales due to high digital marketing costs to acquire new customers, lowered production, and headcount at some locations to manage inventory levels, implemented initiatives such as pausing non-critical capital expenditures and lowering general and administrative expenses.
* Refocused Strategy: The Company continues to implement its three-prong approach to (1) Stabilize, (2) Right-Size, and (3) Optimize, first announced in May 2022. The Board and its strategic advisors are focused on the stabilization prong and the management team, led by the CEO Parimal Rana, are executing to Right-Size and Optimize. The Right-Sizing efforts have mostly been completed with the closure of the restaurant operations and consolidation of production facilities into the Rupert Facility. With the re-focusing of sales away from eCommerce and toward wholesale and food service the Company is also reviewing strategic private label and co-manufacturing opportunities to fill excess production capacity and increase revenue.

This would be huge for ALS suffers if Nurown gets FDA approval. I am a little confused though what happened to its stock price today. On Friday, the stock price spiked nearly 19% percent with the news of the erratum that was published. Then, on Monday morning, it spiked to $4.70 because of the BLA announcment. Then it gradually declined until it closed slightly below its opening price this morning.

Report Highlights:

Q2 results were weaker than expected. Newmont’s EPS was 10% lower than expected due to lower production and higher cash costs  amid inflationary pressures. Barrick’s EPS was 5% lower due to higher cash costs; production was in line.  

We are lowering our EPS and fair value estimates for both producers. 

We are expecting a rally in gold prices in H2-2022 as the Fed is likely to take a less hawkish stance in its meeting next month due to weaker economic activities and GDP growth. Business activities in the U.S. contracted last month, indicating that job growth should slowdown in the coming weeks. We believe high inflation and slower than expected rate hikes are highly conducive for gold.

$EDXC

CAVE CREEK, AZ, Aug. 15, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — via NewMediaWire – Endexx Corporation (OTC: EDXC), a provider of innovative plant based and sustainable health and skincare products now available in 8,000 Mass Retail and Pharmacy stores nationwide, today announced its Form 10Q, third quarter ending June 30, 2022.  Endexx continues to rebound and show growth in mass retail sales. The 8000 mass retail stores are in the early stages of growth and are anticipated to fluctuate and grow over the remainder of fiscal 2022 and accelerate in 2023 and 2024 respectively.  Endexx reported $418,151 in revenues in its third quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $120,801 in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, a 246% increase. Additionally, nine-month numbers showed an increase of 127% with $947,428 in the first 3 fiscal quarters of 2022 over $416,094 in the same period of fiscal 2021.­­­­­

“The third quarter showed continued expansion in revenues in Mass Retail stores. We currently are in the top two National Pharmacies and the largest premium Mass Retailer in the US,” stated CEO Todd Davis. Davis added, “Opening orders in mass retail is the beginning of long-term sales cycles, expansion requires investment and Endexx has managed the challenges of this growth cycle as efficiently as possible given the current financial markets.” Davis concluded, “With ongoing anticipation of Federal Regulatory advances, we believe this industry is still in its infancy and has the potential to become a leading multi-billion dollar growth industry in the next few years. According to Nielsen Ratings, Endexx’s topical balm and topical cream are the Top Two selling CBD topical products in the pain aisle in Nationwide Pharmacies.”

Recorded in Q3 financials is an extraordinary non-cash derivative liability.  This is due to the Double Diamond trading in April that allowed below market trading prices to be posted in time and sales records in quotation services. Endexx is working to correct the condition that created the non-cash derivative loss.

Heard about this new company capitalizing on “ghost kitchens” out of Canada. For those of you who don’t know a ghost kitchen is a kitchen used to make food for virtual restaurants on UberEats and other meal delivery apps. If you have heard of Mr. Beast Burger, many of his restaurants listed on food delivery apps were ghost kitchens. These “ghost kitchens” solve the problem that are large barriers to entry that traditional brick and mortar restaurant establishments face. More on that below: 

**Some Pros of restaurant operators using COHO ghost kitchens:** 

\-Shaves off months of licensing and permits. 

\-In house capital and consulting for clients. 

\-Community of cooks &amp; chefs in every location. 

\-Commercial grade kitchens. 

\-lowers startup risk for entrepreneurs. 

For a restaurant operator wanting to quickly and cheaply set up a kitchen, ghost kitchens seem to be the best option as everything is prepared for them, they just need to sign a lease and get set up with food delivery apps. It takes less than 7 days to start selling with COHO. 

This is a really good explanation from COHO on what ghost kitchens are and what their style of ghost kitchen is: [What are Coho Commissaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8_0znAAvUY) 

Walkthrough of one of their Vancouver locations: [Welcome to Coho Creekside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xknrabvRnQk) 

**Some stats from UBS and Hospitality Technology:** 

\-Ghost kitchens Kitopi, Cloud Kitchen and Kitchen United raised over 1.9B combined. 

\-Ghost kitchens are projected to be worth 71.4B by 2027 and online food delivery 365B by 2030. 

**Some highlights on COHO Ghost Kitchens:** 

\-3 active locations and 1 under construction. 

\-M&amp;A opportunities to acquire existing ghost kitchens, real estate partnerships and acquiring food productions related facilities.  

\-Announced collaboration with Beyond Oil (company that provides fryer equipment that extends the life of oil and reduces waste ie. Reducing costs) 

**Financials:** 

\-Stock Price:  $0.24 CAD 

\-Market Cap:  

\-AVG Volume: 49.58k 

\-Increased total assets from $4,019,795(Dec 31st 2020) to $7,208,366(March 31st 2022)

**Conclusion:** 

Coho still has a lot of groundwork to do before getting into the big leagues but their team seems to have the plan laid out and already acting on it (Victoria under-construction location). This makes them a long-term player in the industry.

t3_wozebv|1660569273|pennystocks|Netlist inc, a unique story between seminal patents and CXL hybriDIMM progress. $NLST|"Sometimes it happens to read about incredible stories of companies and all those variables that lead an unknown company to ride the media wave and exploit the market to become famous and strong as a zoom tech.

I'm sure 99.9% of readers have never heard of netlist inc and the 912 patent but I'm sure everyone is using this invention indirectly every day.

But first let me introduce you to netlist inc.

Netlist provides high-performance solid state drives and modular memory solutions to enterprise customers in diverse industries. The Company's NVMe™ SSDs in various capacities and form factors and the line of custom and specialty memory products bring industry-leading performance to server and storage appliance customers and cloud service providers. Netlist licenses its portfolio of intellectual property including patents, in server memory, hybrid memory and storage class memory, to companies that implement Netlist's technology. 

Patent 912 is one of the most incredible inventions of the last 20 years and now I will show you exactly why it is called a seminal patent.

Back in 2009, Netlist sued Google in a Delaware court, and said that Google had wrongly used Netlist-patented IP – specifically US Patent No. 7,619,912 or the ‘912 patent, which refers to the use of rank multiplication in an LRDIMM (Long Range DIMM) memory module. Such DIMMs can have four ranks or blocks of memory, and the patent describes IP to present the LRDIMM logically as only having two ranks, thus getting over system memory controller limits on the maximum rank count.

Agni Research explained “Netlist asserts that the ‘912 patent enabled Google to build servers with high capacity and rapid memory that allowed said servers to store an entire Oracle database in memory which allowed lightning-fast search results. The ‘912 patent played a large part in Google’s dominance in search.” 

This patent is google's real success as a search engine, the best way to find information and alphabet's main source of income.
This invention changed the rules of the game and made google one of the largest and most powerful companies in the world.
Now I report two recent news of the google and samsung case where the 912 patent is mentioned.
There have been great steps forward and the truth is about to be brought to light thanks to the victory of claim 16 and the validation of the patent 912 which effectively authenticates the patent of netlist inc.

“”Netlist Receives Favorable Order in Patent Infringement Case Against Google

Netlist Receives Favorable Order in Patent Infringement Case Against Google
IRVINE, CA / ACCESSWIRE / May 6, 2022 / Netlist, Inc. (OTCQB:NLST) today announced that, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the Court) issued an order granting Netlist's motion for summary judgement on intervening rights as to claim 16 of Netlist's U.S. 7,619,912 (‘912) patent.

Netlist, Inc., Friday, May 6, 2022, Press release picture
As a result, Netlist's enforcement of claim 16 cannot be abridged, and may proceed unencumbered by Google's latest attempt to escape responsibility for their long history of using Netlist's intellectual property without permission. The ‘912's other claims were subject to intervening rights by the order, and they will continue to be asserted by Netlist under a narrower window of time for quantifying the harm caused by Google's acts.

C.K. Hong, Netlist's Chief Executive Officer, said, ""This ruling stands as vindication of Netlist's rights in its decade-plus fight against Google. We now look forward to a complete discovery of Google's make and use of infringing products over this period, and bringing this case before a jury as soon as possible.""

Netlist believes that the teachings of the '912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry.””

And the second and the latest news against Samsung and sounds good 

“”Netlist Receives Favorable Order Against Samsung in US District Court
NLST | 12 days ago
IRVINE, CA / ACCESSWIRE / August 3, 2022 / Netlist, Inc. (OTCQB:NLST) today announced that the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the Court) issued an Order granting in part Netlist's motion for dismissing Samsung's First Amended Complaint and denying Samsung's request to file a Second Amended Complaint.

Netlist, Inc., Wednesday, August 3, 2022, Press release picture
The Court issued a written opinion supporting the Order, and dismissed Samsung's Counts IV, V, VI, VII, X, and XI from the case. The partial dismissal means Samsung cannot pursue a separate action on the patents Netlist first asserted in Texas, and now cannot carry out its alleged obligation to protect Google from the ‘912 Patent in Delaware. In addition, Samsung voluntarily withdrew its Motion to Sever and Stay the case that Netlist brought in the Eastern District of Texas.

Jayson Sohi, Netlist's Director of IP Strategy, said, ""We are pleased Judge Andrews dismissed half of the pending claims from Samsung's Delaware lawsuit, including the ‘912 claim. We look forward to continue defending our intellectual property rights in the remaining portion of this case.""

Separately, following the Order, Netlist filed a complaint against Samsung in the Eastern District of Texas for Samsung's infringement of the ‘912 Patent””

It is difficult to fight against giants like samsung and google, they are very influential and rooted in the American courts. They have senators and other influential people who always support their game but the truth will come out sooner or later.
I have been an nlst shareholder since 2018 and have always been optimistic.
Today I see the light and today I am aware of what will happen in the coming months.
Netlist is not an investment advice but it is a story that all readers should read at least once in their lifetime. This is contemporary history."|0.92|79|0|79

OLB Group ($OLB) is in e-Commerce services and some Bitcoin mining. Earnings for Second Quarter should be MUCH higher than last year--because the company bought a $20 million revenue company late last year. OLB has said publicly they expect $35 Million or more revenue this year vs. less than $10 million last year. OLB at $1.65.

Mawson Infrastructure ($MIGI) in Bitcoin mining. Ugly chart...but their earnings report should show a huge increase in bitcoin production vs. last year.  Over 40,000 crypto mining machines are up and running. Surprise earnings may wake up investors who have forgotten about this beaten-up crypto miner. It has not rebounded like the other crypto miners have.---  $MIGI at $1.00

SinglePoint ($SING) is in solar energy. Volume and price recently exploded to the upside. Recent solar energy tax credit news should help their revenues big time. The company has been expanding through acquisitions--so revenue comparisons versus Second Quarter last year should show a 500% or more increase. Very low market valuation of $11.3 million (considering they say $35-$40  million in revenue is possible this year, VERY undervalued)---. $0.156 was Friday's close after hitting $0.22 earlier last week from a start at $0.10.

t3_wngxja|1660403898|pennystocks|$EMBK final days here|"Embark Autonomous Trucks

So yesterday was quite the attention getter for anyone watching $EMBK. Up 88% on 169M share volume (average daily volume under 4M). 

To put this in perspective, more shares of EMBK traded yesterday than traded from 7/1 through 8/11 COMBINED! 

The earnings call Thursday night was the reason for the heavy buying on Friday. $220M cash on hand. No debt. Planned commercialization for 2024 on track. Team is confident and gave little hints about details they are working on with Knight Swift for commercial deployment. They lowered cash burn to +/-110M/yr extending runway. I highly suggest taking a half hour and listening to the earnings call. 

In any event- reason for the post is to say goodbye to the pennystocks sub. On Monday, the EMBK board will hold a vote to decide on a reverse split anywhere from 15:1 to 30:1. This will ensure they remain listed in Nasdaq and improve perception/liquidity. Many institutions are not able to buy penny stocks so this will open the company up to more institutional grade share holders. 

Market cap is still under 500M even after yesterday’s wild move. Competitor (TSP and AUR) market caps are $2-3B. While the competitors have more cash on hand (+/-$1B), they also have significant overhead and have capital intensive business models. Embark has the right idea- be an asset light software provider and partner with best in class OEMs, shippers and carriers to make autonomous trucking a reality. AVs are safer than human drivers and significantly more economical. By law, human drivers must take a minimum 10hr break after 14hrs of driving. AVs can run straight across country, only stopping for fuel and inspections. Efficiency and data is the name of the game here. 

Regulatory environment is surprisingly supportive. Companies are legally allowed to operate AV trucks in the entire sunbelt (with the exception of CA and Mississippi as of now). More and more states are adopting guidelines. Good luck all. Hope to see you all again with another play in the future. But for now- I’m hanging with the EMBK team for the journey to commercialization."|0.78|16|0|16

Its batteries provide flexibility to grid operators and energy assurance for commercial and industrial customers. Its technology addresses energy delivery, duration, and cycle-life in a single battery platform that compares favourably to lithium-ion batteries. The company was founded in 2011 and is headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon.

ESS Tech reported their Q2 for the year (ending 30 June) on 11 August and for the first time since being founded they reported a revenue - amounting to $680,000 and a landmark moment for the company. Their share value increased by more than 18% during subsequent daily trading.

Investors should still note the net loss of ($15.6m), significantly higher than their revenue - representing a net margin loss of 2,294%. Net losses in recent quarters have been as high as ($180m). Investors could be betting that the net margin loss will improve ahead of a landmark moment for renewable energy in the US.

If signed into law, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) would allocate $369bn to households and businesses to solely invest in renewable energy sources – a historic amount that scientists estimate will lead to carbon reductions of 40% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels - as well as positively impacting climate-related equity investments.

The first thing worth checking when a company is seeing consistent net losses is how strained its current assets to current liabilities are becoming.

In the short term, the current assets and current liabilities can measure a company's ability to pay short-term debt or obligations due within one year. ESS Tech's short-term liquidity percentage in Q2 was 6.83% (current liabilities/current assets) - demonstrating significant control over short-term liabilities. This significantly improved compared to last year's quarter, which was 8.97%

Current assets and current liabilities stand at $199.4m and $13.6m, respectively.

Total cash for the company is up significantly from recent times, seeing $8.02m as of 30 September 2021 increase to $239m by the end of 2021. Total cash has since fallen to $112.7m for Q2 - however, softened by liquidity.

Total assets were down over the last six months to $216.1m (from $250.2m) - however, total liabilities have also decreased significantly to $29.3m (from $40m).

Long-term liquidity percentage improved in the last six months from 16% to 13.6%.

2021 was also a landmark year for ESS Tech to bolster its balance sheet and get on top of previously elevated liabilities seen in the previous two years. Total assets from FY20 to FY21 increased from $9.02m to $250m (with 95.6% consisting of total cash) - while total liabilities remained fairly flat at $45m.

OkePartners are the individuals, companies or charities who can share their invitation code with anyone to become OkeMembers. OkeMembers can enjoy great discounts offered by OkeMerchants. For all the spending of OkeMembers at OkeMerchants through OkeApp, the corresponding OkePartner would receive a commission of up to 5% of the discounted amount.

The Company also announced today that since the soft launch of OkeApp early this year, it had recruited more than 500 OkePartners.

As well as two recent personnel acquisitions; Siegfried Yu as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company and Ernest Kwan as the General Manager of OkeApp ([www.okepartners.com](https://www.okepartners.com)). 

The OKE App has 131k merchants total, 568 partners and over 1.8 million members: Virtually every type of good is available, from retail to clothing to travel to food. 

Readon’s strength is acquiring distressed assets, selling off the weak parts, and growing the best assets. The free App is available in all the usual places.

The Company is aggressively pursuing an uplisting to the OTCQB. It hopes to conclude this tear.

Richard Klitsie, CEO of RHCO, stated, ""RHCO has started the year of 2022 very well, and we are thrilled to announce the completion of its quarterly filing. We are riding on the momentum of OkeApp and Readies, and both are performing well beyond our expectations.”

RHCO reported an increase in Revenue of 634.42% compared to the quarter ending December 2021, which is also a year-over-year increase of 161.39%. After two previous quarters of a minor loss, the Company has recorded a nominal profit, and its Net Assets saw a rise of 1.99% compared to last year's end.

Here is a link to what can only be described as historically impressive quarterly results. While the concept is simple, there is no predicting what businesses will be added to the mix. Given the provenance of the executives, the risk/reward scale seems to tilt to the latter.

Readen is an aggressive trader with a 52-week range of USD$0.02 to USD0.21. Not a bad run for a pinkie.

Lots more to this one. Lots.

Below is a post I've submitted 3 months ago, most of the info remains unchanged and I want to update it slightly. If you've already read this before, skip to the end where there'll be an update/evaluation of what happened between the past 3 months: Did management fufil their goals? What's their latest progress etc. etc.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**OLD POST**

TL;DR: price target of $2.25, $3.6, $4.5, $5 (see valuation)

Goedecker (GOED) is an e-commerce business that sells appliances and furniture in the US. A reverse merger happened in Q2 2021 which caused massive share dilution and financial misrepresentation. The legacy Goedecker acquired Appliances Connections in a deal valued at 200 million (via share dilution etc). Legacy Goedecker is not a very well managed business, making 56 million revenue in 2018 and 55 million in 2019. Appliances Connections on the other hand is the real deal, making around 300 million revenue in 2020, 540 million revenue in 2021, and currently expected 640 million revenue in 2022. [https://www.appliancesconnection.com](https://www.appliancesconnection.com/)

The best part is that the management team from appliances connection moved to the current Goedecker along with the CEO and others. They have made management changes and hired new talents. More can be viewed in ([https://investor.goedekers.com/overview/default.aspx](https://investor.goedekers.com/overview/default.aspx)) and their presentation ([https://s25.q4cdn.com/225826556/files/doc\_presentations/2022/05/GOED-Q1-2022-Investor-Presentation.pdf](https://s25.q4cdn.com/225826556/files/doc_presentations/2022/05/GOED-Q1-2022-Investor-Presentation.pdf)). Their CEO Albert Fouerti ([https://thecorporatemagazine.com/building-a-brand-albert-fouerti-business-leader/](https://thecorporatemagazine.com/building-a-brand-albert-fouerti-business-leader/)) started Appliances Connection with his brother Elie in 1999 and is now a well established, growing e-commerce furniture and appliances retailer.

Competitors that has similar business model: Overstock, Wayfair, AJ Madison

Competitors in appliances and furniture industry: Lowes, Ikea, Home Depot, Best Buy, Sears etc.

First of all lets check out their financials:

Goedecker is a misunderstood company, with a market cap of 170 million it is not on most people (and funds) screeners, because of this it is currently severely undervalued, exacerbated by the fall in various stock indices.

Secondly, the reverse merger happened in Q2 2021 so their combined revenue and earnings are only shown for Q3 2021, Q4 2021, and Q1 2022. This means their FY2021 revenue and earnings and not a clear representation of the business since Q1 and Q2 are 'hidden' in stock screeners.

[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1810140&amp;owner=exclude](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1810140&amp;owner=exclude)

According to the 10K, FY2021 revenue is at 362 million (doesn't include Q1 and Q2), likewise net income is at 7.6 million without taking the first half of the year in consideration. Then looking at the pro forma which:

The following unaudited pro forma results presented below (in thousands) include the effects of the AC and AG Acquisitions as if they had been consummated as of January 1, 2020, with adjustments to give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the acquisitions.

Shows (**proforma**) FY2021 revenue is at 541 million, while net income is at 27.9 million.

Taking pro forma into account (according to earnings call transcripts and ER [https://roic.ai/transcripts/GOED?y=2022&amp;q=1](https://roic.ai/transcripts/GOED?y=2022&amp;q=1)), we can interpret the revenue and earnings as:

in millionsQ1 2020Q2 2020Q3 2020Q4 2020Q1 2021Q2 2021Q3 2021Q4 2021Q1 2022Revenue66.891.5102.2109.7123.7140.1141.9142.7152.8Net income2.60.8(3.2)(11.4)15.617.36.5(11.5)5.9

&amp;#x200B;

* I've calculated the revenue as Q3 revenue = Nine month ended proforma - six month ended proforma etc.
* Q1+Q2+Q3+Q4 = 548.4 million which doesn't add up to 541 million, this is likely variances in accounting and if anyone knows why please comment below
* The sum of FY2021 net income extracted from various 10Q pro forma accounts doesn't add up to the 27.9 million stated in the FY2021 10K. This is likely also due to accounting differences, most likely older pro forma did not take into account the loss occurred from Goedecker's side.
* The high Q1 &amp; Q2 2021 net income is likely from tax rebates due to covid and net loss in 2020, although this is unspecified in 10-Q.
* Take the chart above with a grain of salt. However the company confirmed:

&amp;#x200B;

* 541 million revenue in FY2021
* 27.9 million net income in FY2021
* 370 million revenue in FY2020
* \-11.2 million net loss in FY2020. (possibly used to tax harvest FY2021 Q1 and Q2 tax rebates, explaining the high numbers)
* Eitherway, take the above information only as a reference as pro forma and reverse mergers are difficult to calculate and often unaudited.
* Below are some footnotes in the FY2021 10-K which I think would help us understand some of the issues above.

*Income tax benefit (expense)*. We had an income tax net benefit of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to an income tax expense of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a result of the Appliances Connection Acquisition, the Company is able utilize previously derived net operating losses, as it is more likely than not that the Company will be profitable. *Net Income (Loss)*. As a result of the cumulative effect of the factors described above, we had net income of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which included net income of $30.6 million from Appliances Connection for the period from June 2, 2021 to December 31, 2021, as compared to a net loss of $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $29.2 million, or 135.6%. Excluding Appliances Connection, our net loss increased by $1.4 million, or 6.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Future Growth:

On the Q1-2022 Earnings Call, the CEO reiterated their Q4 target that:

We forecast high teens to low 20 sales growth for the year compared to 2021 pro forma sales and gross margins and adjusted EBITDA margins relatively flat to our 2021 full year pro forma results, which were 23.3% and 9% respectively.

With revenue of 152.8 million in Q1 2022, and their expectation of 16-22% revenue growth rate from 541 million (FY2021), we can extrapolate the revenue will likely fall somewhere between 620 to 660 million.

Analysts (only 2 lol) [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOED/analysis?p=GOED](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOED/analysis?p=GOED) expects:

in millionsFY2022FY2023Revenue636 (17.6% growth)731 (15% growth)EPS est. (avg)0.210.3

As stated in Q4 and Q1 earnings call, their quarterly fill rate is at 3.5%

The definition of fill rate is the percentage of customer orders you're able to meet without running out of stock at any given time. A strong fill rate is at or near 100%, meaning you're able to fulfill all of the wholesale sales you make without stockouts, backorders, or lost sales.

Albert Fouerti in Q1 2022 Earnings call

Unfortunately, I mean, it's almost holding steady to what it was in the past, I would say Q4 of 2021. We're looking anywhere from about 63.5%, 63% of fill rate. We're still struggling with the same struggles that we had in the past. Hopefully, we're looking forward to the next Q2 or Q3 to get some type of relief in the supply chain.

Albert Fouerti on Q3 2021 Earnings call

Our historical highs anywhere from eighty five percent to ninety percent and that's really what we're trying to get to in 2022

Increasing fill rate back to even 75% will increase their sales by at least 10% which is a bonus on top of their organic e-commerce appliances/furniture sales growth.

Albert Fouerti in multiple Earnings calls

We continue to believe that we are well on the way to becoming a company with $1 billion in annual sales in the next few years

Now the juicy part... Valuation:

*Currently trading at $1.6 (as of writing)*

Oustanding shares = 106.4 million

Warrants (1:1) = 92.5 million (weighted-avg exercise price of $2.3 with contractual life of 4.42yrs)

&amp;#x200B;

* What warrants does is essentially give investors the right to purchase the share at the exercise price, the company will issue these share (dilution), however the company receives the cash which adds to their enterprise value

**Assumption 1 (Pessimistic basis):**

$GOED trading below weighted avg $2.3 so warrant dilution is minimal. Outstanding shares remains at 106.4 million

Net income is lower than FY2021, from 27 million --&gt; 20 million

20/106.4 = 0.189 EPS

Assume expected revenue growth of 15% CAGR, PE of 12:

**0.189\*12 = $2.27 (42% upside)**

**Assumption 2 (bear case):**

As supply chain crisis subsides, fill rate will return to 85%, revenue continuing to grow at 15-18%. Profit margins increase to 5-6% as freight cost etc. is reduced, revenue hits CEO's expectation of $1 billion.

Net income = 1,000,000,000\*5.5% = 55 million

With their current authorised 25m buyback programme (blackout period ended 2 days ago), possibility reduce share dilution from warrants slightly --&gt; 180 shares outstanding

EPS = 55/180 = 0.3

Analysts also expect 0.3 to 0.38 EPS in 2023, assuming 15 PE

0.3\*15 = $4.5 (181% upside)

Analysts have a price target of $5 (low) and $8 (high)

Catalyst:

&amp;#x200B;

* Next quarterly report will display the correct TTM info (21Q3, 21Q4, 22Q1, 22Q2) which will help stock screeners. Also gain coverage
* $25 million authorised buyback plan that started 2 days ago due to blackout periods
* Rebranding happening 'in the next few weeks' according to the CEO
* Introduction in the russel 2000 (unlikely but may happen)
* General recovery of S&amp;P

Risks:

&amp;#x200B;

* Cost of living crisis, lowering demand for appliances/furnitures and reducing revenue and earnings
* Supply chain shock lasting (or worsening) far beyond 2023 which hurts profit margins
* Recession, interest rate rising, general market downturn
* Proforma results are unaudited and hard to say whether it's correct or not, also since it was a private company, appliances connections doesn't disclose any financial statements prior to 2019.
* Risk of warrant dilution (although cash received will go towards Enterprise Value)
* Catalysts not forming (e.g. not introduced to russel 2000), S&amp;P doesn't recover etc.

All in all I believe it's a good buy and my highest convictions based on its financials, decent future and large margin of safety

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**New Updates:**

Currently, $POL is at $1.52

In light of the recent inflation figures, jobs data and in my opinion, a slightly more optimistic economic view compared to 3 months ago, the fundamental business of appliances connections continues to flourish. 

According to [https://www.similarweb.com/website/appliancesconnection.com/#traffic](https://www.similarweb.com/website/appliancesconnection.com/#traffic), the traffic on the appliances connections website increased from 2.8M in may to 3.1M in July, showing no signs of slowing down.

Q2 Earnings Call should be within weeks and the stock's earnings run-up has begun and in my opinion, will continue. When earnings are announced we may see upwards of $2.0 to $2.2

For the past half year (and possibly more), this stock has been heavily distorted by low volume and large shorts (avg. 50-70% short). I believe this will change through the next earnings report where the YOY results will be consolidated between legacy Goedecker and Appliances Connections.

Furthermore, the new ticker has changed (POL) as addressed by the management in the last earnings call. The current website [https://www.polished.com](https://www.polished.com/) is slightly disappointing as it's still in the 'COMING SOON' stage, nonetheless, with strong financials and upcoming catalyst (earnings report), I believe it can easily hit $2 and perhaps more depending on ER."|0.83|4|0|4

We are happy to answer any questions you may have and encourage you to visit our website at [mindmed.zone/letter](https://mindmed.zone/letter)

SHERIDAN, Wyo., Aug. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, FCM MM HOLDINGS, LLC (""FCM"") announced that it has sent a letter to the Board of Directors of Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc. (NASDAQ:MNMD) (the ""Company"" or ""MindMed"") calling on the Board to adopt a new strategic plan proposed by FCM including: refocusing on its core drugs, cutting cash burn, and terminating MindMed's at-the-money equity offering. FCM is directed and managed Dr. Scott Freeman, co-founder and former Chief Medical Officer of MindMed, who has offered to provide MindMed his expertise as a director on MindMed’s board.

As detailed in the letter, FCM believes MindMed has underperformed—operationally, financially, and strategically—as a direct result of management’s lack of focus on its core drugs: MM-110 (18-MC) and MM-120 (LSD). FCM contends that MindMed can bring MM-120 to market in four years rather than seven to eight years, by re-classifying MindMed’s Phase IIb study on MM-120 to a Phase III study. FCM also proposes that the Company reduce costs from forty-five million dollars per year to under twenty-five million dollars and that the unnecessary and dilutive at-the-money offering should be eliminated. By executing these proposals, FCM believes that MindMed can unlock significant long-term value for MindMed's shareholders.

FCM's large economic stake in MindMed reflects its convictions regarding MindMed's potential and gives it a strong interest in the success of MindMed.

The full text of the letter is available and can be downloaded at [mindmed.zone/letter](https://mindmed.zone/letter)

**About FCM**FCM is managed by Dr. Scott Freeman and represents an investment of 5.6% of MindMed's shares outstanding. Dr. Freeman's investment in MindMed is in excess of nineteen million shares or 4.51% of MindMed's outstanding shares. FCM's letter is additionally signed by Chad Boulanger. Chad Boulanger has an investment in over four million shares of MindMed or 1% of MindMed's outstanding shares.

FCM additionally represents other early investors in MindMed who all have a strong interest in seeing the long-term success of MindMed.

“It appears many shareholders, lets say, on this Board, are young, or inexperienced, and have not really put a sizable chunk of money into a stock that has a fair chance at being a Homerun.  A possible Homerun type stock picks up a LOT of criticism, and many doubters.  It has to be that way.  BioLargo, in many ways, fits the criteria I mentioned above.  IF BioLargo appeared to EVERYBODY as a SURE-THING, or a stock that was gonna go up 10X ............ then it's present price would already be bid up.  Maybe to a dollar.  Remember, if BLGO is .20, and goes up 10X, it = $2.00.  A Homerun stock!  But IF BLGO has been looking GREAT to EVERYBODY, No critics, and the sh price has floated up to $1.00, then rising to, again, $2 is nice but not crazy exciting to some of us.  Of course, in today's dangerous stk mkt, a double is wonderful.  Anyway, some of us reject certain negative types on this Board because we have made the Look-See-Decision that BLGO could be a 10X up stock.  A Homerun.  I'm one of them with about $180,000. invested in BLGO.  Julian is another.  That is a LOT of money for either one of us.  I'm slightly in the green.  I believe J is too.  I believe both of us have had Homerun stocks before.  That may change our thinking somewhat from the average reader here.  We KNOW what is possible.  We Know it can be life changing.  I expect we both wonder if the ALWAYS Negative people here are just Young, or just Inexperienced, or, just never had sizable-money in a Big winner?  So we invite ALL to invest in BLGO and swing for the fences.  You CAN'T hit a Homerun unless you actually ... Go For It.” 


OP:

Very well said, Joe. If it would be easy, everybody would be doing it. And when it will be obvious to everybody we will be trading much much higher and this would not be such a massive opportunity anymore. 
We did the DD and are following every tiny step of the company closely. 
Most of the 1/2 million dollars I invested here is from my above 2000% Exas gains - I expect higher returns here.
It feels like it will be obvious for everybody that BioLargo will be a massive winner really soon… 😉

When I posted this on the BioLargo discord @mrlongfellow replied the below- I highly recommend to read the link he provided. 
“This is well said. Howard Marks has a lot of good things to say about this as well. You need to be patient and willing to look wrong before you get the big payoff. “

So...as businesses grow quickly and consumers continue to increase their dependence on technology, companies need to make sure that they have access to the data needed in order to make informed business decisions. Thanks to modern analytics and data lakes, smart companies can now gain a competitive advantage leveraging their data across various departments and driving a more efficient business model.

**Now, my hopefully intrigued friend, what is a data lake?**

*A data lake is a digital repository for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. It allows you to store the data in one place, where nobody knows what's in it or who put it there. Your team can extract any data, at any time, without having to request it from another division.*

This saves many hours daily that would be spent collating and formatting this information with no chance of errors coming from different systems sharing bad data. The cost savings come from simply having access to the raw data when needed rather than waiting for it to be requested and processed; thus saving manpower hours as well as not needing to purchase specialized software or hardware such as ETL tools or cloud services to perform these tasks.

**Wow MurkyDinner...why would I, a savvy investor, care?**

As you may know, part of ESE's growth strategy includes developing and deploying its proprietary DataLake/BI infrastructure to deal with big data ingestion and subsequent processing of said data. The ability to pull in large amounts of useable data will prove to be lucrative as it is commonly believed that data is the number one product for e-sports adjacent companies. Think about it, marketers, developers, and everyone in between want as much data on current and potential gamers as possible to target the right people in the right places. If you, like $ESE, can build a large repository of useable data, you are well poised for success."|0.71|3|0|3

1) Already established company active in multiple countries across almost all continents, they are slowly but surely grabbing market share in the wearables space from the big players like Samsung, Apple and Garmin.

2) They have designed and build their own chips and OS which allows them to have smartwatches that are extremely energy efficient. This is not just some marketing trick, I know multiple people in possession of these watches (including me!) and I own a GTR 3 pro with 12 days battery life easy.

Good Morning Penny Stock Portfolio Retail Traders!!!..... Today will be a rally in The Market Place 

The OTC seems to follow close behind the Nasdaq Private Market and Weed Stocks are all trading up.... No New News just an Organic Market Bounce during a Bear Market. 

What happens in the cannabis industry can at times be a positive or negative catalyst for marijuana stocks. This month many cannabis companies will be reporting earnings. Shareholders and investors feel that companies will show strong earnings. The potential of these strong reports it could help marijuana stocks like **$RTON** see a rise in trading. 

When positive news is released depending on the importance and urgency of the news can have an adverse impact on the cannabis sector as a whole. Yet when company reports opening a new store or launching new products historically the upward pushes have been limited. Online conversation continues around the success of Right on Brands, Inc. a company on the rebound and the passion behind the signature brand Name and Products Endo Brands. I am encouraging All Shareholders STAY the course, for us to do better, we Have To Do Better... 

The Product Endo is on fire, The Compnay Is making Changes and The Price Pattern Will Change!!Now as many who watch the sector know any and all positive news on federal reform has been the biggest catalyst for marijuana stocks. Still, with the cannabis industry developing more and more each day, there are many reasons to be invested. Cannabis companies are showing to have increased profits and growth through new products and dispensaries and cultivation facilities, There are some cannabis companies that have become what is known as super companies due to strategic partnerships through mergers and acquisitions.

""*When we founded Plantable, the concept of having a turnkey solution that reversed diet-related chronic disease, paid for by the insurer, was novel. We were very early,""* said Nadja Pinnavaia Ph.D., CEO of Plantable. ""*While it is still early days, progressive health insurers and self-insured corporates (the payers) are now beginning to understand and accept the value of Food as Medicine as a solution to lower exploding costs pertaining to chronic disease. We are seeing new companies come to market with high valuations without any proven clinical evidence of their efficacy. Plantable is ahead of the competition in its clinical grounding and its exceptional results. There is a huge opportunity for Plantable, now. The timing is right and we are actively pursuing it.""*

&amp;#x200B;

* **Revenue** in Q2 2022 increased 14% to $308,864 in Q2 2022, compared to $271,790 in the same quarter last year primarily; driven by especially strong new Reboot growth in May and June (+109% and +126% respectively), compared to the same period last year. Q2 2022 revenues were 28% lower than Q1 2022, which is in line with seasonality shifts (2021 - 30%).
* **Cost of sales** was $224,423 in Q2 2022 compared to $185,144 in Q2 2021, representing an increase of $39,279. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher food input prices as well as significantly higher shipping expenses. Given the magnitude of the current inflationary environment, management is pleased that cost of sales have remained in line with Q1 2022. The Company continues to manage costs carefully, seeking ways to reduce cost of sales wherever possible to offset rising input prices and increases in labor costs.
* **Operating expense** was $888,628, of which $593,624 were expenses attributable to the Operating company, with the balance ($295,004) incurred by the public company including share-based payments of $131,389 in Q2 2022; compared to $3,079,610 in Q2 2021. Operating expenses declined by $113,827 compared to Q1 2022, driven in part by a 25% reduction in the paid media marketing spend and a significant reduction in investor relations marketing given the capital market environment.
* As of June 30, 2022, the Company had cash on deposit in the amount of $1,622,456, accounts receivable of $19,859, prepaid expenses of $92,986, and inventory of $108,395 compared to cash on deposit in the amount of $3,321,966, accounts receivable of $120, prepaid expenses of $285,885 and inventory of $73,342 at December 31, 2021.
* In 2022, the Company's strategic focus was to strengthen and expand the direct-to-consumer business by resetting the base marketing foundations. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2022, Plantable, in line with its strategy, completed the segmented new website, developed new ad creatives, transitioned to HubSpot (an integrated marketing and content management platform), and completed the build-out of the analytics platform. Today, Plantable has clear metrics data for analysis and for future optimized growth.

Since going public last year the stock has seen a downward decline of 86.29% at the time of this writing. Post reverse split the shares are expected to trade in the $9/ share range making the stock look much more attractive then the $0.57/ share it is currently being traded at. 
There has been much negative sentiment around reverse splits. I view this reverse split as a good thing for the company. I believe this company in the psychedelic health space will have a great impact on patients all across the USA and Canada. I believe this company has a lot of growth to undergo. Starting in 2023 Oregon will be the first state with wildely legalized psychedelics. Look at the bill being proposed here in the USA along with the current administration bluntly saying they expect and want psychedelics to be an alternative treatment for things such as
Anxiety/ Pain/ Opioid Use Disorder/ Autism Spectrum Disorder. 
$MNMD has active trails going on right now most of which are nearing phase three and if applicable and successful registration will begin. Big things to come for this company. I do not doubt this is a speculative play, but this could be an opportunity for a great long term investment with exponential growth. That’s why I recommend taking a look into $MNMD even as we go into this RS."|0.91|80|0|80

Trading down RIGHT now over 75%... is it a SHORT?, Is It a Sell Off? Is It GOING Our Of Business?

Magic Empire Global: The Second Biggest Bubble in 2022

* Magic Empire Global (MEGL US) is the second biggest bubble in 2022, after AMTD Digital (HKD US). 
* We believe there are two major reasons for MEGL’s surging share price including US retail investors’ buying frenzy post AMTD Digital and the “scarcity effect” of new Chinese IPOs.
* Sell MEGL as it makes little sense to put any of your valuable amounts of capital into this stock. The bubble has already started to burst on MEGL. 

Do we continue to buy it at the low of the day or wait for it to trade Under $5.00 and will it Go Back will the IPO excitement continue? $MEGL The Bubble No one seen coming!!!

Magic Empire Global’s shares saw their value skyrocket—from $4 per share to nearly $236 per share, an increase of almost 5,800%. On last Monday, the stock ended its magical ride, to a degree, and as of roughly 8:30 am PST, it was trading at less than $25 per share!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. Their product (Pritumumab) is a human antibody, which makes it less toxic and less reactive.

2. This has already been through phase 1 and 2 testing in Japan only 30ish years ago! It was proven safe and effective.  It was only lost as the previous ""owner"" of it died and was left in legal limbo, until NBIO picked it up.

3. The product has potential use against other cancers than just brain tumors, such as lung, breast and even pancreatic!!! ANY help in the battle against pancreatic cancer would be massive 

4. It's been shown to prevent viral load entry into cells, which ***could*** be a good starting point for one of the fabled ""universal vaccines""  (but this is a theory.


Their biggest challenge will be funding in the future. They already have some agreements which will provide money once they complete phase 1 and start phase 2.   But after that they will need to raise capital.   However I bet they get BIG interest from the major pharma companies (pfizer?) On news of successful phase 1 data.

(TSXV: APN) (WKN: A2JNFG) is pleased to announce a new discovery at the Maria Luisa Project (the “Project”), located 100 km north of La Serena within the Atacama region in Incahuasi, Chile. Drill hole 22MLDDH012 intersected 10.50 metres (m) of 3.76 grams per tonne (g/t) gold (Au) and 3.83% copper (Cu), including 3.00 m of 2.30 g/t Au and 8.26% Cu, and 4.50 m of 6.03 g/t Au and 2.19% Cu; results are in Table 1.This drill hole was collared at the 867 m level of the current underground workings at Maria Luisa.

**Program Highlights**

* Drill hole 22MLDDH012 is a new discovery north and west of historical underground workings. The area has never been historically drilled or mined, follow-up work is underway to delineate the scope and scale of this new discovery.
* Rocks hosting high copper and high gold grades in 22MLDDH012 vary with depth.
   * 1.00 m of 0.88 g/t Au and 2.36% Cu is from copper and iron oxide that is spatially associated with a fault gouge zone.
   * 10.50 m of 3.76 g/t Au and 3.83% Cu is associated with a silicified breccia zone characterized by blebby to massive copper sulphide (chalcopyrite) and disseminated pyrite.
   * At depth, 0.50 m of chalcopyrite-bearing intrusive returned 6.46% Cu.
* Assay results are pending for four drill holes that intersected intervals similar in appearance to the high-grade breccia zone of 22MLDDH012.
* The Company has developed 410 metres of the NW-SE trending Maria Luisa Decline and is now approximately 23 metres from the projected initial target length. Cross cuts to the SW will intersect the vein system to support the proposed mining plan.
* The decline advance also allows the Company to continue testing exploration targets from underground drilling.

Alastair McIntyre, President and CEO, commented, “We are very encouraged with the discovery of this new zone and the corresponding high-grade gold and copper assay results. The recent work at Maria Luisa has focused on developing our underground decline system while establishing strategic underground drill locations. This provides the opportunity to drill new targets efficiently to support exploration and potential mine development with the added advantage of expanding our understanding of the multi-vein system at Maria Luisa*.”*"|0.9|35|0|35

The first procedure was performed at Indiana Spine Hospital in Carmel, Indiana by Dr. Mario Brkaric, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon.

The HOLO Portal system is the world’s first surgical guidance system incorporating AI and AR and the first clinical application of Surgalign’s HOLO™ AI digital health platform. HOLO Portal’s convolutional neural networks process intraoperative images to autonomously identify patient anatomy and plan patient-specific pedicle screw trajectories approved by the surgeon. The system then displays the anatomy and pinpoints the trajectories for ease of placement, using the AR display.

In January 2022, the Company received U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for the Portal system’s use within lumbar spine procedures, and today, announced commencement of clinical use. The Company has now moved into its limited market release and intends to ramp up its site locations. As cases are performed and data is accumulated, the Company also intends to integrate new applications on its platform to advance the quality of care and improve patient outcomes.

“HOLO Portal is a remarkably efficient technology in that its AI autonomously labels anatomy and proposes a surgical plan from intraoperative imaging. I then view the resulting guidance information in 3D through its holographic display. This helps ensure that every pedicle screw is precise in its size, trajectory, and placement,” said Dr. Brkaric. “That improvement in surgical precision can help lead to better patient outcomes and fewer complications. This is groundbreaking technology, and I expect that many more surgeons will adopt the HOLO Portal in our practice and across the country.”

“Congratulations to Dr. Brkaric for completing the first surgical case with the Surgalign HOLO Portal system,” said Dr. Rick Sasso, founding member and President of Indiana Spine Group. “It’s great to see the physicians at Indiana Spine Group adopting new technologies and I look forward to adopting the HOLO AI technology into my practice to drive better patient outcomes.”"|0.83|27|0|27

Performance Shipping (Ticker symbol $PSHG) report positive cash flow of $3.5 million dollars. Diluted EPS of $0.10.

Recently they have acquired a sixth Aframax tanker ship. They break even around $16k a day, and they averaged $24.9k per day last quarter. Since then, rates have continued to climb, with the company mention rates at $28k/ day on July 1st, then mentioning rates exceeding $35k on the date of the earnings just last week. 

The increasing rates could more than double the $3.5 million profit from last quarter. Any amount of profit over $731k would make the common stock holders eligible for a dividend. $PSHG currently pays out 50% of the lesser of Quarterly End Cash Flow and Quarterly End Excess Cash. Last quarter the Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents was about $13.2 million. For financing reasons They are required to maintain $5 million plus $1.5 million per ship ($5M+($1.5Mx6 ships)=$14 million dollars) in liquidity. Anything over that is deemed “excess cash”. 

Having only been $731k shy of excess cash, we are certainly going to make enough to qualify for a dividend at the end of this quarter. How much? If we match our profit from last quarter, they will be almost $3million in excess cash, and half of that will be paid to common stock holders per their dividend policy. 

Currently there are 27.3 million shares outstanding. There are warrants at $0.35 and warrants over a dollar. If those are exercised, there will be 44.3 million shares. There’s almost $100 million in shareholder equity. At current share count it should be closer to $3.50, diluted it should be $1.75 at least just based on equity. 

None of their ships will a survey in the next year, and they were at 100% utilization last quarter. Now they have an additional ship. One ship is is charted at a profit for the next two years at $23k/day. The other five ships are operating in the spot market at rates that “exceed $35k/day”. 

Realistically I’d say a very conservative estimate is $5 million in profit; however, if rates stay up in the $30k+ range, we’re getting closer to $7-$8 million in profit. That would put Quarter end excess cash around $4 million to $7 million (or more (or less)). At 50% payout (which goes as high as 90% as debt is reduced) that’s $2-$3.5 million to be payed out in dividends. 

What’s this mean? 

Worst case scenario: it’s diluted to 44 million shares and you get a 4.5 cent dividend on your stock that currently trades at 35 cents

Medium case scenarios: fully diluted by warrants but they blow out profits and you get about 8 cents dividend on your 35 cent share/ or they don’t dilute but they make a modest profit and you’re around the same.

Best case scenario: Warrants aren’t exercised and you get around 12 cents dividend per share.

I personally believe the $0.35 warrants will exercise, but only because I expect the share price to recover dramatically. Not advice, just quick DD that is ripe for critique. Bless"|0.88|24|0|24

This article is a bit dated (article is from 7/21/22), but $DAVE CEO Jason Wilk makes some comments that imply positive trends for the upcoming 8/11 PM earnings release:

 “For Dave, we have great unit economics, we’ve got good gross margin on all of our business, we have a great solid CAC/LTV. Companies that are out there that are public have some of those challenges around economics, and we’re all getting bucketed together, whether it’s correct or not.” 

\- Wilk said the innovation \[in overdraft products\] took the industry by storm, “**We added 6 million customers** with less than 60 million of venture capital raised, compared to our competitors that have to raise billions to get even close to parity on the customer numbers.” 

About the **$100 million FTX just invested in $DAVE**:  
“We have an opportunity to offer crypto to the under 30 demographic of customers who are living paycheck to paycheck,” he said. “I think that’s where the interest lies from FTX.” 

And $DAVE has lots of capital and may use that for M&amp;A:  
Wilk said there had been ups and downs, but the scariest time of the year has been the drop in stock price, **and not because Dave is running out of money. He said they have all the capital they need for their business; they have been profitable most quarters in the past,** but that’s not why they went public.

**“We have all the capital to run our business,** but we went public for a few reasons. One was to attract capital, two for employee retention, and three **to use that public currency for m&amp;a**,” he said.

t3_wjad6x|1659969191|pennystocks|Tripadvisor Stub-stock: Catalyst arrived on a dormant special sit|" ***TL;DR:*** TripAdvisor (TRIP) has a little-known stub-stock Liberty Tripadvisor (LTRPA). LTRPA is a holdco stub-stock owning Tripadvisor (TRIP) shares (21% of Tripadvisor, spun out of Liberty-complex). Think of LTRPA like leveraged version of TRIP. Pull up today or Friday's pricing on LTRPA vs. TRIP to get a sense. Multi-bagger potential on straight equity; no theta/etc.

***Catalyst:*** If TRIP's technical-breakout sticks LTRPA is going to be a ***fun-time***. Hypothetically at this discount it should move 2-1 vs. TRIP. Ex: TRIP rallies 10% = LTRPA rallies 20%.

Here is a Barron's writeup from last summer on the situation: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/liberty-tripadvisor-is-a-leveraged-way-to-play-tripadvisor-at-a-discount-51627293616](https://www.barrons.com/articles/liberty-tripadvisor-is-a-leveraged-way-to-play-tripadvisor-at-a-discount-51627293616)

It is a very interesting Greenblatt-style play. Spin-off, holdco discount, low market-cap (funds unable to enter, small-investors get first dibs), low-liquidity, and low share-price ***BUT*** trades it off of $3.5bil market-cap Tripadvisor.

**LTRPA notes:**

* ***Steep*** holdco discount. LTRPA simply owns roughly $600mil of Liberty's stake in Tripadvisor but it trades at a $250m market cap. The holdco gap narrowing to normal holdco-margins should provide a decent return in-and-of itself. You're buying $1 for $0.50.
* It's Liberty Media. Greg Maffei &amp; John Malone love making money. (*We're just gonna forget the QRTEA part of Liberty mythology lmao*). LTRPA is undoubtedly a stain of Maffei's reputation and he would *love to change that*. He plays to win.
* TRIP may be finally breaking its brutal downtrend. A lot of special-sits folks have sidelined LTRPA for this very reason; just letting the pain settle first and letting the market say when to ***go***.  

   * Why did the downtrend break? Tripadvisor is turning around slowly. The new Liberty-appointed CEO is finally taking the reins and the quarter was solid. There's enough bad-news baked into price that it's fairly asymmetric now.
* Travel recovery looking good. TRIP &amp; LTRPA were murdered by COVID.
* Tripadvisor is a *good asset* historically run by underwhelming management.
* Nice market backdrop with the bear-market providing a natural tailwind. Tons of shops are trapped short/underweight-equity during a very oversold environment. Recession will be a shallow-one or non-existant after Q2 GDP revisions until late-2023.

**Price Example**

The last time TRIP traded $30/share, LTRPA traded $2.50/share. It's a little more complicated than that but you can get the idea.

**Risks to consider:**

* LTRPA is very small and illiquid. Do not use market orders. Anything this small &amp; illiquid can whipsaw you fast. Please be diligent on risk-controls and size it accordingly. For myself personally I'd size it like you'd size a call-option: 1-3% of portfolio.
* Historically Tripadvisor has been a place money goes to die. This is a very contrarian play.
* LTRPA had a fairly big fuckup in March 2020 with a margin call that was ultimately bailed out by Certares.

Enjoy &amp; have fun on Greg Maffei's money-train. I mostly lurk so don't expect much chatter from me; just thought this was a fairly juicy sit to share.

**Disclosure:** Long LTRPA. Small option-sized position in my PA &amp; client accounts

**Edit:** My thesis has nothing to do with LTRPB's weird trading over the past week or so. Liberty B-shares are Malone's way of keeping control interest over Liberty (supervoting shares) and are thus very illiquid.

**Edit 2:** [Here is a VIC-writeup](https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/LIBERTY_TRIPADVISOR_HOLDINGS/4513657655#description) from 2018 outlining how to spread the old LTRPB/LTRPA holdco discount. It gives a pretty good overview of the weird A/B mechanics of Liberty but keep in mind this is pre-2020's margin-call fiasco."|1.0|3|0|3

In 3 days Solo Brands $DTC will report earnings and so far the stock price has been rising in anticipation of it. In fact the stock managed a trend reversal in recent weeks and is finally well positions to make a nice break out to the upside.

According to Ichimoku we just saw a bullish ""Kumo twist"" were the red bearish Cloud turn green (you have to zoom in), this is one of the best technical indicators of an upcoming breakout, today we also see $DTC\`s upwards momentum being backed up by Volume, which is another positive sign.

The past resistance at 4.76$ now enacts as a strong support, so buying at that level is one of the best entry points. 

The stock has been heavily shorted by people who don't believe in the business model, but they will be proven wrong in my opinion, this will give the stock even more upside momentum on good earnings, making it easier to reach 8$-10$ February price levels.

So far 66% of all companies beat earnings, amen among them, which is a great indicator of how much money people spend online. I expect a nice run up at Earnings, but as always do your own research and if you like the stock... LFG!"|0.84|13|0|13

Vertex started producing in its new facility rising revenue by 500%, becoming Cash flow positive and profitable!|"Vertex Energy ($VTNR) bought a fully operational, highly profitable Oil refinary from shell, due to shells hydrocarbon reduction program.

**$VTNR is highly shorted with 26% of the free float,** so if news are good tomorrow we will see a huge run up of the share price. In my opinion even beyond the 18$ we had after the latest announcement. $VTNR already went from 11$ to 14$ in the last week in anticipation of the news, but with a Market Cap of $890M its still very cheap, compared to M240$ earnings and $3.2B revenue.

If $VTNR is evaluated like the oil industry average, we are looking at 25$-35$ share price, combined with the high squeeze potential run ups to 50$+ are possible.

Actually I expect $VTNR to crush earnings expectation, because the forecast were made while the oil price was much lower and no Ukraine war on the horizon, so I have bought shares and 15$ Calls in anticipation.

My only reservation is, why did  Xphosah really get shot down from last year. 

From what I’m seeing it passed all clinical trials and seems to be a good alternative to Binders, the current drug for high phosphorus levels.

Since the beginning of 2021 only one other company has produced more profits than MariMed and that is Green Thumb Industries(GTBIF) which currently trades at $10.00.

MariMed is greatly undervalued on account of being a relative unknown in a landscape of uncertainty regarding the timing of federal legalization thus the sector being out of favor with retail investors. The current federal legalization status also keeps the sector largely(but not completely) out of reach with institutional investors but since it's dual-listing on the CSE less than a month ago already a number of private institutions and ETF's have reported taking positions.

""*MariMed might be the best kept secret of any cannabis multi-state operator (MSO) with more than $100 million in revenue, but it probably won’t remain that way. The company trades at 7 times trailing 2021 EBITDA, 5 times this year’s estimate and approximately 3 times my estimate for 2023* ***and this is all with no leverage***"" - Aaron Edelheit - CEO MindSet Capital.

Up until recently MariMed was categorized as Tier3. Their re-categorization to Tier2 probably has something to do with the following:

$MRMD vs Tier-1:

Any company can strike lightning for a Q or two but consistency in this sector has proven to be illusive except for a select few. Tomorrow will further establish MariMed as one of the most efficient operators in the space as they continue their streak of positive reporting despite inflation/recession among other sector specific difficulties that weigh heavy on most other MSO's.

The Company intends to combine modified mRNA technology with Regen's existing siRNA ( small interfering RNA) intellectual property targeting the NR2F6 nuclear receptor which has been identified as a potentially very important immune cell inhibitor (an immune checkpoint) and cancer stem cell differentiator."" ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regen-biopharma-inc-announces-program-120000581.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regen-biopharma-inc-announces-program-120000581.html)

In general, I think people are looking for announcements on the progress of how the company plans to finance and start clinical trials of some of their patented applications. Some of this technology is pretty new (the NR2F6 therapies) and some are not (Checkpoint Inhibitors). The Checkpoint Inhibitors recently underwent some clinical trials by Sloan Kettering that resulted in each patient having their colon cancer put into remission. ([https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2022/06/07/cancer-study-shows-promise-in-trial-of-patients-rectal-cancer-intv-ebof-vpx.cnn](https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2022/06/07/cancer-study-shows-promise-in-trial-of-patients-rectal-cancer-intv-ebof-vpx.cnn)) Regen is looking to combine the two for more general cancer therapy applications.

The last run for RGBP occurred earlier last year that went to $.08. There's no guarantee that will happen again, but I believe that if the stock holds above $.01 on Monday, we are likely to see a run continue higher with no real resistance until $.015 or $.02.

I know many people have issues with the history of the company and wonder about the efficacy of its treatments or even the legitimacy of the company in general. However, the company has successfully become OTC Pink, continued to reactivate or file new Intellectual Property, pursued partnerships, and consolidated debt. The prolonged decline in price has largely been driven by dilution to pay the company's previous debts, of which some remain outstanding. Regardless, based on the company's trajectory, I believe this is a solid opportunity for both short and long-term gains.

Full disclosure, I am a current shareholder, and this isn't financial advice. Just my personal thoughts. I'm curious to read the community's thoughts!"|0.87|11|0|11

Yesterday AH it had earnings  which didn't seem that stellar. It rallied hard before close and walked  back down to its resistance line today. I Listened to the earnings call  and that's where the goods were. So why should you care?  Because this  little micro-cap could end up being the 800lb gorilla in the room.

What should you care about?

Board booted the old CEO for not bringing their new product to market correctly. So who replaced him?

This Guy [https://www.actiac.org/bio/tony-scott-1](https://www.actiac.org/bio/tony-scott-1)  That's right, this little micro cap is now headed by the EX-CTO of GM  who has also been the CIO for Disney, Microsoft, VMware and the Federal  Government.

In last nights  earnings call an investor said I know you didn't come here to run a  company that has even 10x our current revenue. To which Tony replied. I  came here because I was super impressed with the technology this company  has and I had to be a part of it. [https://ir.intrusion.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx](https://ir.intrusion.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx)  that's where you can find the Aug 4 earnings call. I listened to it 3  times last night to make sure I didn't miss anything. I also went  through their Q-10 SEC filing here [https://ir.intrusion.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx](https://ir.intrusion.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx).  whats important to note is that they actually would have blown out  earnings if the payout on their new government contracts had of fallen  in Q2 on their payout. So the meager 12% rev growth is not accurately  representative of what we are going to see Q3 and Q4.

So wheres the real juice to be excited about?

Its all in what Tony has done in the past 6 months and whats going to happen in this quarter and moving forward.

Intrusion has

Reduced  sales and marketing expense by going from a direct in house sales team  to leveraging MSSP's to provide greater speed to market and better cost  structure

Refined go to market  strategy. Their product suite is not a direct competitor to preexisting  security suites but is a complimentary add-on that increases the threat  deterrence and strengths zero trust architecture in a system.

They  have made a supplier partnership with SuperMicro to supply hardware for  and continue refinement on their Shield product which is new to market.

They  developed two new products that are currently in demo capability and  will be rolling out live this quarter. Shield Cloud and Endpoint. Those 2  additions expand their TAM (Total Addressable Market) and make a more  complete enterprise envelope.

Implemented agile framework for GAAP tracking

Made  deals with 3 large mssp's Invifivan, One Smart Labrotory, and Intercore  Technology. He mentioned on Aug 4 earrnings calls the specific  advantages this provides and is worth a listen.

They have increased Gross Margins

They have secured operational funding to finish the year and will be expanding funding to fuel growth in 2H.

Their products are unique and and once people get to see it in action this thing is going to be big.

Im  long this. This is not a recommendation to buy. Due your own due  diligence. I believe this is going to be Yuge, but what do I know.

The jist of this right now is :

SIRC has a number of upcoming catalysts, Like other clean energy stocks, the Inflation Reduction Act is a major catalyst to watch as SIRC could soar if the Act passes the Senate’s final vote. Meanwhile, SIRC is in the process of a Form 10 filing. The filing is imminent per the company, Another catalyst to watch is the company’s upcoming Q2 financials on August 15th. With SIRC projecting **$225 million in revenues this year, SIRC could report more than $50 million in revenues for Q2.** SIRC is also awaiting its name change approval by FINRA to rebrand as SolarEV. Meanwhile, **SIRC could be well-positioned to receive additional funding for its projects in case the Inflation Reduction Act passes** the Senate. SIRC's subsidiary Plemco is already one of only 16 companies in the USA that are part of a $5B GSA BPA EVSE bid process, Plemco got HUBZone classed in that contract meaning the Government will try to give them at least 3% of the total funding ($150m over 5 years).

**SIRC Fundamentals**

**Solar Systems**

With energy prices soaring, the demand for cheaper and cleaner alternatives has been climbing. Through its subsidiaries, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)is well-positioned to capitalize on this growing demand as it offers solutions for installing solar power systems. Since solar systems are considered to be the most affordable energy services in the market, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)is in a prime position to bolster its revenues thanks to the rising demand for such energy services.

With this in mind, SIRC’s subsidiaries are well-recognized throughout Southern California as they have been operating in this market for several years. Based on this, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)has the opportunity to expand its footprint into additional states to gain extra revenue streams.

In light of the company’s focus on solar energy, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)entered into a JV with Renewable Energy Products Manufacturing (REPM) for the financing of solar products to non-profit entities. Considering the financing difficulties faced by nonprofits, this JV unlocks an underserved market for [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)– allowing the company to become a leader in this market. According to this JV, REPM will offer the financing for these systems through its fund and [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)will sell and install these solar projects.

As this JV will protect nonprofits from the rising energy prices while avoiding the issues they face to secure funding, the JV is witnessing high interest with 8 nonprofits approved for installation. In light of this interest, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)projects to install 100 additional systems this year alone – which could allow the company to further grow its revenues.

**EV Charging**

In addition to solar systems, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)is prioritizing its EV charging business through its subsidiary – PLEMCo. To facilitate this new business focus, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)has a $30 million EV charging project pipeline and $20.2 million EV charging project backlog to realize more revenues in light of the growing number of [EVs ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/MIL-EVS/). With this in mind, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)signed an LOI to acquire 3 Los Angeles-based EV charging installers with contracts worth more than $100 million in their pipeline. At the same time, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)was included in New York’s Charge Ready program which will allow the company to grow its EV charging revenues outside of its main market in Southern California. In this way, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)could be on track to achieve its projected revenues of $225 million for this year.

As the EV charging market is in its growth stage, this business focus could allow [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)to emerge as a major player in this growing market. Based on this business focus, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)intends to rebrand to SolarEV to reflect its emphasis on solar and EV charging. Given that the company already applied for a name change with FINRA, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)stock could surge upon receiving approval for its name change.

Meanwhile, PLEMCo was one of 16 companies awarded a 5 year blanket purchase agreement from the US General Services Administration as part of the $5 billion in federal funds allocated to EV charging stations. This funding is part of the [Biden ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/US-BIDEN/)Administration’s Infrastructure Bill which aims to install EV charging stations every 50 miles along the interstate system. While PLEMCo’s BPA is a design and material only contract for level 2 and level 3 EV chargers, the subsidiary submitted a second BPA to include design, equipment, and installation of EV chargers. With PLEMCo expecting to be awarded this BPA this year, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)stock could be one to watch in anticipation of more news.

Considering PLEMCo’s reputation in the EV charging market, the subsidiary will be a featured sponsor at Fully Charged Live North America – the world’s largest EV show – next September. During this show, PLEMCo’s CEO Brad Rinehart will lead a panel discussing carbon footprint reduction and how the proliferation of EVs can reduce the impact of climate change. By featuring in a show with this scale, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)could forge relationships with other major players in the EV industry. As the EV market is growing at an exponential rate, SIRC’s [venture ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SGX-V03/)in this industry could prove to be extremely profitable in the long-term.

**Inflation Reduction Act**

Currently, clean energy stocks including [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)stock have been gaining momentum lately after a deal was announced to introduce the [Inflation](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/fundamental/) Reduction Act to a final vote last week. Among the bill’s provisions is over $9 billion for the federal procurement of American made clean energy. The bill also includes $30 billion in grants and loan programs for states and electric utilities to accelerate the transition to clean energy. Given that PLEMCo was awarded a BPA by the GSA, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)could be on track to receive additional funding from the government and capitalize on the solar and EV incentives included in the bill. With the Senate preparing the bill for a final vote as soon as this week, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)stock could soar if the Act passes.

**Form 10 Filing**

With the company looking to become SEC reporting, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)completed the auditing of its financials and is preparing to file its Form 10. To facilitate this, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)has to increase its AS to ensure that the AS covers all preferred shares issued by the company. With this in mind, filing Form 10 could allow the company to pursue an uplist to the OTCQB which could be a major catalyst for the company. With the company sharing that the Form 10 is imminent, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)stock could be one to watch this week in anticipation of the filing.

**SIRC Financials**

In its Q1 financials, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)reported significant financial growth in a number of key metrics. In terms of assets, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)grew its assets to $171.3 million from $158.5 million in the previous quarter. However, the company’s liabilities increased from $63.6 million in Q4 to $68.9 million in Q1. In terms of revenues, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)witnessed major growth as it reported $26.9 million compared to $3.4 million a year ago. While operating costs increased from $2.5 million to $5.1 million in the same period, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)managed to report a net income of $5.6 million despite reporting a net loss of $2.2 million in the same year-ago period. With the company planning to release its Q2 financials on August 15th, [SIRC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-SIRC/)stock could be one to hold since the company is projecting $225 million in revenues for this year.

My DD, (I am only a beginner, real basic stuff)
-Solid CEO
-Innovative 
-a potential solid competitor for these corona and maybe, the monkey pox vaccines (also whatever future stuff comes)
-Has a history of making solid vaccines that do not draw a bad reaction from the human body
-Uses a new, special kind of vaccine (not a doctor, but basically this tricks the virus in a different way from other vaccines)
-Has an amazing ROE, ROI, and ROA. 

The only main problems I see with this company is maybe the income, but they are a small, growing company so some of that is to be expected.

East West Petroleum has assets in both New Zealand and Romania. In Romania it has NIS as its partner, dealing with sanctions right now. A deal for these assets was beginning of the year almost finanlized with far lower energy prices. Serbia government clearly wants NIS to produce and Romania needs it as well. A deal can't be that difficult with the support of Serbia government to get this producing.

(TSX-V: CPAU) (OTCQB:COPAF) is pleased to announce new drill targets generated from the recently completed induced polarization (IP) / resistivity geophysical surveying at the Company’s flagship Kinsley Mountain Gold Project (the “Kinsley Mountain Project” or “Kinsley Mountain”) in Elko County, Nevada. In total, 80 line-km of geophysical surveys have been completed at Kinsley, over a 9 km north-south strike length, covering an area of approximately 30 km2.

Interpretation of the survey data has identified a minimum of eight (8) untested high-priority targets at Kinsley North. The final phase of IP/resistivity surveying announced here specifically targeted the frontier Kinsley North Range, which contains a significant strike length of prospective, faulted Pogonip Group and upper Notch Peak Formation carbonate rocks that are known to host significant gold mineralization at the Long Canyon Mine1 located 90 km north of Kinsley. The observed chargeability and resistivity anomalies indicate potentially significant fault displacement coincident with mapped faults, arsenic ± antimony ± gold in soil anomalies, and prospective known gold hosting rock units.

Jeremy Yaseniuk, CEO, commented, *“The Kinsley IP survey has already generated eight new, high-quality drill targets in the underexplored Kinsley North area. The geophysical anomalies show a strong correlation with soil anomalies, faults, and alteration, similar to the known Kinsley gold resource zones, but are associated with the host rocks for gold mineralization at Long Canyon, which has produced over 1 million ounces of gold to date1,2. We believe that these new targets warrant drill testing.”*"|0.82|15|0|15

The company's President and CEO Dennis P. Calvert said, ""While we are pleased with our financial results from this quarter, we believe this is just the start of dramatic growth for our company, driven by (i) the expanded sales and expected retail launch of POOPH by our white-label pet odor control partners at Ikigai, (ii) the anticipated launch of our proprietary PFAS treatment technology, as well as the wastewater treatment product developed in partnership with Garratt-Callahan, and (iii) the expansion of big engineering projects like the waste-to-energy conversion plant project in South America.""

He continued, ""It is also worth mentioning that our project to help a national nuclear fuel innovator develop prototype production systems is expected to expand over the coming months following a successful first phase of our contract."" You can read more about this project in the original press release, on the BLGO blog.

BioLargo generated approximately $1.3 million in company-wide revenue for the second quarter of 2022, representing a 37% increase compared with the first quarter of 2022, and a 185% increase compared with the second quarter of 2021. Note, however, that these revenue figures are preliminary, have not been reviewed and are subject to change pending review by the company's independent registered public accounting firm. The company will include its full results of operations in its quarterly report for the period ended June 30, 2022, due to be filed with the SEC by August 15, 2022. The company also intends to hold an investor webcast and conference call shortly after the filing of its quarterly report to discuss its financial results, and will provide details for participating in this event as soon as its available.

OP

Quarterly Revenues in Q2 Grew 37% Compared to Q1, and 185% Compared to Q2 of 2021

Pretty awesome update- It 100% shows we are on the right track and Pooph sales are just ramping up. If they just keep doing what they are doing we will all do very good- but as of today they have the best solutions for some of the biggest global water problems and big contracts are expected soon. 
It seems proven now that  Pooph is the “No downside insurance”. VERY pleased with the numbers. 
This already is a very explosive mixture - with many irons in the fire and a massive undervaluation- and it is just heating up some more..

https://s27.q4cdn.com/906368049/files/News/2022/Zacks_SCR_Research_06272022_MITI_Senko.pdf

Overview
Currently the company has 6 open clinics, 8 signed leases, 2 additional LOIs, and operations in two states (Minnesota and Colorado). The company also has an additional 12 jobs open for clinics (https://www.thegoodclinic.com/careers/ ) showing rapid expansion and one of the most experienced management teams in the OTC market hands down.

Healthcare is a rapidly growing field and is expected to keep growing at an exponential rate. By 2027, primary care is expected to be a $409 billion dollar market in the United States. Not only that, but MITI is also planning to utilize a telemedicine model. This includes following up with their patients 5-6 times a year through quick follow-up appointments.

Key Points
Providing primary care, preventive care, behavioral wellness, chronic disease management, immunizations, skin care, wellness planning, women’s health &amp;amp; virtual care
Leverages the nurse practitioner primary care clinic expertise
Target market: the 70% of people with average use of &amp;lt;$2k or less in healthcare

Residential amenity
Planned expansions – Not only is the good clinic planning on building roughly 40-50 clinics over the course of the next 3 years, they also plan to target retiring physicians and acquire their clinics at about the same time. This will cost approximately the same as building a clinic due to renovation costs. 

They are expanding their partnerships into markets where clinicians are older and nearing retirement. They currently have partnership with Lennar, an extremely large building corporation, and Colliers which are helping the expansion efforts by finding prime real estate for rapid clinic expansion.
Recently, per 8ks MITI Insiders have lended over $3million+ cash to the company to be repaid later. This is huge insider confidence! Bullish! 

MITI currently has 4 institutional investors onboard as of their S1.

• Accumulation of CSPGs is a fundamental response to nervous system damage, inhibits neural repair – PTPs binds to CSPGs and mediates inhibition of neural repair

• NVG-291 is a first-in-class PTPs mimetic that modulates the PTPs-CSPG mechanism

• Extensive data from multiple animal models of nervous system damage demonstrate improved recovery following treatment with NVG-291-R ‒ Promotes axonal regeneration, remyelination, plasticity

• Phase 1 SAD dosing in healthy subjects was well tolerated, with good pharmacokinetic properties – Exposures exceed the (human dose equivalent) target efficacy range from preclinical studies – Most common AE: injection site related events (all mild); no SAEs • MAD is ongoing – In MAD Cohort 1, NVG-291 was well tolerated when administered as a daily subcutaneous injection x 14 days ▪ Most common AE: injection site related events (all mild); no SAEs – Final MAD and CSF cohort results expected mid-2022

• Phase 1 study results will enable dose selection for Ph1b/2 trials starting in 2022 – Spinal cord injury – Alzheimer’s disease – Multiple sclerosis

t3_wf9pp0|1659540930|pennystocks|Opportunity in Patented Plastic Technology|"With the oceans awash in plastic litter, China cutting off its imports for plastic recycling, plastic manufacturing increasing to keep pace with rising demand, a concomitant rise in greenhouse gas emissions from plastic production, and highly inefficient recycling technologies currently in use, the plastics industry is definitely in need of a makeover. From the oil in the ground all the way through the ‘end’ of the plastic’s usable life, everything plastic needs to be rethought and retooled to become more efficient, less disposable, and more environmentally friendly.

A hyper-efficient, water-based recycling technology developed by [Aduro Clean Technologies Inc.](https://adurocleantech.com/) (CSE: ACT) (OTCQB: ACTHF) (FSE: 9D50) may be part of the answer. The Canadian microcap company is in the process of completing two pilot projects to prove its patented Hydrochemolytic™ platform technology (HCT) on a larger scale and with a continuous flow of production. HCT has been shown to be much more efficient than existing recycling technologies, turning about 85% of the original material into new usable stock compared to 50-60% returns from current methods.

**The Pilot Projects**

New technologies are developed on a small scale before being tested at increasingly larger magnitudes to work out the kinks and address any new problems that arise as a result of the scaling process. Companies can’t just make one widget and instantly jump to making 100,000 of them, and Aduro’s technology is no different.

With the HCT platform proven in small batch settings, Aduro [has partnered](https://adurocleantech.com/company-update/aduro-and-switch-energy-enter-into-loi-for-pilot-plant-and-waste-plastic-feedstock-supply/) with [Exergy Solutions](https://exergysolutions.com/) to design and build two pilot projects. One is in conjunction with Switch Energy Corp ([https://adurocleantech.com/company-update/aduro-and-switch-energy-enter-into-loi-for-pilot-plant-and-waste-plastic-feedstock-supply/](https://adurocleantech.com/company-update/aduro-and-switch-energy-enter-into-loi-for-pilot-plant-and-waste-plastic-feedstock-supply/))  and the pilot plant will be located in Ontario where Switch Energy is a leader in Canada’s agricultural and industrial plastic waste recycling industry. The second pilot project is underway in the Netherlands, in partnership with [Brightlands Chemelot Campus](https://www.brightlands.com/en/brightlands-chemelot-campus). Brightlands is an innovation hub focused on developing high-performance materials, sustainable processes, and biomedical solutions.

[Watch an interview with Exergy representatives discussing the two Aduro pilot projects:](https://youtu.be/EEWqgJAL1-Y) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEWqgJAL1-Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEWqgJAL1-Y)

Both projects will initially be capable of processing tons of stock per day, with plans to expand into larger capacities should the pilot prove to be a success. The ease of scalability and the wide variety of potential applications for HCT are hallmarks of the system. The technology can be very localized to decrease the cost and hassle of transporting plastic waste feedstock, and it can treat a broad range of types of plastics. The Switch project is initially focused on agricultural polyethylene prior to expanding into polypropylene and polystyrene. The Brightlands project is focused on polyethylene. HCT can even be used to upgrade heavy crude oil and bitumen into lighter crude more conducive to pipeline transportation, and to upgrade waste vegetable oils into renewable fuels and specialty chemicals.

The overall goal of these projects is to create a more sustainable, circular economy for plastics. Waste reduction, efficient and clean production of new plastics, and relatively low energy use are all benefits of the HCT platform. “Aduro HCT is a valuable addition to the innovative technologies that are being scaled up at Brightlands as part of the Chemelot Circular Hub. It offers benefits due to the low temperature process, high yield, lack of aromatics formation, and ability to use inexpensive feedstocks and catalysts,” adds Lucie Wenmakers, Business Development Manager at Brightlands.

**The Opportunity is Now**

The [global plastic recycling industry](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/10/2460685/0/en/Global-Plastic-Recycling-Market-to-Reach-47-3-Billion-by-2026.html#:~:text=The%20Plastic%20Recycling%20market%20in,share%20in%20the%20global%20market.) is expected to reach $47.3 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 6.1%. In the United States alone, plastic recycling accounted for $3.1 billion in 2021 ([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/10/2460685/0/en/Global-Plastic-Recycling-Market-to-Reach-47-3-Billion-by-2026.html#:\~:text=The%20Plastic%20Recycling%20market%20in,share%20in%20the%20global%20market](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/10/2460685/0/en/Global-Plastic-Recycling-Market-to-Reach-47-3-Billion-by-2026.html#:~:text=The%20Plastic%20Recycling%20market%20in,share%20in%20the%20global%20market).) The market opportunity is very large, especially considering that these numbers are based on the reality that somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% - 20% of all plastics are currently being recycled. Aduro’s technology opens the door to recycling plastics that are not in the current mix. HCT handles impurities very well, and operates at a much lower cost than today’s technologies. It has the potential to flip the economic considerations which limit the feasibility of recycling the 80% of plastics currently out of the market.

There is another dynamic at work as well. Through organizations like [The Global Commitment](https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/global-commitment/overview) and the [Plastics Pact Network](https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/the-plastics-pact-network), both spearheaded by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, there is an emerging global effort to greatly reduce the amount of plastic pollution by the year 2025. The Foundation reports that consumer brands accounting for 20% of global plastic production have signed on to the project, and the list is steadily growing. Combined with the multinational effort to limit emissions that contribute to global warming, there is a clear need for improved plastic recycling technologies like Aduro’s HCT.

Interested parties are encouraged to contact the company directly.

POTENTIAL INVESTOR DUE DILIGENCE PACKAGE
OTC: NUGN
What is NUGN?
Nugene was a shell company that was recently acquired by Livento Group as of 3/17/2022. Livento is a company that tries to align products and services with a market disrupting model and is currently involved in Ai, Eurodot, multiple Real estate projects that span internationally, and heavily involved in the film and television business with clients such as Netflix and Amazon. Livento has a movie production company called BOXO Productions that has been around for quite a while.

Why is BOXO Productions important?

The company was formulated for the purpose of producing and negotiating producing rights agreements to large film productions. This provides not only increased exposure to the company, but also acts as one of multiple revenue streams for the company as a whole.

Why should I invest in NUGN?

NUGN is in a unique position within the OTC Market. The plan is to eventually up list on a big board exchange such as the Nasdaq. NUGN supports a very attractive share structure and also currently has no open debt of any kind. It also is Net income positive.

Below are some of the selling points of this stock to take into consideration:
• Under 200 Million Shares in the public tradeable float of the stock.
• Under 250 Million Outstanding Shares.
• Producing net income with steady growth quarter over quarter.
• In the process of listing to the QB Market to gain more visibility and institutional support with a September up listing target. Also looking at the potential of a name change to further align us.
• A dedicated team of professionals with various different skill sets that complement each other.
• Multiple streams of potentially large revenue generation from different sectors such as:.

? Artificial Intelligence: Working on an Investment portfolio analysis tool for large corporations and hedge funds specifically companies on the DAX (European Stock Exchange Index)
? Real Estate Projects: Our company has several projects Internationally. There are several properties in the portfolio like apartment complexes and hotels that will add recurring revenues for per unit sales.
? Movie Productions: BOXO discussed above also provides revenue potential for payments collected at various stages of production.

How can I as a shareholder count on Livento Group?

The CEO recently said in an interview ""We are looking to create out of Livento, a billion-dollar company. We want it to succeed. We want it to be big and large. And we know that with our AI tool and with our movies (BOXO Productions), we are able to reach it."" -David Stybr CEO

The company has an aggressive and driven team that has a straight line objective to increasing shareholder value. One of those examples is decreasing the authorized shares. The current is 800 Million authorized shares, but the company plans to reduce this number by at least 300 Million in the near future. This alone shows a great step of protecting shareholder value. Livento tries to update their follower base and you can follow them on Twitter at @LiventoG. Going back to BOXO, a new film is being released called: Medieval starring Ben Foster and Michael Caine.

Good morning All – In light of recent developments and the press conference this afternoon: [""Xeriant Press Conference""](http://www.xeriant.com/august-2022-press-conference) : I wanted to share some information on a company ( $XERI ) I’ve been following for over a year now and wanted to summarize its PR’s for a specific product line they’ve been developing during this time

On top of this product, Xeriant has also signed a JV agreement and has contributed over $5.5m to XTI aircraft to help design and bring to market the worlds fastest and longest range vTOL aircraft that has over $3b in pre-orders: [XTI Aircraft](https://www.xtiaircraft.com/xti-triFan-600). XTI &amp; $XERI signed a letter of intent to pursue a merger on 9/22/21.

Lets get into it.

Movychem is a Slovakian based company that Xeriant has recently signed a 50/50 JV with to market their products globally.

Xeriant-MovyChem's eco-friendly product called Retacell®, is poised to disrupt the global flame retardant/resistance market which is forecasted to reach $4.5T by 2030. They (Movychem) have over 20 years of R&amp;D invested in Retacell which has an unlimited number of applications. Just to name a few:

· Plastics, textiles, wood-derived composite materials, powder coatings and carbon fiber.

· Engine, wiring, structural and interior components of flight vehicles, including the insulation of batteries utilized in electric aircraft propulsion systems.

· Thermoplastics and foams used in aircraft cabin interiors, for floors, ceilings, wall panels and seats.

· Global vehicle interiors markets, including aircraft and automobiles, as well as construction materials.

· Fire protection properties of various building materials.

· Foams, sealants, fillers, adhesives as well as textiles

The list goes on and on. What is a bit unclear to everyone however is ""Where are they currently at with testing and getting this product on the market?"". As you can see below, the evolution of PR's mention testing quite a few times and more recently have started to mention negotiations with buyers.

When they say ""Initial testing"", are they referring to:

1. Intital testing done in 2021 to see what Retacell can even be applied to?

2. Initial testing on specific applications that they know Retacell can be applied to and are now checking their flammability resistance?

3. Initial testing of its flammability resistance to meet ASTM standards and are now moving towards meeting a companies specific requirements (above and beyond code acceptance to set themselves apart from the competition).

Here are the main points in the PR’s from the past year.

**4/1/21**:

• Movychem is in the process of initiating testing on Retacell treated plastics, textiles, wood-derived materials and carbon fiber.  

 • To achieve certification, Movychem plans to work with aircraft materials suppliers, component manufacturers and major airframe manufacturers to produce the safest and most durable materials, with the goal of exceeding all fire, smoke and toxicity requirements according to Federal Aviation Regulations.

**4/22/21**:

• Retacell, Movychem’s fire protection product, is in the process of being tested and evaluated for specific certification designations and is being field tested by leading global manufacturers.  

 • “as part of the initial testing phase for Movychem’s fire protection technology, we’ve been asked to remanufacture plastics, wood-based composites and powder coatings in our facilities in the Czech Republic to demonstrate our ability to deliver cost effective green solutions that exceed current U.S. fire retardant thresholds”  

 • “The product pipeline currently being tested by globally recognized corporations will allow Xeriant to gain the recognition needed to bring these new high-demand advanced materials and technologies to market”

**6/30/21**:

• Announced today the appointment of Dave Zajac to the Company’s Advisory Board, effective immediately. Zajac will play an important role in the testing, certification and commercialization of newly sourced advanced materials and chemicals.  

 • Xeriant is in active discussions with companies to execute long-term contracts to purchase Movychem’s Retacell™ fire protectant, as soon as the products are certified in accordance with U.S. standards

**4/4/22**:

• Xeriant enter into Definitive Agreement with Movychem on Retacell Fire Retardant Technology

• The definitive agreement establishes a U.S.-based partnership between Xeriant and Movychem, structured as a 50/50 joint venture, which has acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to the internationally patented, eco-friendly Retacell® fire retardant technology and is responsible for developing applications and commercializing products derived from Retacell®. The establishment of the joint venture is the culmination of several months of negotiations, which included a series of meetings in December 2021 held in the Czech Republic.

**5/26/22**:

• It has completed the critical pre-certification testing of its eco-friendly Retacell® flame retardant on synthetic fabrics  

 • In initial tests, Retacell has been successfully applied to the polymeric material in the finishing process as a surface treatment spray

**6/08/22**:

• announced today the successful development of a multi-purpose, high-strength fire- and water-resistant composite panel made from a formulation of Retacell**®** and a cardboard fiber-reinforced polymeric resin, which can be sourced from recycled materials.

•The panel is fabricated through a compression molding process and may be produced or cut in varying thicknesses and sizes, including standard 48” x 96” sheets. Depending on the application, the panel can have different colors, textures or decorative finishes. Potential interior and exterior construction applications include walls, ceilings, flooring, framing, siding, roofing, and decking. The Company is planning to license the technology to major manufacturers of building products

**6/27/22**:

• Xeriant has received substantial interest in the Company’s eco-friendly flame retardant, Retacell® from homebuilding and textile industry leaders. The management team has scheduled in-person meetings and demonstrations across the U.S. to advance discussions and unlock both near-term and future revenue.

• The Company completed the critical pre-certification testing of its eco-friendly Retacell**®** flame retardant on polymer-based textiles, which are found in mattresses, carpeting, upholstery, and filtration products. Recently, the EU took steps to ban up to 12,000 toxic substances, including flame retardant chemicals, driving the demand for eco-friendly alternatives like Retacell®, and several U.S. states have followed suit.

• The Company successfully developed and tested a multi-purpose, high-strength fire- and water-resistant composite panel made from a formulation of Retacell**®** and a cardboard fiber-reinforced polymeric resin, which can be sourced from recycled materials. Samples of the panels are being presented to major homebuilders for interior and exterior construction applications, including walls, ceilings, flooring, framing, siding, roofing, and decking.

**7/11/22**:

• Xeriant has been meeting with multiple interested end users from the building and textiles industries, with discussions that include advanced negotiations, and is taking steps to scale up production, finalizing testing and certifications, evaluating processing equipment, sourcing bulk raw material suppliers, and setting up a North American pilot manufacturing facility.

**8/3/22**:

• Press conference for the purpose of announcing recent significant positive developments

Now, we have seen a global initiative towards ""carbon net zero"" via manufacturing, transportation and infrasturcture. Couple in the rising cost of building materials (20.3% year over year since the pandemic).

This move by Xeriant to JV with MovyChem was brilliant. If these products live up to their potential, Xeriant-Movychem will be in ""pole position"" to leverage Retacell infused materials for this exact purpose.

**---------------------------UPDATE POST PRESS CONFERENCE-------------------------------**

After watching the presentation, I took down a few notes that I thought were relevant. I will separate them by speaker.

**Ted DeFeudis, Xeriant Director** –

• Extended the Auctus loan (which was taken out to pay the $5.5m to XTI) until November. 8-k was filed after market close today https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001481504/000147793222005599/xeri_8k.htm

• Pushing for an uplist to NASDAQ by end of the year

• Pursue significant revenue generation in 2023


**Brig. General (Ret.) Blaine Holt, Xeriant Senior Advisor** –

• Strong belief in Xeriant

• May take on a more significant role in the near future

• Reviewing technologies to enable smart protyping, manufacturing, anti-counterfeiting, counter cyber attack &amp; cutting edge supply chain risk management with block chain provenance. These technologies could fit into Xeriants long term strategy and create substantial value for share holders


**Mike Hinderberger, XTI CEO** –

• Xeriant contributed $5.5m to help XTI complete a major FAA milestone, preliminary design review. Validated the configuration and engineering of the TF600 that it will perform as intended based on the aerodynamics, structural arrangement, flight mechanics and many other design features.

• In the process of expanding our relationship and creating a world class aviation company. Look forward to our future with Xeriant and obtaining certification of the TF600

• Over $3b in Pre-Orders for the TriFan600

• Anticipating production and deliveries starting mid 2027


**Martin Stloukal, Head of Xeriant/MovyChem JV** –

• Directing the R&amp;D team to support Xeriants commercialization of Retacell products

• Network of leading chemists who are involved with the analysis, testing &amp; certification of these products

• Engineered a flame retardant &amp; water-resistant panel made from retacell, recycled plastics and recycled cardboard fibers. The board has been well received by major homebuilders with potential to replace drywall, OSB, plywood and other construction products in certain applications

• Also working on textile application to use retacell in caulking adhesives

• Working with Center of Polymer Systems at Tomas Bata University in Czech Republic http://www.cps.utb.cz/en for Retacell infused plastic products

• Working with the Faculty of Forestry and wood technology at Mendelu University in Czech Republic https://ldf.mendelu.cz/en/?psn=0 for Retacell infused wood products


**Dave Zajac, Xeriant Managing Director of Advanced Chemicals and Materials Division** –

• Developing the commercial applications of Retacell fire retardant products

• Most impressive so far is a game changing wall board panel that is fire, water, mold and insect resistant and can be used in the residential construction market as a replacement for drywall and various wood products

• This retacell infused eco-friendly wallboard was recently introduced into the building product segment with great success. Last week visited manufacturing, testing and certification facilities in eastern Europe to formulate our plan for U.S based manufacturing to meet customer demand

• The wallboard is the first major Retacell product to gain commercial acceptance but there will be many more applications to come as they continue to work with various companies in the home building textile, automotive and aerospace market.


**Keith Duffy, Xeriant CEO** –

• Planning to manufacture Retacell infused boards in the U.S to meet demand, which will be subject to Xeriant raising sufficient capital.

• Recently signed a LOI with https://www.nextnewconcept.com/ . Innovator and environmentally friendly quickly constructed building systems for affordable quality housing. If Xeriant can ramp up manufacturing and fill the order, the boards will be used in the construction of tens of thousands of homes for walls, ceilings, roofing and subfloors. It could generate well over $100m of revenue for Xeriant over 5 years. This is just the first order

• Several other national and multinational companies are in the process of testing retacell for use in various plastic, textile and wood based applications

• Continue to negotiate with XTI aircraft to consummate a merger. The transaction will be subject to a number of conditions including the completion of due diligence, the execution of a definitive agreement and regulatory approval. Therefore no guarantee can be made that they will complete the acquisition.

• Xeriant is engaged with an investment bank to effectuate an uplist to NASDAQ which will require a capital raise and regulatory approval

There's lots of information to take in. It would seem that Retacell is the main focus for Xeriant. The merger with XTI is being worked on but there is no guarantee. Atleast we know that it isn't dead in the water.

https://preview.redd.it/pf7s518wucf91.png?width=372&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1f598b7a328dddcabb19b279fc2bc0da30b2cbf

And that is pretty much the only way that the Company resembles a standard miner and producer. The reality is that LMS has developed a system that funds its operations without the traditional massive dilution junior miners are known for when raising funds. And they work and have worked with big global metals companies like Anglo American and Barrick.

So far, LMS seems a well-kept secret. That will likely change fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gs5bvedxucf91.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fe20070cb356b44f2e233f3e14e48288529b17b

***Nota Bene****:*

*LMS operates on a prospect generator model, focusing on acquiring prospective exploration properties at minimum cost, followed by initial evaluation through the cost-effective exploration to establish drill targets. Latin Metals ultimately secures joint venture partners to fund drilling and advanced exploration and, in doing so, exposes shareholders to the upside of mineral discoveries while conserving capital and minimizing dilution. (*Corporate website)

Many Exploration deals are smoke and mirrors with little chance of success. Latin metals have an established time that signs consistent deals with Major Mining companies like AngloGold &amp; Barrick.

\-  Dilution is minimized in Prospect Generator Business.

\-   Models such as option payments come in, and Royalties from mines flow to the balance sheet. 

\-  Current agreements for up to $30 million of non-dilutive investment in Latin Metals and its project

\-  3rd Party Companies help validate the property's potential feasibility

Rick Rule; *The idea is that the exploration business is very much like any other form of research and development business and that the principal value is actually the intellectual capital of the management team—the idea being, with an exploration company, that you share the financial risk of developing a project so that you don't dilute the shares. You don't, as an investor, cut your interest in the intellectual capital, which is the most valuable asset that many of these small companies have. (Full article* [*here*](https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2020/02/16/the-argument-in-favor-of-prospect-generators.html)*.)*

The preceding piece is, in true Rule style, a straightforward and easy-to-understand structure and his own personal success in investing in these companies, both statistically and from a profit point of view.

The mining magic happens in Peru and Argentina. Let’s dig into the recent announcement of the Company’s high-grade copper mineralization at its Aquis Project.

Keith Henderson, a CEO, commented, ""Our recent follow-up sampling program has outlined a large 1km x 1km area of consistent mineralization where 101 samples returned copper values of up to 2.37% copper and 236 ppm molybdenum, with a mean value of 0.13% copper and 6.4 ppm molybdenum. We are excited about these initial results, with many areas of this large 4,000-hectare property still unsampled.”

""AngloGold's investment of up to USD 12.575 million for a 75% ownership interest in the Projects is a significant investment, and, if AngloGold were to exercise its top-up right for an aggregate 80% ownership, additional investments by AngloGold  would include delivery of a Mineral Resource estimate and further cash payments commensurate with defined ounces to Latin Metals.”

Mr. Henderson added, ""I am particularly pleased to have concluded this agreement so soon after completing a similar deal with Barrick Gold Corporation in February. Securing high-quality, technically excellent, and financially capable partners is essential to our prospect generator model. We hope to conclude other deals as we continue to market our project portfolio.""

The Projects are in Salta Province, in northwest Argentina: Latin Metals currently holds a 100% interest in each project. The Projects are located within the Argentine Puna region, the southern extension of the Altiplano of southern Peru.

**Bottom Line**

The age-old question is, should a mine be run as a mine or a business that uses management expertise to monetize properties using, to a large extent, OPM and deliver lasting value for shareholders. (Not age-old, I just made it up). Relevant, nonetheless.

The other factor that should intrigue risk investors is the fact that LMS is kind of orphaned out there with an average daily volume of just over 10k, a market cap of 20% over CDN$5million and a raft of relevant news regarding decent funding deals it has done to grow the Company; and eventually deliver what appears to be a good shot at decent investor returns. Hell, if it moves from here to even shy of CDN$0.20 a share, that's about a 100% potential return. And at this level, they are not likely to tie up even a meaningful amount of investment capital.

This means that due to process and management savvy, it may eventually become a meaningful amount of investment capital.

And besides, anything that has cool moves in what tends to be a reasonably pedantic sector? All over it."|0.67|1|0|1

Last week they showed 65% repair of damage from stroke in mice, that has never happened before, actual repair.  A buzz may start from this tomorrow, we will see. 

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - August 2, 2022) - **NervGen Pharma Corp., (TSXV: NGEN) (OTCQX: NGENF),** a clinical stage biotech company dedicated to developing a first-in-class neuroreparative drug to treat nervous system damage, will present the study design for its upcoming Phase 1b/2a Alzheimer's disease clinical trial at the 2022 Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) on August 3, 2022. NervGen's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Daniel Mikol, will present a poster summarizing unblinded data from the single ascending dose (SAD) cohort of the study and interim blinded data from the multiple ascending dose (MAD) portion of the study, and for the first time will introduce the study design for the upcoming Phase 1b/2a trial of NervGen's lead drug candidate, NVG-291, in subjects with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.

Dr. Mikol stated, ""I am very excited about sharing our trial design at AAIC. Importantly, it was developed with substantial input from our distinguished [Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Advisory Board](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/oJ5w5UNOgR) which is comprised of leading physicians and researchers in Alzheimer's disease.""

I'm excited about playing a part in testing this drug in patients so we can determine if the repair mechanisms such as increased plasticity, axonal regeneration and remyelination results in favorable effects in Alzheimer's disease patients.""

Paul Brennan, NervGen's President &amp; CEO, stated, ""NVG-291 has significant potential to repair the damage from this relentlessly progressive disease. Given the unique mechanism of NVG-291, we believe we have an opportunity to see changes in imaging biomarkers in this trial, which has been designed to give us the best opportunity to detect efficacy in Alzheimer's patients."""|0.78|10|0|10

t3_weed5b|1659453439|pennystocks|Merger plays are coming back to life and I think this is going to be round 2 of what began in 2021|"Late 2020 into 2021 was the most profitable and explosive phase I've seen in 16 years of trading the OTC markets. Many of the plays were custodianship plays, ala Frank and Alpharidge, but it wasn't limited to just them. The overarching themed seemed to be reverse mergers, with old shells getting cleaned up in an attempt to find a company to merge with. During this phase any and all shells would run quite hard with any signs of getting current with the OTC, cleaning up their s/s, and basically any sign that pointed to them seeking out a merger candidate. 

All that hype died off by the end of 2021 and 2022 has been the year of gut wrenching shake outs, not just in the OTC but in the crypto markets and big boards as well. Fast forward to today and I believe that we're in the early stages of part 2 of what began back in 20/21. Now we're seeing actual mergers begin to happen and since most of these stocks have been sold off and shaken out, they're very ripe for bullish momentum to return. Stonks don't make the big moves when everyone is long and bullish already, they make those moves when everyone has moved on and dumb/fast money has sold into the few hands of the smart/patient money. And that's where I think we are with many of these OTC merger plays. I think the hype is beginning to return and the bulls are getting more confident. The moves we're starting to see, like $EMGE, $WLAN, $TXTM etc. will need to prove they can consolidate and hold some of their gains, before trying to move higher still. 

I think there's a lot of promise if these plays can move back up to retest their 2021 highs (not all but most of them made large moves last year), but the real fun comes when those long term highs are broken and they start to move onto new blue skies. That's when/where you'll see the mania return and the hype get crazy. If we indeed see continuation breakouts on many/most of these merger plays that began to wake up last year, then the upside implications are huge. I can't promise that's what's happening, but I think there's a lot evidence pointing in this direction, ie the charts look to be trending in that direction and the sentiment is perfect for bullish moves. 

I've got a watchlist of about 30 or 40 merger plays, though I'm only loosely following their stories. I try to follow the charts more than anything and keep tabs on what's starting to move, what's starting to get volume, and which ones have the best long term charts going  for them. The most active on that list (as of today) are $EMGE $GSFI $WLAN $IFXY $CZNI $TXTM $IGEX $ILST $PDGO $SYSX $ELRA $PLPL $DVLP $ICNM $JPEX $ILIM $XCPL $SRNW $NOUV $FCGD $NUVG $MNDP $HDUP $TMXN and there's more if anyone is interested in the very thin/low volume ones.

In no way is this a recommendation to blindly jump in any of these, nor am I saying there are good investments here. I think it's best to compile a list of OTC merger plays and then watch them like a hawk. I believe we'll see more and more evidence of runners emerging and longer term continuation breakouts play off of the 2021 runs, and if that's the case then there's going to be money to be made here on the same level as what we saw in early 2021, if not even better.

I am long a few of these shells/ potential merger plays, $OCLG, $ILIM, $NHLG $ADMG and $ASKH. My favorite chart out of all of the shells and merger plays is $ILIM, fwiw. It's blue sky breakout level is in the low .004s, which is only a hop skip and a jump away from where it currently sits. Their merger is already seemingly being carried out and news is due this week and beyond. There's already a good amount of capital flowing into these OTC merger plays and that one looks absolutely primed imo. Take all this with a grain of salt, obviously, but if nothing else I highly recommend keeping tabs on these mergers and when/if they really pop off, you'll thank me. One last tip, a twitter search for the words 'OTC merger' can help you find tickers that fall into this category. Good luck and I'm happy to answer questions."|0.85|16|0|16

&gt;  
&gt;Pacific Energy Network (PEN) is a California based parent company of several subsidiary LLC's that manage solar, roofing, HVAC, security, distribution, consulting, lead generation, marketing, sales, data, software and mortgage divisions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Founded in 2016, PEN has quickly become one of the largest and most successful home services companies in the nation with a footprint across multiple states. With a focus on customer satisfaction and strategic business planning, PEN has grown into a multi-product business that has increased revenue year over year and expanded its reach into new markets across the United States.

I don't know very much about PEN, but I've been holding HVCW since December. Here's a few things to note about the current ticker:

* No debts, no convertible notes. A true shell.
* 6,000,000,000 outstanding shares with 25,000,000 authorizing shares.
* Notable dilution. Outstanding shares has increased 1,000,000,000 over the past year.
* The current 'CEO' is Jeff Canouse, who is very controversial. He's handled a number of these shell companies and reverse mergers, and some of them went belly up while others sky rocketed.

Upon releasing their Q1 results in May shares came crashing down - more than halving in value over the space of two days. The price further slumped over the next months, with prices currently trading at CAD$0.75 (01 August 2022).

Despite revenue beating most expectations with CAD$41.2m, investors were spooked at losses worsened to (CAD$18m) - nearly doubling from last year's quarter loss of (CAD$10m).

The net margin for Q1 was a loss of (43.9%), lower than last year's quarter loss of (47.6%).

Xebec haven't always been loss making - in the final quarter of 2021 they earned CAD$2.42 on record revenue of CAD$46m - as well as CAD$2.02m for FY19.

Total cash levels had been incrementally declining to CAD$24m, down from CAD$100m in last year's quarter - leaving investors worried about how Xebec would raise further cash and the risk of dilution or increasing debt levels amidst interest rate rises.

Total assets were CAD$464m, which was up from CAD$419m in last year's quarter - but were down from record levels of $497m as of 31 Dec 2021.

Total debt was CAD$83m - representing a current liquidity margin of 17.9% (compared to last years quarter of 13.1%).

Xebec's balance sheet has been growing considerably over the last few operating years, with the 2020 trading year taking assets levels up to elevated heights. The liquidity margin was 12.8% in FY20 and 17.7% in FY21.

**NervGen has already regenerated human neurons under the microscope and neurons in live rats with severed spinal cords. The rats regained most of the function in paralyzed legs.**

**The market cap of NervGen is just over $100 million. It is currently in Phase 1 FDA trials in humans and is about to go into Phase 2.** 

**NervGen has exclusive rights to the technology from Case Western University. It is backed by top experts in the field and staffed by very high-level pharma executives.** 

**It has no competitors that can repair damage to the nervous system. If it works 50% as well in humans as in animals, a $15 billion market cap is feasible.**

# NervGen Regenerates Neurons, What Is A Drug That Reverses Paralysis, MS, Stroke And Alzheimer's Worth?

One doctor that has weighed in on that was interviewed about NervGen and sees them the same as I do. It is Dr. Mark Swaim, founder of BioPub. He has made it the largest position in his portfolio and says it is the best drug stock investment he has ever seen. That video is below. It is cued to where he talks about NervGen. Like me he thinks it can 100 bag.

The long-term trends that have made the sector an outperformer in the market over the past five years remain in place. Biotechnology stocks continue to maintain a strong pace amid phase trials, new leadership and big investments from insiders. The regulatory environment in the U.S. also leans in favor of biotechnology, with the Food and Drug Administration offering fast-track approval for some breakthrough drugs, especially those targeting rare diseases. Let’s get into the winners in the sector.

As a pharmaceutical firm creating a platform for biologically-guided ExoTherapy, NurExone Biologic (TSXV:NRX) has recently been listed on the TSX Venture Exchange. The effectiveness of therapy for neuronal damage may be impacted by the lengthy and intricate series of subsequent events that occur after the initial lesion. This still represents a significant unmet need for creating a novel strategy that is practical, safe, and effective. 

Patients with traumatic spinal cord injuries are the main target of the minimally invasive Exotherapy that Nurexon is developing. ExoTherapy will use unique exosomes (membrane-bound extracellular vesicles) as biologically-guided nanocarriers to transport tailored therapeutic substances to target organs. The healing process is induced at the target region by the therapeutic chemicals' promotion of a biochemical environment. ExoTherapy has proven incredibly successful in its conceptual demonstration in animal research.

NurExone is transfering the treatment to humans, and the company holds an exclusive worldwide license from the Technion for the development and commercialization of the exosome technology. With the treatments they are developing, and growth they have already overcome in this untouched sector, they will be the leading company in development of novel, biologic and minimal-invasive treatment for spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries.

Many biotech companies are conducting phase trials, working on new initiatives, and some have only recently started to make money off of their action plans. The attractiveness of small cap companies has received a lot of attention lately as the mergers and acquisitions market heats up.

t3_wdgy95|1659358930|pennystocks|$ALRT will at MINIMUM double from $0.045 to $0.09 in 30 days or I will ban myself until it does. Could be a 5x-10x within 4 weeks depending on partnership news.|"ALR Technologies ($ALRT) is a diabetes management company releasing the worlds first and only Continuous Glucose Monitor for diabetic pets.  They have been working on **a partnership with one of the largest animal health companies in the world** and it will be completed any day now. They put out a press release today that said they are extending the closing date for their distribution partnership to August 31st due to delays with their partner scheduling with patients. BUT. They are putting in their **first purchase order for units to be sold in October** anyway, which shows we will get a major partnership announcement any day over the next 4 weeks in my opinion.

Link to todays press release and their new investor deck is on their website [https://www.alrt.com/investors](https://www.alrt.com/investors)

$ALRT has a 109,000,000 float of publicly traded shares which only equals $5 million right now, they have a bunch of restricted shares held by insiders that cant be traded so the O/S is 550 million shares. They are fully SEC reporting and trade on the higher tier of OTC stocks called the QB. They are not pink sheets junk.

They also announced in their letter to shareholders (and PRs) that they are applying for NYSE American (AMEX) listing in the near future which points to the amount of sales/earnings they believe they will make with the pet CGM.

There are 7 potential partners in my opinion, 4 are pharmaceutical companies and 3 are global distributors. All of them are huge billion dollar companies.

**Potential Partners 2021 Revenues:**

Zoetis: $7.8 Billion (**Pharmaceutical company**)

Merck Animal Health: $5.6 Billion (**Pharmaceutical company**)

Elanco: $4.7 Billion (**Pharmaceutical company**)

MWI: $4-6 Billion - not directly reported through parent company (**Global Distributor**)

Covetrus: $4.6 Billion (**Global Distributor**)

Boehringer Ingelheim: $4.3 Billion (**Pharmaceutical company**)

Patterson: $3.6 Billion (**Global Distributor**)

**Market Size for pet CGMs:**

Google pet population and you’ll see that there are close to 100,000,000 dogs and 100,000,000 cats in the USA alone based on surveys. Google diabetic pet population and you’ll find the most quoted peer reviewed research paper says 1-in-300 dogs and 1-in-230 cats have diabetes which gives you over 800,000 diabetic pets in the US. Europe is equal in size bringing the total to well over 1,600,000 diabetic pets not including the rest of the world. There are also many peer reviewed studies that show diabetes rates in cats up to 2% instead of the .43% in this calculation, these are all very low and very conservative numbers that don’t include prediabetic pets either.

**Earnings Potential for pet CGM:**

ALRT hired a firm to conduct market research and released the highlights stating newly diagnosed pets would need 2 or more units initially and then about 3 a year for maintenance. I asked my vet and he said that sounds correct to him. If on averages diabetic pets use even 3 per year, and they have even 1 million of the 1.6 million diabetic pets in the US and EU using them that would be 3,000,000 units sold a year.

At a $10 profit per unit that would be $30,000,000 a year in earnings, at a $20 it would be $60,000,000 a year in earnings, and so on and so on.

Let me remind you that the tradable float has a market cap of $5,000,000 and the O/S is $27,000,000. Meaning if they can make even $10 in profit per unit they would be trading at under a 1 times P/E multiple.

**How could they capture the market that quickly?**

The only other way to check blood sugar readings is to draw blood using a lancet, put the blood on a test strip and insert it into a blood glucose meter (BGM). You can’t do this with dogs and cats because only their ears and paws can be used and its very difficult to get enough blood. So you can’t monitor their blood sugar at home you have to drop them off at a veterinary clinic for 12 hours and the veterinarian will draw blood with a needle every 2 hours to create a graph called a blood glucose curve which shows the 12 hour graph of how the blood sugar reacts to the insulin injection.

Obviously this is as bad as it sounds, its time consuming for the staff, the animals get angry and try to bite/scratch, and apparently it makes the blood sugar levels go up from stress so they are less accurate. My vet said a lot of veterinarians wont even do them and will either refer them to another clinic (he gets referrals) or just go off best guess based on clinical signs which is why the lifespan is so low for diabetic animals. 

**FYI:**

I have been accumulating shares for a long time, so I have done a ton of research and ask my vet questions every time I see him. Everything here can be confirmed with the smallest amount of research.

ALRT shares are not traded on robinhood, you need a real broker account like etrade, fidelity, TD ameritrade, Charles, or one of those.

Also yes, obviously it’s a low volume stock but I believe that will all change very soon with partnership news followed by sales in October."|0.8|68|0|68

Today I wanted to take a look at the Ichimoku Cloud Chart of $DTC, the Ichimoku Cloud is one of the most reliable technical tools existing. As with any other technical analysis tools, you have to interpret them in context and use multiple different indicators. I urge you to do your own research, this analysis contains my personal view, if you are familiar with Ichimoku trading leave me in the comments, what you think and how you would approach it. The Ichimoku Cloud was developed in the late 1930s by Goichi Hosoda and has since proven to give a good overview of the current state of a stock, as well as confirming trend and/or trend reversals.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Ichimoku Chart overview of $DTC, showing a long downward trend on the verge of turning bullish.](https://preview.redd.it/hz0im4cce3f91.png?width=1051&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfd29e6eae26b11e2afa1f20b1b62397715e30ed)

The Ichimoku Cloud covers several different metrics at once and I will try to explain the basic concept for those who aren't familiar with it. There are multiple lines, that can be used to interpret a graph and the more of them align, the higher is the predictive power of given Ichimoku Chart.

First of all lets take a look at the Cloud, it consists out of 2 diffrent lines, in between the ""Cloud is formed:

[$VTNR chart for example purpose.](https://preview.redd.it/hvvatqt433f91.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8659758840ce4fca4d09923e55fe1a93ad16e1ed)

The Cloud can be either red or green, a red color signals a downward trend, while a green Cloud represents a bullish trend, the thickness of any given Cloud represents the trend strength itself. Stocks that are trading above the Cloud for an extended period of time are considered to be bullish, while stocks trading below the cloud are considered to be bearish. The Cloud is always leading the share price by a 30 period time frame and is used to forecast stock movement in advance.

Here is a close up of the $DTC chart, the Ichimoku Cloud consist out of 5 indicators, each used to create a bigger picture regarding the current price action. I will go into detail, what the current set up indicates according to Ichimoku Cloud trading and how it can be used to make better decisions:

[Purple Line = Base Line \(26 Day Moving Average\); Blue line = Short term trend \(9 Day Moving Average\); Orange Line = Lagging indicator, Red and Green \\""Cloud lines\\""](https://preview.redd.it/czkm7jye63f91.png?width=1059&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74bd394acb17776fb08382601d93a7fedf572f9f)

The ichimoku Cloud creates various trading signals differing in strength and reliability, the more of them align at once, the more reliable the conclusion will be. Let me note at this point, that there are no 100% correct trading strategies and unforeseeable events can happen, the trick is, to find trading patterns, that outperform the market in the long run, over many many repetitions. Key to successful trading is the right risk/benefit and money management, I bring this stock to you, because I think $DTC has an outstanding risk/reward ratio right now and offers a great trading opportunity. With that out of the way lets get down into the nitty gritty.

In this analysis I want to go step by step through the different indicators, explain what they mean and what we want to see, in order to find the best entry points.

* If we take a look at the purple Base line and blue short-term trend line, we can see that the current share price is above those lines, which is the first bullish sign we identify.
* Also, we want the Blue short term trend line to be above the purple mid-term trend line, we can see, that they are aligned at exactly the same level of 4.66$ right now, but because the blue line represents the short-term trend, it will move faster towards the current share price, so we can safely assume it crosses the purple trend line from below, which is also a bullish sign. For more confirmation, we can look at todays price actions, if share price stays above 4.66$ we are fine.
* Edge-to-Edge Signal: According to the theory behind Ichimoku Cloud trading, the share price will move from one side of the cloud to the other, once the share price moves into the cloud. A cross from below means, that the share price should move until the upper Cloud line, were we will find some resistance. The upper Cloud line is currently located at 5.50$. A breakout above that line is one of the best confirmations of an bearish trend turning bullish and has yet to be seen.

[Example of an Edge-to-Edge movement through the cloud with subsequent break out.](https://preview.redd.it/fs93h6bld3f91.png?width=1046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99bbd6a2cb94e5f2edbd981f0b9e74b276488874)

* The lagging indictor (orange line) is another trend confirmation indicator, which signals bullish price action while moving above current share price and vice versa. Currently its sitting right at 4.99$, the last closing price, so todays price action will give us another important factor to evaluate.
* Last but not least, one of the best signs of trend reversal is the so called ""Kumo Twist"", which is the point at which the green Cloud line crosses the Red Cloud line from below and turns the cloud color greenish.

[The light green line crossing the red line will turn the cloud green and imply a bullish trend reversal.](https://preview.redd.it/0tnkfr0mf3f91.png?width=1051&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4e017cfa866141bac798525c06046100f64f379)

As with the lagging orange line, this indicator is on the verge of turning bullish right now, so we have to pay attention to the next couple of days. 

All in All, many indicators are signaling a trend reversal and the moment we see the last two mentioned indicators turn bullish, it signals a really great entry point for $DTC. In general the stock is very undervalued, when looking at Price-to-earnings, Price-to-Sales and Price-to-earnings growth ratio.

The chart is currently forming a great set up right before earnings on Aug. 11th, in anticipation of quarterly results. The CEO and CFO of $DTC bought 130k shares of $DTC in Q2, which is another great sign and $AMZN earnings, a general measure for consumer spending and consumer discretionary stocks performed much better then expected.

Keeping a close eye on $DTC right now could offer a great trading opportunity, as the stock is also highly shorted, which increases the likelihood and intensity of bullish upward momentum.

t3_wd7c48|1659325342|pennystocks|$LTRY is probably worth more than 30 cents.|"LTRY is a an online lottery ticket service that went public through a SPAC merger in 2021.  It traded as high as $17.50 at the time of merger and had PTs in the $16 range.

After a series of blunders and terrible news LTRY is sitting at 30 cents as of Fridays close.  The key pieces of news that have pushed it this low over the last few weeks are:

July 6:  Company terminated the CFO

July 15: Chief Revenue Officer Resigned, Company disclosed that $30M of revenue they recognized in Q3 2021 (and resulting unrestricted cash) was improperly identified.  This may be because the services associated with that $30M had not yet been performed.

July 22: CEO Resigns.  Company informs that previous financial statements should not be relied upon while they are performing an audit.

July 29: Company informs they have insufficient resources to meet payroll and may need to furlough some employees.

Not gonna lie, this is a lot of bad news.  But there could be a silver lining here:

First and foremost, some of these oversold/near BK trades just work on their own.  Think TUEM, ELMS, others had 100% moves off the bottom.  So LTRY is interesting for that possibility on it's own.  Eventually the shorts have to cover even if they won the trade and that can get crowded fast.

That said, what does LTRY actually have:

\- In May Q1 earnings, LTRY had about $100M in current assets.  Even if you assume the cash doesn't exist, they had A/R of $36M and prepaid expenses of &gt; $12M. Possible value here.

&amp;#x200B;

[Q1 Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/bnrs74kos0f91.png?width=3306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f4965095adb32cae03963dc2dbdc64076782b80)

\- In the same report, they only had liabilities of \~$10M

https://preview.redd.it/sum97vnvs0f91.png?width=3293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb9bba54c31633da48ee9a8da595f980ab5853d4

So, above you might back into something in the \~$40M range even if you assume the cash does not even exist.

Beyond this, LTRY owns:

\- [Sports.com](https://Sports.com) (Paid $6M for this website, potentially more valuable now)

\- [Lottery.com](https://Lottery.com) (Got a steal &lt; $1M for this but likely worth similar to [sports.com](https://sports.com)).

&amp;#x200B;

[It really is coming soon, right?](https://preview.redd.it/jkboo0nzv0f91.png?width=1865&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a7a53369561a59efa1029612ddd907b30d90c41)

So, these 2 domains alone may be worth \~ $10M

Sidenote, Jason Robbins CEO of Draftkings is on the board.  A partnership involving [Sports.com](https://Sports.com) was always speculated.

With \~47M shares, as of Friday's close at $.295, LTRY was trading with a market cap below $15M.  We have identified up to \~ $50M in potential value here, even considering the small debt they carry.  That implies it could have upside of \~200% from this mark.

Besides this, I think at this level it should be worth considering that Lottery has a significant competitor, JackPocket.  [https://jackpocket.com/](https://jackpocket.com/)

Honestly, JackPocket seems to have their shit together.  They operate in more states, have real investors, and a partnership with Circle K.  What JackPocket doesn't have is [Lottery.com](https://Lottery.com) and a public listing.  I can imagine a scenario where JackPockot would buyout Lottery, gain access to additional states, [Lottery.com](https://Lottery.com), international gaming partnerships, sell off [sports.com](https://sports.com) or use it for another use and maybe...just maybe...effect a merger to become publicly listed.

TLDR:

\- Lottery has done very poorly and is down 98% from highs.

\- They have had some really terrible news.

\- They do have a real business and interesting assets/domains that have value.

\- Off chance of a buyout/merger.

\-  At 30 cents there is probably more upside than downside if considering the total value.

FWIW I have personally used [Lottery.com](https://Lottery.com) to buy tickets and it worked great.  Most convenient way to play the the Lottery.

&amp;#x200B;

Disclosure:  Bought a small position Friday at 30 cents.  Cheaper than a lotto ticket and more fun.

First of all their Market cap is at 27,3 mln but their EV (Mc+debt-cash) is 27,3+11,8-91=-51mln

Lets say some1 is going to buy all of their sahres for 27,3mln in reality he will get a company with 273mln worth in assets(91mln in cash and 40mln in short term investments) and 89mln in liabilities. So if he liquidate all of their assets and he pay all of their liabilities he will have a net profit of 180mln so he could \*6 his initial investments.

From their annual sec fillings we can see a huge increase in their revenue and in their net income

also for 2021 their net income was more than their total MC.

Unfortunately there are only a few publicly traded MP names like $SIGA $GOVX $INO (marginal) $TNXP (marginal). Last week a new player entered the game as a monkeypox test IPO - $VRAX. Talk about timing. IPO on 7/21 with 1.35mm shares offered at $5 this rallied nicely with the group until about noon on Friday, at which point to put it mildly, the wheels came off. From a high of $29 this thing fell 75% in a straight line, halting 13 times in the process, and at one point was down another 20% a/h trading as low as $4.20 (hence qualifies for pennystocks). Why you might ask? Well, bears will point to an Edgar filing that asked for an extension to file their annual report (was due Sun 7/31, co. only public for 10 days prior). I call bullshit and here lies the opportunity.

Some prominent chatrooms started getting short as the name fell (not naming names but not hard to figure it out). Now this is an brand spanking new IPO, with 1,350,000 shares in the current float, with a borrow rate of $5880 per 1000 shares. At the close the final tally on volume = over 11+mm shares. My thesis is that as of the close friday there are still many many many many many many shares sold short in this name, like 4-5x the float short. Massively massively short a monkeypox testmaker, in a hot sector, with nonstop negative monkeypox news. I like these odds. Alot.

tl;dr = Taking a long on $VRAX for a move to $15+ next week."|0.87|144|0|144

The Company is pleased to report the following results for the year ending March 31, 2022:

Highlights:
Over the first fiscal year of being a licensed producer, Greenway reported an -298,497 Adjusted EBITDA on $1,984,317 of revenue
Greenway harvested its first crop in April 2021, and commenced sales in July 2021, providing the Company with three quarters to produce revenue.
Observed the THC content, quality and quantity, improve with every subsequent crop.
Achieved an industry leading cost per gram to produce
In September, 2021, Greenway listed its common shares on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the GWAY stock symbol.
Greenway completed a non-brokered private placement that was fully subscribed, raising aggregate gross proceeds of $8,000,000.
In February, 2022, the Company announced an expansion that will provide Greenway with 167,000 ft2, which will increase capacity to produce cannabis by 300%
""Our team is proud of what we have been able to accomplish so far,"" said Carl Mastronardi, President of Greenway Greenhouse. ""We have grown extremely high- quality cannabis, which we have seen reflected in both our testing results and the way the public has been reviewing our products. We are proud of the partnerships we have that are currently in the market, and look forward to expanding the partnerships and the public's access to our cannabis over the next year.""

""Greenways management has been thankful for the support it has received from the public and shareholders over the course of our first year. From our quality, to our lean overheads and our fiscal transparency Greenway is continuing to strive to be the best in the industry. said Jamie D'Alimonte, CEO of Greenway Greenhouse. ""We are continuously making every effort to become more efficient and profitable, and we believe this upcoming year will see us take another large step towards showing our true potential.""

""For our first fiscal year of revenue, of which only the last 9 months had revenue, I am quite pleased that we have a negative Adjusted EBITDA of $298,497 for the full twelve months. In this competitive industry, it is not feasible to have a long list of customers in its first year of sales. However, by the end of the fourth quarter, the reputation of the high quality of our cannabis had certainly contributed to the acquisition of new customers. Management is very positive about the future of this company."" said Darren Peddle, CFO of Greenway Greenhouse.

"" 

On July, 28, 2022, the Board of Directors of Lottery.com Inc. (the “Company”) determined that the Company does not currently have sufficient financial resources to fund its operations or pay certain existing obligations, including its payroll and related obligations. Accordingly, the Company intends to furlough certain employees effective July 29, 2022. As of July 29, 2022, the Company owed approximately $425,000 in outstanding payroll obligations. The Company’s inability to pay this amount may result in employees terminating their relationship with the Company and/or pursuing legal remedies. Since the Company’s business is dependent on the efforts and talents of its employees, particularly its developers and engineers, and the provision of ongoing services to customers by its employees, a material loss of its employee base may result in the inability of the Company to operate its technology, meet its obligations to customers, the loss of key customer relationships and revenue, and claims for breach of contractual obligations.

Additionally, the Company’s capital resources are not sufficient to fund its operations for a twelve-month period and, therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is not able to secure additional capital resources or otherwise fund its operations, the Company will be forced to wind down some or all of its operations and pursue options for liquidating the Company’s assets, including equipment and intellectual property.

t3_wb2t4q|1659095594|pennystocks|Solo Brands $DTC has great potential to run up into earnings and beyond. After $AMZN beat earnings expectations and rallied 13% afterwards, we have a great indicator for other Consumer Discretionary stocks and overall consumer spending.|"# Hi there,

the last couple of months I focussed heavily on two diffrent stocks, which both have the potential for great gains around earnings. Solo Brands $DTC is a consumer discretionary stock, which sells Leisure/outdoor products mostly online. The company IPO\`d last October at a really bad point in time and subsequently dropped from 23.42$, a little overvalued, down to 3.66$, extremly undervalued. 

The recent earnings report of $AMZN clearly showed, that the economic outlook is far better then expected. (Allthough still not super great, tbh) 

https://preview.redd.it/5n52275iqhe91.png?width=1057&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f55ca3429dcfaf7cadd05630160f4bb9053f85d0

After a 6 months downward trend line, $DTC formed a nice Wykoff Accumulation pattern and made a nice break out yesterday day, above the 4.74$ resistance. This is a strong technical sign and further share price pull backs should be met with increased demand, the 4.74$ resistance which held for 2 months will now act as a great point of resistance. A breakout above 5.50$ would trigger a big run up of $DTC, because its heavily shorted.

$DTC was sold short for months, because it went from profitable to unprofitable, but at a closer look, this happened due to 3 acquisitions $DTC made, which lead to over $100M implied costs recently. With those big One Time costs out of the way, $DTC has a much greater outlook, then back in oct. when it was at 21$, analysts expect $550M in revenue and $70M in earnings. With a current Market Cap. of $450M $DTC is pretty undervalued compared to the Leisure/Outdoor industry.

Based on the Price-to-Earnings Price-to-Sales and Price-to-Earnings-Growths $DTC\`s fair value lies at 2x-3x of the current share price of 4.88$, with the great technical outlook a decent earning on Aug. 11th could trigger a great run up of $DTC. There are 3.14M shares sold short atm and the float dropped substantially due to institutional holdings. This means, that only few shares are traded on the free market and any attempt to cover those short positions will lead to an exorbitant increase in share price.

According to Ortex around 300k shares were bought back by short sellers yesterday and the stock price rose by 12.41%, allthough those numbers are surely not 100% accurate it shows the potential, which lies in $DTC. Short sellers need to close their positions in order to make money and the longer they wait the further their profits melt, so they are in a time crunch, right before a great earnings run up can be expected. This leads to an explosive combination, which can be exploited by retail sellers.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ywqe2slvvhe91.png?width=1130&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1743474b08f6f4deeaa0b4a555ac85f9959819aa

If we take a look at the graph, we can see, that while the share price was mostly stable and/or went slightly upwards, the short interest steadily increased, this is the best possible development. It shows, short sellers tried to suffocate the share price, but failed, even better all those shorted shares have to be bought back, too at some point.  

$DTC has very low avr. daily Volume around 600k, because of that it has a high number of ""Days-to-Cover"". Essentially this means, that its not possible to close out a significant number of Shorted shares, without heavily increasing the share price.

The good thing is, in contrast to most short squeeze plays, $DTC is a great company on its own, they are profitable, highly undervalued, innovative and dont need to dilute the share pool, which is a big risk factor in most squeeze plays.

The truth in my opinion is, that short seller simply miscalculated $DTC\`s business model and scalability. I have to admit, selling camping stoves, Bondfires, shorts and kayaks at first doesnt sound overwhelming, but according to market polls there is a great following of dedicated costumers, who stick to Solo Brands and their innovations and $DTC beat their last two quarterly earnings. 

Another great indicator is the amount of insider buying, during Q2 at the end of May the CFO and CEO bought over 130k shares of their company, which suggests they were satisfied with the numbers they saw.

For anyone interested in this play, there should be another dip before earnings at Aug. 11th, but if we see the share price breaching 5.50$ there is almost no resistance until 7.50$.

I got 5$ Sept. Calls and Shares, let me know in the comments what you think!

t3_was20i|1659059922|pennystocks|The Case for Investing in Aduro’s Plastic Recycling Technology|"Through organizations like [The Global Commitment](https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/global-commitment/overview) and the [Plastics Pact Network](https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/the-plastics-pact-network), both spearheaded by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, there is an emerging global effort to greatly reduce the amount of plastic pollution by the year 2025. The Foundation reports that consumer brands accounting for 20% of global plastic production have signed on to the project, and the list is steadily growing. The goal is to create a circular economy for plastics that keeps them out of landfills, waterways, and ditches.

A major obstacle to achieving this goal is that of supply. There are plenty of plastics available for recycling, but current technology and market conditions make it nearly impossible to recycle as much as 80% of the world’s output. [Aduro Clean Technologies](https://adurocleantech.com/) (CSE: ACT) (OTCQB: ACTHF) (FSE: 9D50) has spent the last several years developing and perfecting its patented Hydrochemolytic™ platform technology (HCT), capable of upcycling waste plastics of various types (including that problematic 80%) into high-value end products like diesel, solvents, specialty chemicals, and new plastics. The system utilizes a water-based chemical process that is scalable, produces low emissions, minimizes by-products, and is very efficient compared to other chemical conversion methods. Aduro’s Hydrochemolytic™ technology also produces higher yields than most other technologies known to date (85%+ vs. 50-60%), which in turn makes plastic upcycling much more profitable.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz\_Q-GzGZP4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz_Q-GzGZP4)

**The Problem and Aduro’s Solution**

We recently found an[ in-depth video](https://youtu.be/wz_Q-GzGZP4), produced by Mariusz Skonieczny and the first in an extensive series, that lays out the investment thesis. This initial installment is 50 minutes long, so we thought it would be helpful to direct interested investors to key points in the video. First, Mr. Skonieczny discusses the 2025 date and the opportunity it represents. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz\_Q-GzGZP4&amp;t=548s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz_Q-GzGZP4&amp;t=548s)

Mr. Skonieczny continues, covering the HCT technology’s ability to recycle plastics that current technology cannot and the massive market potential that results.: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz\_Q-GzGZP4&amp;t=760s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz_Q-GzGZP4&amp;t=760s)

Here, he mentions some of the advantages of the Hydrochemolytic™ platform, including lower energy costs, scalability from very small to very large, and increased profitability. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz\_Q-GzGZP4&amp;t=929s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz_Q-GzGZP4&amp;t=929s)

Next, he takes a look at Aduro’s financial projections, focusing on the company’s licensing strategy. The licensed technology provides for high margin recurring revenues with very little capital investment on Aduro’s part. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz\_Q-GzGZP4&amp;t=1304s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz_Q-GzGZP4&amp;t=1304s)

Mr. Skonieczny continues with a segment on the larger upside for Aduro beyond its own relatively conservative projections. The model shown here was based exclusively on acquiring many small clients that would constitute the revenue base. Since introducing HCT to the market, however, the company has been in discussions with a number of very large potential clients, any one of which could become a customer and make these projections irrelevant. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz\_Q-GzGZP4&amp;t=1477s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz_Q-GzGZP4&amp;t=1477s)

He then compares Aduro’s valuation to several other companies operating in the plastics recycling industry. He starts with Cielo Waste Solutions, a market darling one year ago with a valuation north of $1 billion which has since failed to deliver a workable solution and now sits on par with Aduro. He also includes discussion of several other public companies in the space that are either pre-revenue or have insignificant revenues currently. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz\_Q-GzGZP4&amp;t=1770s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz_Q-GzGZP4&amp;t=1770s)

In this segment, he highlights how the HCT technology has been proven to work, with the pilot projects under construction serving to show the efficiency in the field rather than to test whether it works at all. Dr. Anil Jhawar, Aduro’s VP of Technology and Process Development, fills in the details with a discussion of what the company has already accomplished with processing asphaltenes and how that relates to the plastics application. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz\_Q-GzGZP4&amp;t=2405s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz_Q-GzGZP4&amp;t=2405s)

**The Upshot**

Mr. Skonieczny is lining up almost 10 hours of video on Aduro Clean Technologies (CSE: ACT) (OTCQB: ACTHF) (FSE: 9D50) and will be discussing further applications for the HCT platform, a deep dive into the chemical science behind the patented platform, and interviews with company executives. There is plenty more information coming from this source.

Meanwhile, Aduro is embarking on its pilot projects in anticipation of commercializing the technology. Look for updates on the progress of those projects, more information on technical improvements and results, and perhaps some news of potential partners or clients. There is a lot of interest and investment being generated globally in search of responsible, efficient, and profitable plastics solutions, and Aduro Clean Technologies looks to be on the cutting edge of the movement."|0.84|4|0|4

&amp;#x200B;

They stated recently that their top priority is obtaining the local USA Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs). These licenses allow a company to operate compliantly as a regulated Money Services Business (MSB).

&amp;#x200B;

**Now why would they want to do this?**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\- Solidify Banxa's position and establish a physical footprint in the world's largest cryptocurrency market  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The ability to offer a broader range of services (e.g. coins and chains) to the company's US customer base that is currently not possible through intermediaries  
&gt;  
&gt;\- No longer being required to leverage regulated intermediaries which reduces costs and also mitigates risk of reliance upon third-parties  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The ability to have local credit card acquiring for higher conversions and increased revenue  
&gt;  
&gt;\- By holding the Nevada Retail Trust License (scheduled for 2023 submission), they will also be able to offer cryptocurrency custody solutions

**What has happened to date?**

&amp;#x200B;

So, to date, *8 MTLs have formally been lodged between 22nd and 26th July*. Banxa plans on lodging the rest of the *34 applications in August*. They expect the licenses to be received in tranches from as early as *October 2022 through July 2023*.

VANCOUVER, British  Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- **NervGen Pharma Corp.(NGENF), ,** is pleased to  announce the University of Cincinnati and Case Western Reserve  University (CWRU) have published a pioneering preclinical study in the  peer-reviewed scientific journal Cell Reports demonstrating that NervGen’s  proprietary drug, NVG-291-R, promotes nervous system repair and significant  functional recovery in a mouse model of severe ischemic stroke, even when  treatment was initiated up to 7 days after onset. Currently there are no  United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs that  repair damage from a stroke. NervGen holds the exclusive worldwide rights to  NVG-291, which is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy human  subjects and is preparing to initiate Phase 1b/2 clinical trials for the repair  of nervous system damage from spinal cord injury, Alzheimer’s disease and  multiple sclerosis.  This press release features multimedia. View the full  release here: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220727006174/en/](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220727006174/en/)

“We are very excited about the data showing significant improvement in motor  function, sensory function, spatial learning, and memory, even when treatment  was initiated as late as 7 days after stroke onset,” stated the senior author of  the paper, Dr. Agnes (Yu) Luo, Associate Professor,  Department of Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry at the  University of Cincinnati.  “If these results translate to the clinic, NVG-291 would be a substantial  breakthrough in the treatment of stroke patients for multiple reasons because  the only current FDA-approved drug for treatment of stroke does not  repair damage and must be administered within 4.5 hours of stroke onset.” Dr.  Luo continued, “Most therapies being researched today primarily focus on  reducing the early damage from stroke. However, we have shown that treatment  with NVG-291-R not only results in neuroprotection to reduce neuronal death but  also robust neuroreparative effects.

Also, importantly, most therapies being  researched need to be applied within 24 to 48 hours of a stroke’s onset; in  contrast, our preclinical data shows that treatment with NVG-291-R is effective  even if applied as late as 7 days after the stroke’s onset.”  “This is another remarkable demonstration of NVG-291’s potential to repair  damage to the nervous system,” stated Dr. Jerry Silver,  Professor of Neurosciences at CWRU’s School of Medicine, co-author of the Cell  Reports paper, and inventor of NervGen’s technology. “In these studies, we  demonstrated that NVG-291-R repaired damage using at least two modes of repair:  first by substantially increasing plasticity resulting in the creation of new  neuronal connections, and second by enhanced migration of newly born neurons  derived from neuronal stem cells to the site of damage. NVG-291-R’s ability to  enhance plasticity was demonstrated by using staining techniques that clearly  showed an increase in axonal sprouting to the damaged part of the brain.

This  enhanced plasticity is an excellent validation of the same powerful mechanisms  that we and other researchers were able to demonstrate using NVG-291-R in spinal  cord injury.”  “The fact that NVG-291-R showed an effect in an animal model seven days after  the onset of stroke is very encouraging,” stated Dr. S. Claiborne  Johnston, a leading specialist in stroke care and research, formerly  the inaugural Dean at Dell Medical School and now a professor in the  Department of Neurology at Dell Medical School at The  University of Texas at Austin. “An agent that works this late and  through this mechanism could be much easier to test in trials and could  ultimately help many more stroke patients than current therapies.”  “Most therapies in development for stroke focus on minimizing the extent of  initial damage from a stroke, which means that to be effective they must be  administered within the first hours after symptom onset,” continued Dr.  Johnston. “Most patients don’t arrive soon enough to benefit from the few drugs  we have, whether in current practice or those we are testing in clinical trials.  A long treatment window will make recruitment easier and faster for future  clinical trials.”  “This is a very important development for NervGen as, for the first time in a  peer-reviewed publication, NVG-291-R demonstrated improvements in memory and  spatial learning which may be relevant for other indications affecting  cognition, such as Alzheimer’s disease, where it might improve cognition rather  than simply slowing cognitive decline,” stated Paul Brennan,

NervGen’s President &amp; CEO. Mr. Brennan continued, “While we remain committed  to developing NVG-291 in our core indications of spinal cord injury, Alzheimer’s  and multiple sclerosis, this paper provides a very strong argument to undertake  a stroke study with NVG-291. Given this compelling new preclinical data, we  believe there is a solid opportunity to secure non-dilutive funding to advance  the program through a partnership, either with industry or government.”  The full article on the study of NVG-291-R in ischemic stroke is available  online in Cell Reports in the article entitled “*Inhibition of CSPG receptor  PTPσ promotes migration of newly born neuroblasts, axonal sprouting and recovery  from stroke*”.

This is amazing news.  NVG-291 has shown superb benefits already for MS and spinal cord injury repair in animal studies.  Human studies start in Q4 2022.  This drug has more potential than any drug have heard of in decades.  And the stock is still dirt cheap. The 20% gain so far today is nothing."|0.78|5|0|5

t3_wa9b28|1659013129|pennystocks|In Case You Start Hearing 'Stagflation', Here's A Primer|"We have the stag, we probably have the flation too. Technical recession, sure. But employment data doesn't factor in (and ADP is about to change how they do their analysis by the way). In any case, I think we have a classic stagflationary case for the economy. It's not terrible, it's not great, it just is.

For those looking at economic definitions and trying to make sense of everything, I found a good article that discusses the [definition of stagflation](https://pennystocks.com/featured/2022/04/12/answered-what-is-stagflation-why-does-matter-penny-stocks/) and I've included a few excerpts from it here for a quick view of the details:

## What Is Stagflation?

Stagflation is an economic term to describe a situation where economic growth is slower, inflation is higher, and unemployment is relatively high. In simpler terms, stagflation is a situation where inflation is high and GDP (gross domestic product) is declining.

The latter of the two definitions of stagflation may be more relevant as it relates to the first half of 2022. High prices, lower growth, and a stagnant economy was something experienced decades ago during the 1970s. Companies reduced hiring initiatives as rising energy costs directly impacted operating &amp; production costs.

When unemployment is high, consumers generally have less income and spend less. But during stagflation, unemployment might not be a factor as is the case in 2022. The March read out for nonfarm payrolls came in at 431,000 with unemployment dropping to 3.6% according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Among these figures, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27+weeks) dropped to 1.4 million and accounted for 23.9% of all unemployed people in March 2022.

For all my infographic people out there...here's what the make-up for stagflation looks like:

[What Is Stagflation](https://preview.redd.it/29mblcwn3be91.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e37129ec36855c35beaf6c0e49e0ae6b30dca95e)

## How Does It Compare To Inflation?

You might want to know what inflation is in order to better understand stagflation. Inflation is a measure of how much more expensive goods and services have become over a period of time. According to the International Monetary Fund, “To measure the average consumer’s cost of living, government agencies conduct household surveys to identify a basket of commonly purchased items and track over time the cost of purchasing this basket.” These housing expenses also include rent and mortgages.

## Why Does Stagflation Matter?

Whether we’re talking about [penny stocks](https://pennystocks.com/) or stocks over $100, inflation and stagflation matter in the longer-term. Sure, you’ve got individual companies that go against the broader trend. But when there are sweeping economic trends, if the trend is your friend, you’ll want to know the factors in play. Stagflation can be attributed to several things that result in rising costs and, in turn, lower rates of production.

Oil prices are one of the core points of interest when economists view stagflation. As we’ve seen as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, international sanctions on Russian oil have put a strain on the oil market. Looking back at the 70’s, OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) put embargos on Western countries causing a rise in global energy prices. This created a snowball effect that hurt transportation thanks to rising fuel costs, which made consumer goods cost more to stock shelves. Ultimately, this lead to layoffs, which further contributed to the economic theory itself.

### Example of Stagflation: The Nixon Shock

The best example of stagflation came during the Nixon era, which saw the U.S. remove itself from the gold standard. It also saw a 90-day freeze on waves and prices along with a 10% tariff on imports. Attempting to combat stagflation, the Federal Reserve raised the Fed Funds Rate to fight inflation but then lowered it to combat a recession. This start-stop policy strategy didn’t help the overall economy and ultimately increased inflation altogether. In addition, OPEC’s oil embargo on the US triggered price spikes in energy. Businesses passed this cost along to consumers, while also curbing production. A recession then ensued in the early 1980s to eventually reduce the spiralling inflation.

As you’ll see on the S&amp;P Index chart below, the period between the end of 1971 through 1982 saw declining market prices. Since the S&amp;P 500 ETF ([NYSE: SPY](https://pennystocks.com/ticker/?symbol=SPY)), Nasdaq ETF ([NASDAQ: QQQ](https://pennystocks.com/ticker/?symbol=QQQ)) and Dow ETF ([NYSE: DIA](https://pennystocks.com/ticker/?symbol=DIA)) weren’t “born” yet, we’ll go directly off of the SPX:

A strong product line and acceptance by major cell networks are driving the company forward.

Good day everyone,

**Siyata Mobile Inc. (NASDAQ: SYTA)** is a B2B global vendor of next generation Push-To-Talk over Cellular (PoC) devices and cellular booster systems.

Current price $.84/share (as of 10:30 a.m. EDT 7-26-22)

SYTA shares closed the Tuesday session at $.835/share, virtually the same price as the Monday session with 263K shares traded. In early trading Wednesday SYTA shares are looking for traction.

The company’s future has never looked stronger, and they are reporting potential catalysts on a regular basis right now. The big news in 2022 has been the channel/distribution partners **the company has reached agreements to carry the hot SD7 product on their networks with:**

**AT&amp;T, FirstNet, Verizon, Logic Wireless, US Cellular, and Azetti, TASSTA (T-Mobile and others will likely come on board).**

In [news just released this week](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/siyatas-mission-critical-push-talk-120000291.html), the SD7 device is now available from TASSTA, a global MCPTT software provider and end-to-end solution for critical communications. TASSTA has been recognized as a ""Top 10 Emergency Management Solutions Providers"" by Government CIO Outlook for three consecutive years. They cited the SD7's battery life and robustness as reasons for their choice. TASSTA, based in Germany, targets industries including, army, emergency services, transport, building and construction, healthcare, campus and shopping centers, ports, public transport, security, government, and taxi services.

The company’s Q122 earnings report, indicated a drop in revenues from Q121. We’ve talked about SYTA’s decision last year to walk away from most of its legacy products and go all-in on its new technologies like the SD7 and VK7 (described below). It was a bold move, and the company knew it could cost them revenues in the short term.

But that move is paying off as SYTA announced a $2.2M order for the SD7 and related products after Q1 this year. The company has projected sales of $10-35M in 2023 and they will no doubt be ramping up to that level in 2022. The current price of SYTA shares looks like an irresistible value should revenue projections come to fruition.

SYTA is a small company. Those big-name partner companies I mentioned above will also be selling STYA products. If a salesperson walks into an urban police department and says, “I’m from Siyata Mobile and I want to upgrade your two-way radio system,” they will likely hear “who is Siyata Mobile?” However, if a salesperson says “Hello, I’m from Verizon” they have immediate credibility.

The PTT over cellular market is dominated by big players like Motorola. Is SYTA going to knock them out of the way? That would be nice but not likely. The global push-to-talk over cellular market reached a value of $4.2 Billion in 2021. Looking forward, IMARC Group expects the market to reach $7.4 Billion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 10% during 2022-2027. **That means that every 1% of market share is going to be worth $74M in revenues.**

Statista tells us that the U.S. smartphone market is $74B and is dominated by Apple and Samsung (75%). Everyone I know uses one of those brands. OnePlus has captured just 2% of the U.S. smartphone market and that small percentage generates $1.4B in annual revenues. If SYTA only captures 2% (I believe it could be much higher) of the PTT market they could generate $150M in revenues.

The SD7 is a game changer. It works just like a two-way radio. But those old-style radios operate on a closed network with a limited range. The SD7 is a cellular device that operates on networks such as Verizon and AT&amp;T, so their range is virtually unlimited. There are millions of two-way radios around the world waiting to be replaced.

&amp;#x200B;

The Siyata SD7 is a highly functional and rugged Android based PTT only handset. The SD7 is the cornerstone of the new line-up of products for SYTA. The device is IP68 compliant, protected against dust and debris with drop protection. To me, it’s a rugged looking product and TASSTA cited long battery life as a part of its SD7 choice.

VK7 – an in-car mounted solution that pairs with the SD7. Features an integrated 20-watt speaker, a simple slide-in connection sleeve for the SD7, and an external antenna connection for connecting to a windshield or roof mount antenna.

Uniden® Cellular Signal Booster kits are the most technologically advanced signal solutions available today offering clear phone calls and fast data speeds. They work with all cellular service providers 3G and 4G/LTE networks and are 5G ready.

I’m providing a link to a video interview with SYTA CEO Marc Seelenfreund recorded July 15th and titled [Siyata Mobile: Disrupting the Land Mobile Radio Industry with Next Generation Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P-QcMXUj7k). It’s a useful source of information about the company.

**Once again, SYTA statistics:**FYE is 12-31 (Figures below as of the most recent quarter 3-31-22)

As I said above, SYTA is at its lowest market cap of the year ($12.6M) and the company’s future has never looked stronger. When I look at the chart below, with an RSI (14) of only 30.74, I see the potential for a double-, or triple-digit bounce screaming at me.

This has squeeze potential to top it off.

t3_w9i6zo|1658936894|pennystocks|How do you guys feel about $KULR?|"I roped together 5 of the most ""interesting/important"" things about KULR that I could find.... I would love it if you guys could skim through this and give me your thoughts!

&amp;#x200B;

1. KULR announced securing a battery safety contract with NASA to test its lithium-ion cells for future battery packs designed for the Artemis Program, a series of US-led international human spaceflight programs. In that deal, KULR will be processing up to 10,000 lithium-ion cells per week and preparing for tests performed by NASA, the Department of Defense, and others completing crewed flighted missions.  

2. KULR added an additional and potentially substantial revenue-generating shot on goal to its mix after releasing a passive propagation resistant (""PPR"") solution in its KULR-Tech Safe Case product family for maritime lithium-ion battery safety. This can be a big deal, noting that it's the only known PPR solution meeting the upcoming United States Coast Guard's new safety requirements for the passenger vessel industry.  

3. KULR has signed multi-million dollar contracts and is advancing development deals with industry behemoths, including NASA, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT, $LMT), Johnson Controls, Leidos (NYSE: LDOS), and the Andretti United E Team racing group. Few, if any, other micro-cap names can come close to boasting a similar list  

4. KULR's recent acquisition of Centropy AB's innovative technologies also adds considerable value, both intrinsically and inherently. The thermal management technologies acquired through this deal can be seamlessly integrated into their existing portfolio of technologies and services for meeting demand in industries like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cryptocurrency mining – each presenting significant new market opportunities.  

5. KULR has partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) to assist in their lithium-ion battery lifecycle initiative alongside Clarios. This initiative seeks to improve lithium-ion battery production, recycling, and disposal practices. With involvement in initiatives like this coming straight from the DoE, KULR is cementing itself as the go-to company for industry-specific battery safety and disposal services. And with billions of lithium-ion batteries being used, that position is enviable.

I'm thinking about cashing the profits out, and putting them into other monkeypox vaccine makers, as the media seems to be trying to get people hyped the fuck up like it's COVID.

Please tell me you all have responded to the market equivalent of the Krispy Kreme Hot donuts now sign.

Edit 2: I'm back up to 500 ish shares, with some profits still cashed out. The after hours dip to $1.70 was really nice for a buy back in, and now I'm ready to roll in today's money.

Edit 3: I had assumed the saga of govx was over. I foolishly cashed out all of my money and rolled it into tqqq. When I can day trade without getting in trouble again tomorrow, I plan to buy back in. 
Apparently it looks like this thing is gonna go somewhere. 
As of market open tomorrow I will be bagholding 500 shares again. 

Edit 4: I'm not rich by any means. I now have in my bank account more money than I've ever had at a single time.

Edit 5: just a dollar and some change, and it's no longer considered by definition a ""penny stock"".

I am into the potential gains small caps can have, but also wary about how it can potentially be more risky.

Currently I base my research on a few factors

1. Financial performance - How the company has been doing financially, particularly it's revenue growth and P/E ratio
2. Total addressable market size - How big can the company eventually become, can it grow to become a major corporation/be bought out by one
3. Optionality - Apart from how big the company can become in one particular industry, I also like to know if they can potentially go into other industries and other sources of revenue other than it's main business line
4. Hype - Although I don't particularly buy stocks mainly based on hype but I do think how much a stocks is talked about/discussed is important to understand how the public/media view the company

Do let me know what other factors do you look at when investing in small caps, and if there are any websites/tools you like to use!

t3_w88y2p|1658806219|pennystocks|On Commodity Super Cycle, this time may be different|"See that nickel and zinc are at the bottom of their 5-year inventory levels at LME [www.kitcometals.com/](http://www.kitcometals.com/)... and copper is close to that.

At same time: ""Vale is also one of the world’s biggest nickel suppliers and a sizable copper producer. In the second quarter, output of those two metals fell 16.1% and 23.9% respectively. The Brazilian miner cut its annual production guidance for copper to 270,000 to 285,000 tons as a result of a longer-than-expected maintenance at Sossego mill and additional maintenance at Salobo mill.?

So in terms of real data, there is no reason for current drop in commodities. It's all perception and guessing.

Whether oil or copper or whatever the solution to low prices is low prices, and the cure for high prices and shortages is high prices. It works over and over.

BUT due to certain policies pushed by educators and press way too many people do not know that, and they think the policies of Lenin and Chavez which leads to extreme poverty and shortages will do the opposite, so will the cycle really play out? In the Soviet Union and VZ problems are never solved.

I think this cycle has already been mucked up. So less measures to cure shortages are being done by the people that have solved previous shortages, than I have ever seen.

Oil over $100 and vilified oil companies are still hesitant to drill, that has never happened before is one example. And at same time we drain our SPR.

I hope the public wakes up to this before we all get hurt. We want producers to think they will get to keep their profits when prices are high, instead of talk of ""windfall taxes""  This Q will have huge profits for oil companies, likely the best ever.  Let's hope they feel it is safe to put it into drilling.

t3_w80r0l|1658784324|pennystocks|The importance of dollar cost averaging (DCA), how it can mean the difference between being profitable/unprofitable, and how to properly implement a DCA strategy.|"TLDR: Allocate a dollar and percentage amount to each equity you’re interested in purchasing, so that you can buy on potential dips, bring your average down, and exit more profitable. 

Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) means buying more as an equity depreciates to bring your average down. This is way more important than people realize. Why? Let’s say that you’ve identified an undervalued equity, and purchased it. Then, the market crashes and with it, your equity. The intrinsic value hasn’t changed at all, yet you’re -50% on your position with no money left to average down. OH NO! Now it’s gonna take a +100% move for you just to break even. Good thing you found this post!!

This problem can be easily fixed. How? Allocate a certain amount of capital to each equity you choose to purchase. Then, determine three percentage buys that you’ll execute on dips. 

For example: you and your friend, Anus, want to buy stock $DEEZ at $10. You both have $1000 to invest. Anus decides to go all-in at $10.  You, having read this immaculate post, decide to spend only 50% of your cash off the bat, then spend 25% more on two consequent dips, if they happen. 

After you’ve bought $DEEZ, the US government announces that an alien has inserted an anal probe into Joe Biden’s anus. This causes a stock market crash which sends $DEEZ plummeting -50% with the broader market. Your friend Anus is stuck at a $10 average, but you spend another $250 at $7 and $250 more at $5, bringing your average down to $7.4. 

The next day, $DEEZ announces a new vibrator, sending their stock +100%, back to $10. Your friend, Anus, is only at breakeven, so he cries. You, having been the smart one, are up 35%!!! Whoo hooooo!!!!!

It’s obviously way more important than this, but this is just an example of how important DCA can be. I’ve noticed that people overlook it, and miss out on a LOT of potential profits.

Company is trading below net asset value without any debt (Market cap: \~$55MM). Their all assets are pure cash (\~$85MM) and they are planning to use that cash for loans in cannabis industry. They are planning to distribute almost all profits in dividends.

**Silver Spike Investment Corp. (“SSIC”): Situation and Company Overview**

SSIC is a Business Development Company (“BDC”) which recently IPO’d on the NASDAQ in February 2022 trading with ***negative enterprise value***. SSIC is one of a handful of NASDAQ-listed investment vehicles targeting deploying structured capital into the cannabis industry looking to generate mid-teens returns. Like other debt focused BDCs, SSIC’s investment mandate is to generate yield but to do so with a bit more flexibility than a REIT which must distribute its earnings to avoid corporate-level taxation. BDC’s typically trade on P/NAV and % yield metrics and analysis, and I would expect this psychology for SSIC as well. SSIC is an externally-managed BDC which means that SSIC itself really has no team other than its Board, and it is managed by an affiliate called Silver Spike Capital, LLC (“SSC”), which is where the investment team sits and gets paid.

SSC was so eager to set up a public vehicle of this nature that SSC invested \~$63MM of cash in the \~$85MM IPO and owns \~72% of the shares outstanding and is contractually locked up until August 2022. That majority shareholder’s $63MM investment is now trading for only $41MM just two months later. Like a publicly-traded PE firm or hedge fund, SSC derives a fairly high 1.75% annual management fee on gross assets with some other reimbursements (e.g. incentive to scale and obtain leverage but drain on low AUM situations like this) as well as a 20% incentive fee on pre-incentive fee income over a 1.75% quarterly / 7% annualized hurdle, with a catchup. Not bad work if you can get it, and this sets an incentive to generate NAV growth of at least 7% or more. These fees are typically payable irrespective of the trading level of the BDC, which you can liken to an LP vehicle, where SSC is a GP. SSIC’s Board could theoretically fire SSC and try to liquidate, but it would owe high fees to SSC to do so, and I think that scenario is fairly unlikely so we can set aside this Ben Graham net-net visual.

With a handful of peers including structured lenders and investors AFCG (AFC Gamma) and REFI (Chicago Atlantic Real Estate Finance, Inc.), with a cousin peer set in the publicy-traded cannabis REITs such as IIPR, NLCP and possibly PW, SSIC listed on the NASDAQ just in time for a broader market pull down, Russia/Ukraine, and Fed tightening. Also, for those not watching the cannabis industry closely, the global cannabis sector has also been decimated. MSOS, a reasonable proxy for public US cannabis companies, is down \~70% since its most recent peak in Feb. 2021. Other cannabis vehicles like SSIC attempted to hit the window to go public, but a number failed to get there and those which had the ability to are presumably on hold given market conditions. SSIC is managed by a team led by Scott Gordon which has experience in the cannabis space (operators, 2x SPAC promoters and investors) as well as traditional capital markets.

Unlike other BDCs, based on what information is out there publicly, there are no existing loans to evaluate, criticize or praise since SSIC has just gone public. For all we know SSIC is comprised essentially 100% of cash, equivalent to \~$13.70 a share. Let me say that again—this is a NASDAQ-listed entity which is almost pure cash trading at a *negative enterprise value*, creating a great margin of safety.

**Base Case**

In this ‘throw the bathtub out’ moment, as investors struggle to gauge risk and determine whether this sell-off is tip of the iceberg or just another blip, a mini COVID panic which will subside, I believe SSIC is an asymmetric opportunity. Buying today allows you to buy into what may be a 100% cash vehicle at the bargain price of 65 cents on the dollar. With NAV around \~$13.70, SSIC trades around $9.00 at the time of this writing, just 65.6% of NAV. ***With reversion to a 1.0x P/NAV over a year, buying SSIC today would yield a 1.5x MOIC and a 53% IRR.***

**Upside Case**

With the drawdown in the broader market with even more pain in the cannabis industry, I am excited if not outright jealous about SSIC’s positioning. Unlike other BDCs or funds, SSIC has raised fresh capital at exactly the right moment. While a BDC scaling certainly helps distribute overhead costs and improve net delivered yields and NAV growth, how many of us would like to go back to events of sudden market turndowns and have fresh capital to deploy at the top of the capital stack in a vehicle which could get \~50% leverage eventually? For those unfamiliar with cannabis, there are maybe 10-20 vehicles or funds which have AUM levels in the $50MM+ range. Even the formerly cash-rich public cannabis companies (Canadian or US) are all struggling with valuations and capital markets access, so they’re not in the lending game, and BofA and Blackstone are certainly nowhere close to coming into the space

With \~$85MM in cash, I’m sure most here at VIC would scratch their head about why a micro-cap of this nature is so interesting but if you’re steeped in the cannabis space, this is an incredibly enviable position. A year ago, senior loans in the cannabis space were being done in the 6-12% IRR context, often with light covenants and vanilla cash interest payments. Today, that environment feels radically different. I would anticipate lenders such as SSIC would probably not even look at a deal less than a 10% IRR; they are probably stretching target returns today to high teens. For context, with capital raised and deployed mostly from 2019 through 2021, AFCG boasts a \~19% YTM on its 15-loan portfolio (\~12% of which is cash interest) and REFI markets a \~17% YTM on its 23-loan portfolio (\~14% cash+PIK yields). Net of expenses and any capital held back to grow NAV, let’s assume SSIC generates a \~10% yield on net assets of \~$85MM. As soon as that yield is generated (let’s assume it takes until end of Q3 to deploy which is a reasonable guide from around the IPO), you’d be generating a 15% current yield on today’s price. Ok, pretty good for senior cap stack risk. ***Held for 1 year and reverting to 1.0x P/NAV, your MOIC would improve to 1.64x and your IRR would improve to 66%.***

If you looked back over the last year, the peers didn’t always trade at NAV either. ***In fact, in better times, a P/NAV of 1.25x is quite possible. This would put you at a MOIC of 2.02x and an IRR of 105%.*** When Piper Sandler wrote their equity research initiation report, they noted peers were trading at an average of 2.2x P/NAV (though I personally find that to be far too rosy to underwrite).

I don’t think further refinement of the upside case is necessary here, but another angle for upside is back-leverage. Like other BDCs which must operate in the confines of the 1940 Act, SSIC discusses a target 0.5x leverage ratio (e.g. $0.50 of debt for every $1.00 of equity). Typically, this leverage comes in as lower cost capital, allowing the BDC to recycle that capital in higher returning opportunities, thereby improving the ROE and dividend yield. This is one such reason why you could see P/NAVs exceed 1.0x academically because the buyer universe may simply price the BDC equity to a target yield, say 8%. Given this is the cannabis industry, which operates in contravention to US federal law, I was personally skeptical about FDIC-insured institutions offering such back leverage but on May 2, 2022, AFCG proved me wrong by getting $60MM-$100MM of such leverage. Naturally, leverage is a double-edged sword but for those concerned about an $80MM portfolio being sub-scale and NAV eroding from costs to run the platform, 50% back-leverage would allow \~$120MM of assets to cover essentially the same level of overhead.

**Downside Case**

Since SSIC is already so heavily below cash NAV, it does stretch the imagination to think of a fundamental reason why it should trade this low for prolonged periods of time. Even paying the costs to fire SSC and liquidating should keep that from being a long-term outcome. Nevertheless, BDCs have traded at wider discounts as high as 60% once in the last decade (vs. the 35% discount today). If you need a ‘Downside Case’ box to fill out in your investment process, I suppose you could use that but I think it skews the Base/Upside/Downside presentation more than warranted.

More pragmatically, SSIC could go write a bunch of silly paper in terrible companies, justifying an erosion in NAV. If you are concerned about this, I think your best comfort will come in meeting the team and reviewing their track record.

**BDCs: Current Trading Context**

According to CEF Advisors, a data source for BDCs and other similar investment vehicles, as of 5/2/22, the average BDC trades at a 7.7% discount to NAV with average yields in the 8.3% area, with equity-oriented BDCs gapped out to a 37.3% discount to NAV and debt-focused BDCs at a 5.0% discount to NAV. Presumably the discount for equity BDCs is due to a belief that NAV isn’t marked properly, NAV will decline, a large liquidity discount is merited, or other reasons. I would also note that the average debt BDC has a market cap of \~$1.3Bn, significantly in excess of SSIC’s market cap of &lt;$60MM.

Nevertheless, at a 35% discount to NAV, SSIC is clearly trading in line with the equity-oriented BDCs without good reason. However, SSIC is focused on the debt opportunity in the cannabis space and as of the IPO in February, just 3 months ago, held 100% cash. I also believe, based on the yields of the two most comparable cannabis lending/investment peers to SSIC, AFCG at \~14% and REFI at \~9%, SSIC should be able to generate yields even greater than the BDC average and therefore should actually merit a minor premium to NAV. This premium is due to both the scarcity value of capital in cannabis, scarcity of NASDAQ-listed vehicles to deploy capital into cannabis (less relevant when trading at a steep discount to NAV though), and the 200-500bps of excess return which feels present in the cannabis space relative to other industries given the regulatory quirks of the sector.

**BDCs: Historical Trading Context**

For the dinosaurs amongst us, we can also look to historical P/NAV levels of the BDC market in general. Going back to 2012, there were two periods where P/NAVs declined to wider levels. In early 2016, we saw discounts of \~20% and in March 2020 when COVID broke out, the sector gapped out to \~60% discounts before returning to slight premiums by mid-2021 (likely along with most everything else). Otherwise, the sector generally trades near a P/NAV of \~1x Given the BDC composite I looked at from CEF data shows the sector at a \~8% discount, we are on the cheaper side of history but certainly not at some bombed out low. *However, most of these declines come with periods where faith in NAV or the trajectory of NAV is properly or improperly questioned*. In the case of SSIC, we are talking about cash trading at a discount, not a loan portfolio deployed during good times and being marked in bad times. In fact, quite the opposite—SSIC will be able to deploy during high capital cost periods and should be favorably re-rated during the next time Mr. Market gets happier.

**Cannabis Lending Vehicles: Current Trading Context**

AFCG and REFI are not technically BDCs, thus they do not show up in databases like the CEF Advisors data shown above. Nevertheless, AFCG and REFI are the most pertinent comps and their business models are very similar, but AFCG and REFI used a REIT structure to climb the great wall which is an organization which touches US cannabis in some manner trading on the NASDAQ/NYSE. Using AFCG’s published book value from 12/31/21 of $16.61 and excluding any earnings since 12/31/21, AFCG trades at 0.97x P/NAV. My math on REFI suggests book value of $15.07 (a little below their 10k’s stated $15.13), which suggests a P/NAV of 1.11x.  So, the two cannabis peers, which admittedly have deployed portfolios and yield track records, are still trading at 0.97x – 1.11x P/NAV, a large premium to SSIC’s P/NAV of 0.65x where NAV is just cash. I have some perspective around the value of 'book' at AFCG and REFI which I won't share here. Let me just say that I don't think cash should be worth 35% less than the face value of AFCG and REFI's loans, and arguably this cash being freshly deployed during an industry downturn will be better paper (economically, structurally, covenant-wise, etc.).

**Catalysts to Improvement in P/NAV / Why does this exist? :**

As SSIC is relatively young, its presence in various databases is still forthcoming. Stifel (Hold; $14 price target) and Piper Sandler (Overweight; $17 price target) did initiate coverage on the name so that catalyst is already out there, but there are a few places like the CEF databases as well as Yahoo!Finance or Bloomberg which don’t yet have any yield data or dividend track record to post. I suspect that will help a little and should come out gradually in the coming months or quarters. Nevertheless, I think the biggest catalysts will be SSIC deploying its capital, generating yield, building its track record, maybe issuing equity (at prices &gt; 1.0x NAV) and eventually obtaining back-leverage.

Beyond that and standard market catalysts, US federal legalization likely could swing P/NAV in a positive fashion. While there are pros &amp; cons to the long-term fundamentals (pros being SSIC accessing cheaper capital; cons being increased competition in providing capital to the industry), there is no doubt that retail and institutional investor interest waxes and wanes around rumors in DC about Schumer’s new cannabis legalization agenda or a Republican-led solution.

As I think through why this discount exists, I half-fear that SSIC wrote some god awful loan to the worst operator in the space and only the \~1,000-2,000 shares that trade a day know about it and not me. While that is possible, I think the situation here is pretty transparent. The float is very thin with 72% of SSIC owned by SSC. That leaves only \~$15MM of float up for grabs. Volumes are low, averaging around 10,000 shares a day, so you’ll have to be patient if you want in or out."|0.54|1|0|1

PHOENIX, ARIZONA – July 21, 2022 (ACCESS WIRE) – Hiru Corporation (OTC Markets: HIRU), a Georgia corporation, would like to announce 2nd quarter ended revenues of over $2,800,000 USD with a quarterly net profit of $1,359,005 USD.
The Company posted its 2nd quarter ended June 30, 2022, Disclosure Statement with OTC Markets, Inc. which included our Financial Statements and Notes thereto. The Company has had over $4,600,000 USD in top line revenue during the first two quarters of 2022 with net profits of over $2,300,000 USD. The 2nd quarter top line revenue beat our 1st quarter by over $1,000,000 USD. The Company expects to beat its predicted annual 2022 top line revenue of $10,000,000 USD at the close of this fiscal year.
Ms. Kathryn Gavin (President and CEO of the Company), states...”We have worked very hard to meet the expectations of our clients and provide proof to them that we can meet all of their water bottling needs on an ongoing basis. We have shown them that we are willing to make major capital investments, on an as needed basis, in our automated water bottling lines to fulfill all their current and requested future needs. These actions have allowed us to solidify our relationship with our long-term clients and attract other large-scale national clients that have requested our co-packing assistance. As such, we are on currently on pace to beat our predicted 2022 revenue expectations by a 50% margin that we previously announced in November of 2021. From a financial performance perspective, we have consistently beaten each quarters revenue expectation for four consecutive quarters while at the same time increasing top line revenue performance in each of these quarters. We fully expect this trend to continue as our long-term clients are steadily increasing their purchase orders and some large new clients, that we have been negotiating with over the past few months, are starting to place large purchase orders as well. We fully expect our 3rd and 4th quarter top line revenue performance to continue this trend through the end of this fiscal year and well into the future.”
The Company is now reaching its full operational potential which has proven that our decision to dramatically increase our automated water bottling line capabilities last summer was the correct course of action. The Company expects to produce in excess of $4,000,000 USD for the 3rd quarter ended June 30, 2022, and between $6,000,000 USD to $8,000,000 USD for the 4th quarter ended December 31, 2022. That will result in an annual revenue of between $14,000,000 USD to $16,000,000 USD for calendar year ended December 31, 2022.
Ms. Kathryn Gavin (President and CEO of the Company) further stated...”Our co-packing relationship with Alkaline 88 is solid and growing each quarter. We are growing of capabilities to meet their increasing product requirements. We are also continuing to provide product support for the U.S. Border Patrol which we see increasing in the coming months and years. We are also excited to be now working with WaterSourceOne and Walmart in the coming months and years. Our conservative expectations for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, to be in excess of $30,000,000 USD in top line revenue. As I have been quoted before, the future of the Company is solid and our continued growth in all areas of our business is exciting to say the least.”

Full disclosure I am holding about 75,00 shares.

You guys remember PROG right? It nearly 10xed last fall from .66 to $6.20 based on a combination of “gamma ramp” short squeeze hype, Hootmoney/Jason Polun/TrueDemon pumping, big pharma partnership rumors and the IMMINENT “in the coming days” licensing of its pre-eclampsia Preecludia test with a THREE BILLION DOLLAR MARKET!!! Some people took profits and rode off into the sunset in their new lambos and a lot of other people HODLed for their lambos while the company dropped an ATM and the biotech sector took a massive shit, culminating in a Q1 ER during which company CEO Adi Mohanty disclosed that whoops Preecludia may actually be trash and the company wouldn’t be developing it further and yea those “partnerships” might really be “collaborations” instead. The stock took a massive dump by call end, gapping down from $1.53 to $1.16. Investors disappeared, the company quietly changed its name and ticker symbol to reflect a refocus to its smart pill tech, and short sellers have capitalized on the low volume to push the price down to a low of .57 and now currently hold it in a tight range between the high-.60s and .75. Based on L2 activity, high dark pool percentage and daily short volume, it’s clear the shorts feel they’ve milked this stock dry and want to gtfo but no one is selling so they just continue to hold it down as they cover bit by bit each day. The stock has tested .76 four times in the past couple of weeks on strong PRs but has been rejected each time because of no sustained volume.

Multiple times a week I see posts on Stocktwits asking wtf happened to PROG? or “is this PROG? or just “wtf is this stock BIOR and why did it appear on my watchlist?” It looks to me like barely anyone is paying attention to it anymore allowing shorts to sit pretty until they’ve fully exited. So in this post I will tell you wtf happened to PROG, why wtf happened is mostly good and why I think it has squeeze potential again. To be clear up front, this is not going to be the MOASS or anything close to it. It is trading where it was before last year’s run but the SI is not as high. This is however a stock that has acquired a decent amount of short interest (which as I will explain below I think Ortex is underestimating) and could easily 2-3x with any real volume. It received a new $6 PT this week and has upcoming catalysts so anything is possible. I think it’s worth a second look. Feel free to ask questions or let me know why you want to launch Harry Stylii and Adi Mohanty into the sun in the comments. NFA and obviously I am long.

**PROG Squeezed for the Wrong Reasons; Its Testing Business Was a Dud**

Progenity IPOed as a revenue-producing, pre-natal testing company. Last year’s hype-fest began when top-line results of a trial of its new pre-eclampsia diagnostic test were released in July. As we learned in the past few months, that test may not be as awesome as the former carnival barker CEO Harry Stylii claimed they were. The company is trying to sell this asset, but the entire sector is shit and liquidity has dried up except from the few companies that banked off covid vaccines. None of them appear to care about a “just ok” pre-natal test. That could change when the sector rebounds but can probably be treated as dead for the time being. Stylii was also running a possible fraud factory with its other test sales. The company settled claims it was paying kickbacks and screwing around with its billing, and once it changed those practices its revenue fell off a cliff. Stylii was kicked to the curb last September, the CFO stepped in as interim CEO and Adi Mohanty took over in early November 2021. Mohanty’s job was to get rid of the trash testing business that was bleeding cash, cut costs and refocus efforts on the real jewel in Progenity’s crown—its smart pill tech. He was handed a shit sandwich by Stylii and put his foot in his mouth on a few calls. The guy sucks at PR and retail engagement but he has in fact been getting these things done. The Avero lab was sold in November and Progenity exited the testing business altogether. Costs associated with testing and pre-natal test development were slashed with most-recent reported cash burn down to $15 million a quarter. Preecludia development was halted and some related assets were transferred to a new company created by a former employee that has its own funding. Progenity retained an undisclosed stake in the assets so it can benefit from any development without having to spend money on it.

**Progenity Rebrands to Biora Therapeutics and Advances Its Smart Pill Development**

Progenity was never going to be a massive money-maker in the testing space. Its testing products were meh and the entire pre-natal testing sector has been under scrutiny since a NY Times report on it last year. The real potential in this company is the smart pill tech it was already developing and that it supplemented with its 2019 Medimetrics acquisition. THIS is the most likely reason it attracted such a massive investment from Athyrium Capital, which at 67 million shares between it and its founder (plus a lot of convertible notes) is by far the largest shareholder in the company. Athyrium has a history of investing in the biotech space and turning companies into buyout targets. Progenity spent the past five years nailing down IP protections for it and is tying up some loose ends currently.

These pills are aiming to revolutionize the way drugs are delivered to patients in order to (1) increase efficacy, (2) reduce dangerous side effects, (3) allow patients to receive medications at home that previously required intravenous delivery, and (4) improve patient compliance because if patients think taking a drug is a hassle they’ll look for something else and/or not take it properly making their health outcomes worse. They are designed to sense where in the digestive tract they are and only release their contents when they arrive at their designated delivery location.

Progenity rebranded in May as Biora Therapeutics (BIOR) to reflect this focus on oral biologics (the name Progenity came from the Latin word for “to beget” and was no longer appropriate.) Now that it has exited its testing business, the company generates no revenue. Preecludia licensing revenues would have been a good bridge to fund the smart pill development but they have not materialized, so the company has honed in on two projects that present the highest likelihood and fastest route to partnership/commercialization in order to best utilize its cash on hand, which was $67 million as of last ER.

* PGN-OB2, part of the company’s OBDS, or Oral Biologic Delivery System (Systemic)

**PGN-600** is the farthest along and is the potential answer to Pfizer’s headaches with the FDA over its ulcerative colitis treatment, Xeljianz. The drug has been linked to heart attacks, blood clots, increased cancer risk and death and the FDA now requires a boxed warning on the product. You can read more about that here:

[https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-requires-warnings-about-increased-risk-serious-heart-related-events-cancer-blood-clots-and-death](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-requires-warnings-about-increased-risk-serious-heart-related-events-cancer-blood-clots-and-death)

A potential way to cut down these side effects is to reduce the systemic exposure of patients to this drug, or in other words apply it directly where it is needed and not have it circulating throughout the entire bloodstream first to get there. For ulcerative colitis that means directly to the ulcer in the colon, which is what the DDS does.

Within the past few months, Biora has completed two human preclinical trials using the device in both fasted and fed patients. The pill only had saline in it for these tests. They showed that the pills consistently release their contents where they are supposed to, don’t cause any side effects of their own, and are unaffected by food in the stomach, which is a first. The company is conducting a similar study in patients who have ulcerative colitis and has already submitted a package to the FDA to receive approval for a phase 1 trial with Xeljianz in Q4 as well as to discuss faster track 505b2 approval for the product. It expects an FDA response within the next two weeks. The Q4 trial will only be 7 days and a positive result further significantly de-risks this asset.

PGN-600 also has the potential to increase Pfizer's share of the ulcerative colitis market. As a result of genetics, currently 30% of people who take Humira (or similar drugs that use an anti-TNF mechanism of action) don’t see beneficial effects but cannot take Xeljianz because of the bad side effects. Biora presented data in January, February and May (done in conjunction with a world-renowned ulcerative colitis scientist) that these non-responsive patients may be responsive to Xeljianz applied directly to the inflamed colon tissue, which is what is achieved with the DDS. That's a $20b market that the DDS may unlock access to for Pfizer in addition to helping it dominate the field of ulcerative colitis drugs that use the same mechanism of action as Xeljianz. It's a bit dense but you can read more about that here:

In other words, this is a no-brainer asset for Pfizer to acquire if it works. Pfizer has already tried to broaden its UC portfolio via its recent acquisition of Arena and it’s clearly an area of focus for the company.

**PGN-OB2** is a pill that not only deploys in a targeted location but uses a propulsion mechanism that has been demonstrated to achieve subcutaneous penetration—in other words, something similar to IV but from within the body. It gets the drugs into the bloodstream without needles and potentially could be used to deliver a wide variety of large molecules to patients at home without having to inject themselves. OB2 uses Novo'’s liraglutide and the company is looking into capturing the diabetes market with this technology. The company last week presented results from two animal studies using the device with Humira showing (1) a more than 90% success rate in deploying in the correct spot\* and (2) an average bioavailability of the drug of 25% with the high being 55%. This is magnitudes higher than what can currently be achieved by pills (Novo's pill option only has a one percent rate) and much closer to the bioavailability from needle injection.

* The study reported 83% but one pill had a manufacturing defect so when that pill is discounted the result is 91%.

These OBDS pills are the ones that the company disclosed partner agreements concerning last year. According to Mohanty on the Q122 call, the partners are looking for a 10-15% bioavailability result in order to proceed. Biora nearly doubled that. The company plans to seek FDA approval for Phase 1 trials of this device early next year. It already has one trial planned with Ionis Pharmaceuticals. The other two partners/collaborators remain unnamed but positive results thus far make it likely they will (or their drugs will) become public later this year when Biora puts in its FDA trial application paperwork.

**RSS - A Dark Horse and Potential Revenue Generator**

Although Preecludia is on ice, Biora in May presented data from a study it did in conjunction with scientists from Takeda Pharmaceuticals to test its RSS or Recovery Sampling System, a product that may replace colonoscopies with smart pills that capture images and transmit them electronically to an app. The company hasn’t discussed this program much but Takeda is clearly already interested and I wouldn’t be shocked to see an investment by it or another company in this technology. You can read more about the platform here:

[https://investors.bioratherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/biora-therapeutics-shares-data-presented-digestive-disease-week](https://investors.bioratherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/biora-therapeutics-shares-data-presented-digestive-disease-week)

**The Squeeze Thesis**

The recent positive data releases concerning both its clinical programs resulted in HC Wainwright increasing its PT by 50% to $6, but it barely moved the stock price. It quickly tested and was rejected at the .75-.76 level each time. This makes no sense to me, especially given that BIOR's chart had just thrown up an inverse H&amp;S and has been trading in such a tight range. Even the shittiest of stocks generally get a nice bounce on PR like this. In my view it’s 100% attributable to low volume, which has averaged 1.64m recently and hasn’t reached 1m on some days.

The stock has been at 100% utliization for 15 weeks. Ortex data below show that as of the end of June the number of shares short was 18 million constituting 12.92% of the free float. This number almost certainly has to be wrong. That would imply a free float of 139 million shares. Yet the total float is 184.2 million and as mentioned earlier Athyrium alone holds 67 million shares. Adjusting the float to account for Athyrium’s shares, current SI is closer to 20%. Ortex has had a short squeeze signal for BIOR for the past two weeks and its current Fintel score is 95.5%. Cost to borrow is in the 23% range and days to cover is 8.62.

📷

Over the past 20 days, dark pool activity averaged 66%. It hit or exceeded 80% on four days recently, including the day the OBDS PR was released. Short volume has consistently exceeded 50% of daily volume.

If you observe the L2 during the trading day, the same exchanges consistently appear on both sides of the bid and ask generally starting with a high spread and walking the ask down to a large bid where the stock will be held until the bid is filled. Occasionally very large asks appear out of nowhere and after hours sell walls are a daily occurrence. The stock pretty much does not move after hours. This coupled with daily fluctuations in borrowed shares says to me that shorts are day trading borrowed shares to hold the price down while they attempt to exit their positions, which will take forever at current volumes. Generally the daily Ortex shows a small percentage decline in the short interest each day. However on days where there has been PR (or a TrueDemon tweet), short interest has increased. This week on data results however, short interest increased almost 10%.

**Note: Athyrium IS NOT Shorting its Own Stock**

Last year it became a popular theory that Athyrium was behind the price manipulation in order to accumulate more shares. This theory is trash. First of all, Jeffrey Farrell is an insider and it is illegal for insiders to short their shares or to use options to achieve a synthetic short position. A reddit post last year focused on a clause in an offering document that permitted purchasers to short as a hedge. That applies to OTHER purchasers. You cannot contract your way out of the law. If you are a convicted felon it is illegal to carry a gun. You think if you sign a contract with a shooting range that lets you carry a gun around that the Feds can’t descend on your ass and lock you up? Hell no. It is illegal. Second, as an insider, Athyrium and Farrell have to file forms with the SEC shortly after transacting in the stock. Athyrium has filed no such forms since September. So no, Athyrium wasn’t hoovering up shares at low low prices from shorting. Athyrium is run by a well-pedigreed science geek who is trying to flip this company for big gains. Look at this guy. He probably soaks his jockey shorts just thinking about being part of a drug delivery revolution:

📷

This guy is on our side. He's on the board and has stacked it with people with histories of negotiating buyouts. He wants one here. So who is shorting? Probably the usual suspects who disclosed short positions in the stock in Q1, including Sabby, Susquehanna and Wolverine Trading.

**Upcoming Catalysts**

Upcoming known catalysts include FDA feedback (and hopefully sign-off) on the DDS phase 1 trial by the end of the month, the BTIG investor conference on August 8, results from the DDS trial in ulcerative colitis patients by the end of Q3, and the start of the phase 1 DDS trial in Q4. Biora has disclosed that it has other OBDS preclinical trials in progress. Results could drop at any time although this company has a hard on for presenting data at conferences rather than just dropping PRs so we may just see announcements that more abstracts were accepted at conferences later this year. Potential speculative catalysts include an OBDS submission to the FDA, the naming of at least one of these partners by year end, and maybe a Preecludia sale.

**Risks**

**The Shit Doesn’t Work**

This is a clinical bio. Animal results don’t necessarily transfer to humans. I think this is pretty self-explanatory.

**Cash Flow/Debt/ATM Dilution**

As I mentioned, the company generates no revenue currently. It has enough cash on hand to fund through Q1 2023. It also has an open $90m ATM. As of Q1 reporting it had only used about $10m of it but could start using it more if other funding doesn’t open up. The company carries a lot of debt, mostly via convertible notes largely held by Athyrium. If clinical results continue to progress on their current track, I expect milestone payments or other type of cash infusion from Pfizer, Ionis or one of the unidentified partners by year end but that’s just my optimistic view. I also expect Athyrium to infuse the company with more cash in exchange for convertible notes if it comes to that. Athyrium is not going to throw its entire investment in the trash just because the company can’t fund the rest of its clinical studies.

**Reverse Split**

The company fell out of NASDAQ compliance at the end of May. It has until December to regain compliance and can seek an additional 180-day extension if needed. My understanding from reports of IR conversations is that this is not under discussion at the company and it’s trading at .70, not .20. I consider this a nonstarter but including it for completeness.

**Conclusion**

PROG/BIOR has successfully pivoted its business. While it still has cash flow issues to resolve, the progress it has made thus far and continues to make on its oral therapeutics point toward pharma cash coming in sooner rather than later. Because its former CEO was a dirtbag, the new CEO has taken a slower and more methodical approach to its testing but it is consistently yielding positive results. Likelihood of success does not merit such a low valuation (currently half of its closest competitor RANI) and I believe this is artificially created by shorts trying to exit the stock on low volume. A meager increase in volume (\~10-20m) could break the .76 resistance and put this on a gap fill back to $1.53 and even over $2. I don’t have massive squeeze price predictions but in my view most similar retail stocks that ran in recent memory (ATER, MULN, BBIG) seemed to max out around $6 fwiw.

(GEGR) Announces Its Consorzio Green Solution &amp; GNL Finalizing First Tranche of Acquisition of Tigullio Shipping Spa in Continuation of Its Marine LNG Green Energy Projects|"News Link: [https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/131771](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/131771)

Salt Lake City, Utah--(Newsfile Corp. - July 25, 2022) - Gaensel Energy Group, Inc., (OTC Pink: GEGR) (""Gaensel"" or the ""Company""), a diversified holding company, is pleased to update and announce the finalization of the first tranche of the share capital of Tigullio Shipping spa, the company that owns and manages the western wing of the Chiavari Marina. ([www.marinadichiavari.it](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/mok3aue18A)).

The total final investment will be equal to € 10,000,000.00, a sum totally self-financed by the Green Solution &amp; GNL Consortium.

G. Pierfrancesco Mussumeci, President of Consorzio stated, ""At the end of the acquisition, the net assets of Tigullo Shipping spa will be approximately 15,000,000.00 with a 30-year Italian government concession. The acquisition of Tigullio Shipping spa will allow the Consortium to use the Port of Chiavari, a renowned Ligurian tourist resort very close to Portofino, both as a commercial base for its Cantieri Navali Estensi brand ([www.cantieriestensi.it](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/kzQOZi1EmD) ), and as the first Italian tourist port equipped to refuel hybrid diesel and LNG boats.""

In 2023, the Consortium will present its flagship ""Cantieri Estensi"", which is a 64 foot yacht, with a hybrid diesel and LNG engine at the Cannes International Fair. The project is already active and developed by Cantieri Estensi and Meccanica Yacht Services srl specialized in the refitting of marine engines and part of the Gaensel Energy Group of companies.

The development of LNG also guarantees a green turning point in the nautical industry without penalizing the performance and comfort of the boats.

Tigullio Shipping's five-year business plan expects to reach revenues of € 5,000,000 with an active margin of € 1,000,000 / year.

Thanks to the synergies with the Port of Chiavari and the innovative Green policy, as well as the expansion on the main European and American markets, Cantieri Navali Estensi, a brand controlled by the Consortium, anticipates it will be able to reach a turnover of 30,000,000 euros by 2025."|0.6|1|0|1
t3_w7m17y|1658747091|pennystocks|$PSTI changes to $PLUR. Why is this significant?|"Pluri Inc. (Nasdaq: PLUR) , a leading biotechnology company, today announced its name change (from Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. Nasdaq: PSTI), reflecting a broader strategy of leveraging its 3D cell expansion technology to develop innovative cell-based products that can be harnessed for a range of fields beyond medicine, providing solutions for various areas of the life sciences. As of July 26, 2022, Pluri will begin trading on Nasdaq under the new ticker symbol “PLUR,” CUSIP number 72942G 104. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are a few points that explain why this move is significant and could boost the company's value: 

1. The company will be offering more solutions for more industries, this gives Pluri more room for growth in the near future and could make them a household name in many different markets.
2. Pluri's Partnership strategy is very smart. Partner up with a company that has a lot of experience in a certain market, license them your cell manufacturing capabilities so they can produce a product and take a large share of the revenues. Due to this strategy, the Pluri stock can boom every time a new partnership is announced. 
3. This rebranding effort could really get the Pluri name out there and help the company get more partnership and joint ventures opportunities.
4. Pluri are now highly promoting sustainability: This could open the company to more environmentally conscious and green investors. 

&amp;#x200B;

It will be very interesting to follow the stock and see how much the company can grow with the direction they are going in."|0.5|0|0|0

t3_w78j8m|1658703612|pennystocks|So Who Is $RECAF (Recon Africa's) Arch Enemy, Short Fund Viceroy Research? Are They Behind Planted Fake Stories?|"The leader of the pack in the short attack on Recon Africa is Viceroy Research. They have been very public about it, putting out PRs attacking Recon ($RECAF), but I think they are doing even more behind the scenes. They may be funding fake enviro lawsuits, placing stories in news sites and maybe even corrupting science journals with misinformation. 

 

### Examples of Hit Pieces on Recon: 

A huge hit piece was put out this week by the Globe and Mail [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-rcmp-investigating-canadian-oil-company-reconafrica-after-complaints/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-rcmp-investigating-canadian-oil-company-reconafrica-after-complaints/) And that was based to a large part a science journal article by Kosters, and Kosters used Viceroy as a source in that article pretending they were an objective source and censoring the fact they are a convicted and fined Short Fund that spread lies about another African based company to profit from a panic AND that they have a big short position in RECAF stock.

As a rusty geologist I am appalled that the editors of that journal did not catch what I did in 2 minutes of research on Viceroy and Kosters' article: [https://earthsciencesociety.com/2021/08/05/canadian-company-recon\_africa-drills-for-oil-in-the-okavango-delta/](https://earthsciencesociety.com/2021/08/05/canadian-company-recon_africa-drills-for-oil-in-the-okavango-delta/) Shame on them and her.

Kosters ends her article with "" The world is in a climate crisis and must transition to non-carbon energy as fast as possible. We all know that we can’t do that overnight. Producing existing plays during this “bridge period” is legit, but developing new plays in pristine parts of the world is disingenuous and inexcusable. ""

**So she is saying her motivation is a fear of ""climate crisis and we must transition to non-carbon energy as fast as possible"". So her fear is Recon finding oil. BUT the first part of the article is all about her claiming there is no deep sedimentary basin, so that there is no possibility of oil, which means RECAF cannot cause climate problems, which is her main concern??????????????**

She says before that ""At this point in time (late November 2021) ""we are sure a deep Kavango Basin doesn’t exist."" and says because of that, there is no oil. **She cannot have it both ways. If there is no oil there, Recon will pump a bunch of cash into a very poor country, and everyone wins except Recon and its investors.**

Kosters is claiming a massive conspiracy by RECAF to fool the entire oil industry, with many famous outside experts as co-conspirators. That RECAF goes before big geologist groups and does Q&amp;A fooling them all, no one notices there is no sedimentary basin there that could have oil looking at the seismic. Very hard to believe, plus she contradicts herself saying developing a new oil play will cause huge climate dangers, yet there is no oil there, so there is no danger. She has zero cred with me.

She cites Viceroy as if it were an unbiased source. Withholding the fact it is a short hedge fund convicted of sleazy stock manipulation and has zero geology expertise. Here is how she puts it: ""Conclusion Viceroy Research (2021) blasted ReconAfrica’s enterprise for deceiving (potential) investors and from not being clear about whether they will need to use fracking. This claim is also made in the lawsuit that was filed against the company.""

## So, Who Is Viceroy Research?

**The Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) has imposed an administrative penalty of R50 million on Viceroy Research – a short-seller that sent South Africa’s markets into a spin in 2018 by targeting Capitec bank in its reports.** The group, which dubs itself an “investigative financial research firm”, is a partnership between Aiden Lau, Fraser John Perring and Gabriel Bernarde. It is known for publishing reports and investigations into companies – which they categorise as opinions and personal views, but contain damning allegations and inflammatory positions.

Viceroy gained some prominence and credibility through its reports on Steinhoff, in which the group appeared to have ‘called it’ on the multinational around the time of its infamous crash at the end of 2017. In 2018, the firm took aim at Capitec, alleging that the South African banking group was operating as a loan shark, warning that it was “heading for insolvency”. The group alleged that Captiec was making unsecured loans mainly to low and middle-income households and concealing losses by refinancing loans that customers were unable to repay. At the time, it labelled Capitec “uninvestable” and called for the Reserve Bank to step in and put the bank under curatorship.

The reports caused a crash in Capitec’s share price – tanking 23% on the day it was published – and it would take weeks of reassurances and the backing of National Treasury and the South African Reserve Bank to calm market jitters around the claims. Viceroy did not let up on its attack on Capitec, however, and published follow-up reports and responses through to July 2018, keeping the finance group’s share price under pressure. It also later took aim at other listed companies in South Africa, such as NEPI Rockcastle. More than four years later, the FSCA has now taken action against Viceroy for the chaos it caused.

[https://businesstech.co.za/news/finance/519514/capitec-short-seller-viceroy-fined-r50-million/](https://businesstech.co.za/news/finance/519514/capitec-short-seller-viceroy-fined-r50-million/)

Which also pointed out on Capitec what we are seeing today on Recon:

### Explaining the large penalty, the FSCA said it took several factors into account. Specifically:

The fact that Viceroy made a concerted effort to publish the statements about Capitec as widely as possible, knowing that Capitec is a systemically important financial institution in South Africa and that these statements had the potential to trigger a run on the bank.

Capitec suffered significant losses and damages as a result of their reports – with its share price crashing 23.12%. Meanwhile, Viceroy, being a short-seller, gained financially from the decline in the share price.

Kosters and the Globe and Mail left this crucial information out. Why? Are they both on the payroll of Viceroy? They act that way.

There remains a big question, just because Viceroy is a convicted sleazy Short Fund that spread misinformation about SA bank Capitec to crash the stock, that does not mean that Capitec was not a bad investment. Viceroy said Capitec were already bankrupt and had no chance of success 5 years ago. What has happened since?

# Was Viceroy Right About Their Prior Target Capitec? No, It Is A Super Profitable Bank 5 Years Later

I just looked up Capitec; Revenue 31.39B Net Income 8.52B, wow that is a fabulously profitable bank 5 years after Viceroy said they were already bankrupt. [https://www.msn.com/en-za/money/stockdetails/analysis/jse-cpi/fi-am3www](https://www.msn.com/en-za/money/stockdetails/analysis/jse-cpi/fi-am3www)

The stock has been going up for the last 3 years after the Viceroy phony attack on them wore off. This time with RECAF I hope it is not a fine, the Viceroy folks deserve to go to prison if this is another Capitec like deception as it appears to be.

## Addition: 

That business article mentions NEPI Rockcastle, a company have never heard of, but a target of Viceroy too. How are they doing since?

**Fitch RATING REPORT NEPI Rockcastle plc**  


Tue 07 Dec, 2021 - 8:36 AM ET

The Positive Outlook of NEPI Rockcastle plc’s Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflects the company’s long record of a conservative financial profile and Fitch Rating’s expectation that the new management will commit to maintain this. NEPI’s net debt/EBITDA has remained below our 7.0x upgrade rating sensitivity at 6.1x (end-2020) and interest coverage has remained strong at 6.0x. The Positive Outlook also reflects NEPI’s EUR5.6 billion income-producing portfolio of regionally dominant shopping centres

So, of the four companies that Viceroy has attacked three have done well since and none of the three had the problems that Viceroy claimed. So, it appears they are very inept on top of being sleazy.   It is not hard to find stocks that are overpriced. I have a list of short prospects, just looked at the Bs and Cs (there were not any As) on it and see BITO, BYND, CHWY, COIN and CRWD. 100% have crashed more than the market has in the last year.  It is reassuring to see all this evidence that Viceroy has been so wrong before and sleazy.  It helps a buyer of RECAF stock today because it has depressed the stock price just as their phony attack on Capitec did. But it has hurt existing RECAF investors.  Maybe a lawyer will want to do a class action lawsuit on Viceroy?"|0.89|42|0|42

# Cannabis industry:

The cannabis industry has grown dramatically in recent years in response to expanding legalization and a flood of capital from venture capital firms and other investors. The industry broke new ground last year as New Jersey, Montana, South Dakota, and other states and jurisdictions voted to legalize the recreational use of cannabis.1 This year, New York, Virginia, New Mexico, and Connecticut were added to the list of states legalizing recreational use.2

The legalization and sale of cannabis are advancing rapidly not only in the U.S. but globally. Global cannabis sales are expected to increase from $13.4 billion in 2020 to $33.6 billion by 2025.3 That growth opportunity has spawned a long list of startups, IPOs, and also a wave of cannabis-related mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) involving companies in production, distribution, real estate, retailing, and other areas.

Despite that growth, the global COVID-19 pandemic created a major upheaval in the cannabis industry in 2021, and the industry faces major challenges in 2022.

**It’s not a secret the cannabis industry went down a lot the last couple of months, even the main ETFs lost a significant percentages:**

13% is very low but they took a strategic decision roughly a year ago to bring it up to 25-30% and in the last quarter of 2021 they were pretty close, the first quarter is considered a tuff quarter every year for the industry.

The company goal for 2022 is to be with positive EBITDA in the third quarter going on forward.

t3_w6v4k2|1658667715|pennystocks|Who’s ready to sail? An in-depth DD on $GLBS|"Good morning folks, let me introduce you to one of the most undervalued company I have seen in a long while. I am talking about $GLBS, also known as Globus Maritime.

**Who they are and what do they do**

Globus Maritime is a drybulk shipping company operating on a worldwide basis. What does that mean? They currently own and operate 9 drybulk carriers on a worldwide basis.. These are not container ships, they store and transport raw commodities such as iron and other ores, coal, grains, sugars and cement.

&amp;#x200B;

[This is Diamond Globe, their biggest vessel, technically known as a Kamsarmax](https://preview.redd.it/ak68ibi1jid91.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c4828934bc17f41d5b7a73e9ce28b6a1cb19d1f)

&amp;#x200B;

**Where does the value sit**

There are a few different ways of approaching this to find value, but first, a preview of their financials. The company has a Price to Book Value of 0.2, specifically it has Assets for $196 million, total Liabilities for $37 million and Equity for $159 million. The company has lost money for a while, but in recent years they have expanded their fleet, fixed their balance sheet and have become profitable. 2021 was the turnaround year for them, with a Net Income of $15 million, and in **Q1 2022 alone they have generated a Net Income of $12 million with a Free Cash Flow of $8 million.**

**Note:** “For dry bulk, seasonality is mainly focused on weather-related disruptions, seasonal construction demand, stocking cycles, heating degree days, and grain harvesting. Most industry participants know that the first calendar quarter of each year is the weakest period of the year”. **This means that they generated close to FY 2021 Net Income in Q1 alone, which is supposed to be their weakest industry-wide.**

I am now taking you through my 3 approaches for valuing the company with 3 different horizons, but first I need to explain some things about the industry they work in.

1. Their top line depends on the demand for raw commodities such as the ones cited beforehand. This means that the demand for their services depends to some degree on economic activity, but mainly from the demand of the raw commodities they ship, which due to the essentiality of most materials they transport makes them highly resilient, although intrinsically seasonal.
2. The fleet of bulk carriers that they own is valued at cost minus depreciation, which may reflect either a depressed or overstated value based on the market conditions, that’s why during my analysis I have also taken into consideration the safest way of valuing their fleet: scrapping value. When a ship cannot be sold, is too old to operate or the market conditions make it a more profitable choice, ships get sent to the recycling facility to get scrapped and the company receives cash/ton of scrapped vessels based on current scrap markets rates. This is the safest and surest way to value their ships, meaning that their value cannot be less than how much it would be worth to scrap them.
3. The scrapping rates are calculated as $XXX / ldt (light displacement tonnage), which is used to define the total weight of the ship alone, without any equipment, fuel or anything else (basically the weight of the scrappable material). The company does not make this data public, but I have been able to estimate their LDT using the data about their fleet that the company actually makes public + a study on the industry and how much of a vessel’s carrying capacity is then available to scrap (in technical terms, how to go from DWT to LDT).
4. The company’s vessels are estimated to have a useful life of 25 years each.

*Valuation n.1 - A pure value approach to their current balance sheet*

I will now deep dive you into their balance sheet and the valuation process, all the data shown next will reference their balance sheet on March 31st 2022.

The company’s fleet is carried on their books for $128 million, they are sitting on $59 million in cash and have some other minor assets worth $7 million.

The company has $30 million in debt and $7million in other minor liabilities.

As for the scrapping value of their fleet, the current market rates ($550/ldt) the company’s fleet would be worth $110 million. I have used a more conservative and kind of worst-case scenario of $400/ldt in my valuation, which gives us a scrapping value for their entire fleet of $80 million.

&amp;#x200B;

[These are the possible liquidation values for the company based on their balance sheet on March 31st 2022](https://preview.redd.it/xcojlkb4jid91.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f94b7d1c09691c66657e970668beab5328b033d5)

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see from the spreadsheet above, we have the DWT (Deadweight Tonnage, i.e. the weight of raw material each vessel can carry), the average conversion rate of DWT to LDT for dry bulk carriers, and some more data I will now walk you through.

Scenario A (**Net A**) values the company using only their cash, scrap value and liabilities. This is the absolute worst case scenario liquidation value for the company, this means that I believe the company to be worth no less, in any possible way, than that $104 million. I want to stress this: the company is currently selling at below their available cash. Just subtracting their liabilities from their cash would leave the company with $22 million in cash and no debt whatsoever. Adding to all of this, the scrapping value of their fleet, that is, the value they can 100% get from their ships by recycling them is $82 million, for **a total worst case scenario liquidation value of $104 million, more than 3 times what the company is currently trading at.**

Scenario B (**Net B**) uses the fleet book value instead of their scrapping value, all the rest stays the same. If one believes the company to be able to sell their fleet for 100% of their book value (cost of the ship - depreciation) then it would be worth $152 million on their balance sheet alone.

Scenario C (**Net C**) is the one I believe to be the most reflective of their actual value from the balance sheet alone. It assumes that the oldest 6 vessels the company owns will be scrapped and the newest 3 vessels (each built in 2015, 2018 and 2015 respectively) will be sold for 80% of their book value (or at a 20% discount, however you want to call it). This valuation method would give the company a liquidation value of $130 million, which is more than 4 times what the company is currently trading at.

**Note:** Remember that these three valuation estimates are highly conservative since we kept the scrapping value at $400/ldt while they currently sit at $550.

*Valuation n.2 - A pure value approach to their 2024 balance sheet*

This one requires some explanation as to how their balance sheet is going to change from here to 2024. On May 11th the company entered into two contracts for the delivery of 3 new vessels for a total cost of $108 million (which means that, in 2024, the company will be operating a total of 12 drybulk carriers). This will be financed either through equity or the creation of new debt. The first case might be possible due to the company’s history of issuing new equity to fund their activities but thanks to their current profitability and my future estimates (on which I’ll go more in depth later) I believe they could fund these new vessels through the cash they will generate and some new debt. Based on my estimates this is what the data will look like on December 31st 2024.

&amp;#x200B;

[These are the possible liquidation values for the company based on their balance sheet on December 31st 2024](https://preview.redd.it/9fgwe666jid91.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9be8575d5c3760ff66595f4a3456491ffe56d36e)

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario A (**Net A**) uses the same calculations as before, but the scrapping value does not keep up with the increased debt used to acquire the new 3 vessels so is actually lower than today’s worst case scenario. Either way, in 2024 I estimate the company to be valued at $90 million in the absolute worst case scenario, based only on their cash, the scrap value of their fleet and their total liabilities. **Still three times what the company is currently trading at.**

Scenario B (**Net B**) uses the same calculations as before, so if one is to believe that the company can sell its entire fleet for the amount they carry on their books the company would be worth a total of $210 million in 2024 based on their balance sheet alone, **approximately 7 times what the company is currently trading at**.

Scenario C (**Net C**) is the one that I believe to be the most reflective of the company’s value in 2024 based on their balance sheet alone. There are some differences from the calculations used in the previous Scenario C, but the approach is similar. The oldest 6 vessels are assumed to get scrapped for a rate of $400/ldt (again, very very conservative), then the 3 more modern vessels mentioned before are assumed to get sold for 70% of their book value (or at a discount of 30%, as you prefer) and the newest ships built and delivered in 2024 are assumed to be sold off at a 10% discount. **This gives the company a valuation of approximately $180 million based on their balance sheet alone at 2024’s end.**

*Valuation n.3 - A consideration of their balance sheet and their future streams of revenue*

This one is the more complete valuation of the company based on their future earnings potential but it’s also the least accurate since I am trying to, although conservatively, predict their future earnings, debt, costs, ecc.

I’ve spent quite some time on this spreadsheet and I’ve kept a very conservative stance in predicting their future, for example, I’ve assumed a 30% decline in revenue in 2023 since 2021 and 2022 have been helped by a higher market rates for drybulk shipping and I’ve also accounted for a slowdown in economic activity. I’ve also assumed an interest rate hike of 4% for the entirety of 2022 (consequently weighing on their debt) and an inflation rate of 10% for the entirety of 2022 (weighing on their costs). I’ve also reduced the revenue for the 2nd half of 2022 since the first six months have been characterized by higher shipping rates which are currently falling to more normal levels. I feel that going through this spreadsheet would take too long, so I am going to leave it here for you all to see and analyze and I will respond to any comments and questions about it. **My personal valuation of the company, considering both the balance sheet and their possible future earnings potential is $260 million through 2027.**

**Link to the pdf of the spreadsheet:** [**https://docdro.id/mtrA1Dg**](https://docdro.id/mtrA1Dg)

My (SPOILER: LONG) comment from the spreadsheet about the financing of their new 3 vessels getting delivered in 2024:

*Based on these projections FY 2022 should result in a Net Income of around $45 million.*

*Three new bulk carriers are getting delivered in 2024 and they cost a total of $107.8 million, of which $21.2 million have already been paid in cash in May 2022.*

*The company will need an additional $86.6 million dollars for the period 2022-2024 to fulfill their commitment, and could probably cover it fully with the cash they are going to generate, but are more realistically going to rely either on debt, new equity or both.*

*It's hard to model the diluting effects of a possible equity offering (not knowing the future levels of the stock), so we are going to assume they will use a mix of cash and debt here (which is also a realistic possibility given their newfound profitability). Additionally, the effects of a possible offering would be borne by the shareholders and wouldn't affect their P&amp;L as new debt would.* ***Given that they are currently trading at one fifth of their book value I think that, even in the case of a new equity offer, the shareholders would end up better off notwithstanding the dilution.***

*The CIT Loan Facility was negotiated when they carried 6 vessels on their books for a total of $58.9 million.*

*They were able to negotiate a facility of $34.25 million at LIBOR + 3.75% with those assets as collateral, for a LTV of roughly 60%, which is the level at which, if the collateral falls below that, the company is prohibited from issuing dividends or doing buybacks.*

*Hence, with the current value of their fleet sitting at $130 million I reasonably believe they could negotiate a facility of $65 million (let's stay conservative with a LTV of 50%, although if we assume the same conditions it could reach $78 million) at LIBOR + 3.75%*

*Such a facility would allow them to repay the remaining $31 million from the previous facility while having around $35 million for their new 3 carriers coming in 2024.*

*This would leave a net amount to fund of roughly $50 million, which I believe they could abundantly achieve through their current cash and that they will generate during 2022, 2023 and 2024.*

*In the model we assume that the company will pay what's due in 2023 by issuing debt and then during 2024 use its cash to pay the final installment. That said, it is more likely the company will negotiate a facility and use only part of it in 2023 and use some of its cash on hand and then use the remaining fraction of the facility + the remaining cash in 2024.*

*2023 revenue 0.7 multiplicator when compared with 2022 revenue is both due to the possible slowdown in economic activity due to high inflation and/or a possible recession and in part due to the fact that 2023 has in plan a number of dry-docking for their fleet, which will diminish their revenue-generating days of operations.*

*Important note: the depreciation of dry-docking expenses for the new carriers received in 2024 won't start being recognized until at least mid 2027 cause they will be newly built, and even then in 2027 they won't be as heavy since the ships are new.*

**Why is the company’s price so depressed**

The company’s stock has been hammered down because of their past negative EPS and most importantly because of the heavy dilution that the shares have seen in the past; the company has never been shy in issuing new equity to fund themselves and heavy dilution can be first traced back to the 2010s (the company has been founded in 2006). Another reason for their lower valuation (although not thoroughly sensical) is the fact that this is kind of a family controlled company. Their chairman used to own 60% of it, he now owns shy of 1% of the company but before selling his stake during the years the company (under his control) has issued preferred shares to his son (an executive director to the company) which grant him almost full control of it (10300 preferred B shares have been issued, each having 25k votes each, which would grant him full control if not for the fact that he and his affiliated parties, even having the majority of the voting power, as per the company statute denies them voting for more than 49.99% of the controlling power).

That said, I believe it to cause some misalignment of management’s interest with that of shareholders (since they have now little direct equity in the business) but their affiliates own around 38% of the company (so they have to be satisfied), plus they are managing it well and have in my opinion recently made a series of good and financially stable choices for their long term well being.

**Possible risks and things to keep in consideration**

1. One thing I do not explain to myself is why they are so illiquid. As I’ve said, the major shareholders in the company own around 38% of it, so the remaining 62% is in the hands of the market and no single other large major institution or shareholder, so I don’t know where all the volume is for the stock.
2. The company might dilute shareholders as they have done in the past to finance their business, but I don’t believe this to be a problem for three reasons, first they are now profitable and FCF positive, second they can negotiate new credit facilities thanks to the value of their collateral (Ships) having increased thanks to new acquisitions (and will keep increasing through 2024 once the new 3 vessels are delivered), and last with the company currently selling at one fifth of their book value dilution would have a limited effect on the shareholders and the value they hold.
3. A global recession, especially in China which is one of the main areas of operations for global shipping companies could affect their top line due to lower market rates for drybulk shipping. That said, I’ve estimated that they will be profitable even at the lower bound of market rates, although slightly, which gives me confidence in their ability to withstand a global recession.
4. Their debt is floating so they are susceptible to rate hikes, but they have negotiated a new facility which halved the rate they were paying a few years back, and even if rates were to double (which I have assumed in my conservative calculations) they would go back to paying what they were a few years ago, and I’ve calculated that they can fully sustain that additional interest.

**How you can play this**

Honestly I’m not here to tell you what to do, each has to make choices based on their research and risk appetite, these are solely my opinions shared on an online forum. That said, I believe there are a few ways to play this depending on one’s vision (short or long term) and one’s appetite for risk (stock vs options).

*Short Term*

I believe that the short term value play is to go long at these depressed levels and wait for their next Q2 earnings release (and if you have a slightly longer time horizon even for their Q3 release, which due to seasonality in the business is usually the strongest). Q1 2022 has been their best quarter ever and has generated almost the same amount of resources as FY 2021. If Q2 and Q3 (as I believe) will be as good or even beat Q1 then the stock will see a massive rise (in part given the outstanding proven result and on the other hand given their absurdly low price relative to their cash, debt and book value or scrapping value, as one wants to see it). In my opinion we are looking at a 3x in the worst case scenario given all of what I’ve explained in this DD. Best case scenario for me is an 8x.

Most realistic scenario for me is a 5x in their market capitalization, accurately reflecting their value.

*Long Term*

Long term here means holding at least through 2025 which will be the year that from an operational point of view will see them operating 12 ships, 3 of which modern and 3 of which brand new and more efficient than all the others. This means that they will be operating at almost 2 times the capacity of 2021, generating consistently positive FCF and making it possible for them to distribute dividends for the first time since 2012. As they keep paying back their debt and look for profitable opportunities to expand their fleet, they will keep growing in the longer term and will invest back in the business.

**Final note:** Remember that every single estimate is extremely conservative, I’ve modeled the worst case scenario in each and every valuation attempt presented in this DD. I am personally invested in the company and have a long stock position in it because I believe that, given everything I’ve laid out before, this is the most undervalued company I have seen in a great while, and with all my estimates being skewed towards the low bounds of anything positive that could happen and higher bounds of everything bad that could happen, I am even more convinced of my thesis. 

I hope this has been an interesting read for you and I’m looking forward to comments, criticisms or questions if you have any.

**TL;DR:** The company is extremely undervalued by any possible metric, are profitable and FCF positive, are growing their productive assets and have just had their best quarter while Q1 is usually the most difficult for the industry they operate in."|0.78|19|0|19
t3_w6rf2k|1658653788|pennystocks|Does Warren Buffet Buy Penny Stocks?|"One question that has arisen surrounding the penny stock market has been if Warren Buffett buys penny stocks. If you read and understand the elaborate, widely publicized investing strategy of Warren Buffett you'll see that he doesn't specifically target the penny stock arena. He is outspoken regarding his investing rules and focuses his investing on healthy financials, but he also likes value prices on stock.

Let's start with the top five just for the sake of discussion. Currently his biggest holdings are Apple (AAPL), Bank of America (BAC), Coca Cola (KO), and Chevron (CVX). If you average the latest stock prices per share of the top five holdings you'll see an average of approximately $118.00 per share. Now this figure doesn't carry much weight in the real world, except for the sake of the penny stock query.

He typically likes insurance companies, railroads, energy, banking, and a select few tech giants. None of his most favorable interests can be considered micro-cap or growth companies. In fact, the lowest price per share holdings that I can find in his current portfolio is a pharma name trading near the $10.00 per share range.

On the surface it appears Mr. Buffett avoids penny stocks. He says any stock considered a growth stock is a gamble to say the least, and he's publicly states that he's not a gambling man. The micro-cap valuation of a company also tells the world that it's a high risk investment, once again, testing fate with a certain level of gambling. Avoiding penny stocks also has to do with liquidity. This is also  discussed more in depth at stockcense.com. But does anyone have any further info on him holding small caps or micro-caps?"|0.53|1|0|1

Actually just wanted to bring everyone's attention to Helium in general. HE1 is just my choice of the very few Helium exploration companies out there. I keep my posts simple so here goes.

Why Helium?

Global shortage. The company to find Helium is going to take majority of the market share for it. Making us all rich. 

Why Helium One?

After listening to the recent interview with the CEO David Minchin, the rig is looking great, and the company is on track with drilling this year. This is a huge catalyst in the next month, and I predict a massive run of over 100% like the share price saw last time.

Currently it's sitting at the levels it was before the run, so even technically it's looking absolutely fine ready for lift off. Progress should be enough to cause a spike higher which like I said we'll see in the next month or so. This is because speculation with a small-cap stock like Helium One can cause a large movement. With a market cap of £55m, it only takes a relatively small amount of buying to trigger a sharp move higher.

Logically, if the company was able to extract helium at the end of this year and generate revenue in 2023, the picture completely changes. In the process of achieving this, the share price should move drastically higher. Even if it traded to 20p, the P/E ratio would be 25. Currently we're ranging between 8p and 10p. 

This really is an absolute diamond that could go to astronomical levels.

(CSE: CDPR) (Frankfurt: N8HP)

Was searching around for some unique resources companies when I came across Cerro de Pasco. The company was founded in 2012 and is a resource management company located in Peru with the goal of restoring long-term sustainability to the mining activity in the Cerro de Pasco region. What makes this company unique you may ask? Unlike other companies Cerro de Pasco has a commitment to clean extraction practices and promoting a sustainable mining process.

**Recent Highlights:**

* In the last month of December the company completed the acquisition of Santander Mine from Trevali Mining Corporation.

**What's Next?**

The company announced its first results of the first Drilling program at Santander Mine and this mine plans to be one of the company’s main focus. Seems as if 2022 is the year the company will go deep in this mine and seek some results.

In the upcoming months the company is planning to look into more ways to increase revenue stream, their Santander Mine is looking like it has some true potential with the findings the company has so far. With how Strong the social license and support from local authorities combined with commitment to ESG principles is, makes me definitely want to keep my eye on Cerro De Pasco. What are your thoughts? Would love to hear some feedback.

Lately, I’ve been feeling a lot of optimism and hope based on Very’s recent announcements, and tbh I feel like previous management was the reason why the SP is down −79.16% (All Time). BUT the premium products along with the company’s mission is the reason why I stayed around. Very’s competitive advantage is its product offering and I think it will be a household name in years to come. 

Since the departure of Mitchell Scott and James Davidson, I've been happy to see that only smart and responsible decisions have been made. Such as cutting high costs associated with eComm and focusing on retail - as we have seen so far with the Loblaws, Meijer, and Giant contracts. In Very’s Loblaws PR, it said more retail contracts are to come this summer and I’m excited to see what else will come our way. The new management team seems solid and dedicated, and I’m happy to see the recent appointment of experienced executives and directors. 

Q2 fins will be interested to look at, as it will be the first earnings with the new management team. I’m curious to see how they have been managing cash burn and what the current debt situation looks like. But we still got a few weeks away until they are released.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the latest press release, they have signed **24 new business deals since May 1, 2022**. In doing this, they seem to be expanding their offering to partners that include well known game developers, publishers, and brands. They are leveraging their technology, infrastructure, and fan engagement services and doing all this internationally.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing I want to point to is the continued growth and rise of e-sports. This clearly is leading to an acceleration of the services required for the sector and given its current lack of centralized infrastructure this opens up amazing opportunities for companies like $ESE. 

&amp;#x200B;

CEO, Konrad Wasiela said, *""Our new contracts and partnerships reflect the increasing demand for our technology and services. With an increasing number of new game developers globally, and with endemic and non-endemic brands leveraging the gaming and e-sports industry, we are proud to be in a position of strength.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Going forward, it has been indicated that $ESE will be developing its Technology Business Unit (I mean it's 2022, tech is kinda important). To be specific, keep an eye out for the recently released Phase 1 of its big data software (Singularity, a proprietary DataLake/BI infrastructure).

t3_w4ltz2|1658422938|pennystocks|Stocks that fare well during a Recession|"Investors had an awful start to the year as stocks twice entered bear market territory, falling more than 20%. Stocks didn’t hang there long the first time, but the second drop has proved more durable, as Wall Street has come to accept that inflation is more persistent and that the Federal Reserve will have to be more aggressive in combating it.

The S&amp;P 500 lost 16.4 per cent in the second quarter, leaving it 20.6 per cent below its level at the end of 2021.

Where to now? While a bounce in stocks certainly seems due, investment advisers say a lasting recovery is unlikely for now. They warn that a recession is probably on the way, if it’s not here already, and that valuations remain high, even after the big decline.

Fears of a recession are sending investors to safe haven investments with a history of providing stable revenue growth and reliable earnings. One sector that investors are turning to amidst the global volatility is healthcare.

&amp;#x200B;

A healthcare stock that has investors keeping an eye on is Regencell Bioscience (RGC).

Regencell Bioscience is an early clinical stage bioscience company using traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approach to develop standardized TCM formulas to holistically treat autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, and infectious diseases which affects the immune system such as COVID-19.

Since the listing of RGC on Nasdaq on 16 July 2021, RGC’s CEO has purchased over $5 million of ordinary shares and has not sold any shares. Such percentage of shareholding also gives confidence to investors and potential investors alike as it is apparent the CEO is confident about the future of the company.

As a potential recession is looming ahead, maybe its time to be add a recession-resistant stock as a well-diversified portfolio is one of the best ways to ensure you’re prepared for whatever turns the market takes.

RGC is curretnly trading at $35.84usd with over a 300% increase for the past year.

The robust soil anomalies and excellent precious metals grades in rock grab sampling over these areas have strong similarities to the geochemical signatures at the existing, large deposits at the Lawyers Gold-Silver Project. We look forward to completing the final ground magnetics and prospecting passes at Kodah and Round Mountain to finalize high-confidence drill targets. In addition, the Company is quickly advancing on its Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA), due for imminent, near-term publication.

This is mostly due to short sellers, with an extremely high short interest, but also due to the fact that they have long gone under the radar.

KTTA is a unique special situation that combines all the hottest themes of - Psychedelics - Take-over controversy - Low float special situations Folks may know KTTA as a low float IPO from last year. Apparently they took in a good amount of cash, and have more or less been responsibly sitting on it rather than pissing it away. In fact they have made some small but solid steps towards putting together a legit business. They built a bit of a pipeline. And now have clinics in the UK and IV clinics in the US.

In sum, if you have medication resistant depression you get an online eval, and a nurse will come to your home to administer ketamine by IV. Ketamine is one of the more proven and legally adopted of the 'psychedelics' category.

 Now so far, KTTA management has been pretty responsible. And I think executing well on their core mission. I don't think they go totally renegade here. I think the most elegant and perhaps likely solution is that KTTA simply says - 'you know what, we are gonna implement buy-backs until the gap is closed.' By doing this they can deliver shareholder value and keep there seats. So it seems like a case where a lot of paths for this to work out.

I’ve noticed a lot of ppl on this board bullishly posting about stocks with no cash or very minimal bullish prospects. I figured i’d make a list of a few things to look for when conducting due diligence. 

1. Make sure the company has enough cash on hand to fund operations for AT LEAST 6 months. The way to determine this is either A. divide their burn rate (cash spent per quarter) by their cash on hand OR B. go into their most recent 10Q/K and scroll to “management’s financial analysis” and management will literally TELL YOU if they need to dilute and if so how soon. 
2. Make sure their debt is reasonable. 
3. Conduct a relative valuation analysis. Compare your company to other similar companies. Is your company undervalued comparatively? If not, why even buy it?
4. Make sure there are upcoming catalysts BEFORE the company runs out of cash. If the catalysts are due AFTER they’re forecasted to run out of cash, then it’s a worthless buy.

t3_w3tjji|1658341383|pennystocks|For you Digital Asset adjacent investors: What is transaction volume and who cares (using $BNXA example)?|"Most people on these boards seem to be pseudo-technical analysis experts, as such I am sure you all know of the effectiveness of tools such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Bollinger Bands. And for you super nerds...the Japanese Candlestick Method.

&amp;#x200B;

With Digital Assets and Digital Asset adjacent companies such methods are not always effective, especially when considering that some are modelled on derivatives. 

&amp;#x200B;

**On-chain volume:**

&amp;#x200B;

*The volume of digital currency transferred to an exchange from an external venue. As these are noted on the blockchain, instances of fake transactions are few and far between in theory.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**Trading volume:**

&amp;#x200B;

*The volume of intra-exchange trading, occurring off-chain. these are simply recorded in the order books of said exchanges and reported via APIs. These can be performed using a transfer agreement b/w two parties, guarantee of a third party, etc.*

&amp;#x200B;

For on/off ramp entities (much like **$BNXA**) who sit in the middle of these transactions/facilitate them, such metrics are a good measure of how much use the platform is getting and the growth. Now something to remember is these figures are not completely good indicators of the health of the business. Take the current market cycle for example; in the Digital Asset world, fears of continued capitulation contagion have rendered entities stagnant such that they are not buying or selling these assets anymore. Rather they are sitting on cash or in current positions. As such, the transaction volumes will seem to be dropping/stagnant when in reality it is aligned with market sentiment. In such cases, you then turn to traditional judgement of the ticker in question (take your pick of methods).

Their continued development, as well as clinical and preclinical research is definitely something I'm interested in seeing play out over the next year or two.

 Active Digital Banking Accounts   reached 509,900, up 3.7% quarter over quarter and 2.1x year over year,   despite a slightly lower SMB payments active client base compared with 4Q21.   This implies a higher activation of banking accounts in current payments   base. At the same time, average revenue per active client (ARPAC)5 has   increased 2.8x year over year and 32% quarter over quarter.

Company  expected  to launch a business credit card for SMBs in the 2H22. Despite the initial challenges company faced with the legacy credit portfolio and operation, they are committed to resuming credit offering to our best SMB clients, as this is such an important solution for them. The opportunity is huge.

The credit portfolio decreased to R$1.2 billion by December 2021 from roughly R$1.6 billion at the end of the third quarter and is recognized at a fair value of R$511 million in balance sheet.

Company  coverage ratio decreased slightly to 98% in December, which is a natural evolution of a portfolio being phased out. In January, we sold a distressed portion of the portfolio to a third party for R$12 million above its fair value.

## The Market

## Electronic Commerce in Brazil

Cashless transactions are an expanding industry in Brazil, as in other [emerging market economies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergingmarketeconomy.asp) where the majority of transactions are conducted in cash.

With a GDP of USD 3.154 trillion after adjusting for purchasing power (PPP), Brazil is the 8th largest economy in the world (source: World Bank). It accounts for one third of Latin America and the Caribbean’s GDP (PPP) and with 210 million inhabitants, it represents one third of the region’s total population. It is also the 5th largest country in the world and hosts 20% of the world’s rainforest. The country has abundant natural resource, the economy is well-diversified and enjoys a well supervised and robust financial system. Brazil is weakly integrated into the global economy and also suffers from a significant infrastructure gap, high income inequality, a complex tax system, a rigid labour market and weak governance. At a macro level, Brazil has a good capacity to honour payments in foreign currency thanks to large foreign currency (FX) reserves, diversified FX generating activities, a strong ability to attract foreign investment and a moderate external debt burden.

In Brazil, cash remains the most widely used payment method for low-value retail transactions. However, payment cards now account for a larger proportion of retail payments than cheques and are the favoured online payment method (cash is the second preferred method). The use of digital wallets, such as PayPal, PicPay and Mercado Pago, is also rising. In May 2021, WhatsApp relaunched its P2P transfer service after being blocked  by regulators in June 2020, a week after it launched.

Brazil, in recognition of the revolution taking place in payments worldwide, is in the process of updating its existing payments and financial system. In November 2020, the Banco Central do Brasil launched PIX, an instant payments scheme. The settlement infrastructure, called the Instant Payment System (SPI), is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, via mobile devices, online banking or ATMs. PIX allows payments to be made via aliases.

Electronic banking services are available from all banks. There is no national electronic banking system in Brazil, so companies use banks’ proprietary services.

Transaction and balance reporting, and transaction initiation services are available.

Many companies operating in Brazil exchange data electronically with banking and commercial counterparties via VANs (value-added networks) and EDI protocols.

The number of bank accounts with internet banking access in Brazil increased by 6% to 55.9 million in 2019. Usage of internet banking fell by 6.7%. Mobile banking has become Brazil’s preferred channel for banking operations. The number of mobile banking accounts increased by 34% to 93.6 million in 2019. The number of mobile banking transactions also increased by 19% to 39.4 billion.

A neobank is a digital bank that does not have any branches. Instead of having a physical presence at a set location, neobanking is entirely online. A broad collection of financial service providers, who primarily target tech-savvy customers, comes under the umbrella of neobanking.

What is digital payment

Featured snippet from the web

Such a payment, sometimes also called an electronic payment (e-payment), is the transfer of value from one payment account to another where both the payer and the payee use a digital device such as a mobile phone, computer, or a credit, debit, or prepaid car

Company is still making a loss in US dollars(**-59.87M**) because of adjustments in value of financial investments

**Adjusted Net Income** in 1Q22 was R$132.2 million, with a 6.4% net margin, representing a sequential increase from adjusted net income of R$33.7 million and a 1.8% margin in 4Q21. This improvement was mostly related to the successful implementation of new pricing policy and efficiency gains in costs and expenses.

**Exchange Rates (depreciation)**

July 2022 1 U.S. dollar / Brazil real =

5.39

In 2018 it was 3.88

That is 72 % loss in value.

Brazil inflation rate is 12%, core inflation is around 10%.  Brazil central bank rate is 13.25%

That is terrible conditions for lending business.

As we can see on the graph below the stock price was at the highest level when company financials were at worst.

The reasons for that are “great expectations”.  The further fall of market cap happed because of the 70 % devaluation of Brazilian currency. Company took a double hit: currency rate and depreciation of investment portfolio.

Now the market values the company upon industry metrics like P/BV as a startup.

As soon as the market goes Bullish again  it will shoot up to the the industry target around 60 $.

Here is a great interview with Blair Way (CEO of TSX.V PMET) by Trevor Hall of Mining Stock Daily. Blair is leaving the possibility open of “multiple” triple digit resource size of this burgeoning #lithium resource. Of course he puts in the disclaimer that the drills need to prove it. His choice of words indicates he thinks 100+ Mtonnes is a foregone conclusion and 200+ Mt is likely. If the resource does exceed 200 Mt, that would place the property in the top four lithium mines worldwide.

[Mining Stock Daily: Interview with Blair Way CEO Patriot Battery Metals](https://anchor.fm/mining-stock-daily/episodes/Introduction-to-Patriot-Battery-Metals-e1leclj)

**Takeaways**

1. The trend is open along strike to east and west and open to depth.
2. The core logs must look very good as Blair is no longer thinking +100 MT, but multiple 100's MT (this would be truly giant class amongst the top 3 or 4 world wide).
3. Field work going well, hinting at other discoveries that look as big or bigger than Corvette on surface, but need to be drilled to verify.
4. New discoveries have similar mineralogy and chemistry to Corvette, indicating a spodumene pegmatite district.
5. Quebec is a pro mining jurisdiction.
6. Mr. Market says ""Show me, I'm from Missouri and I don't pay up for blue sky"", but that will change as assay results begin to flow, and keep flowing through year end.

**My comments:**

* PMET's Corvette property is unique among a handful of giant pegmatite lithium deposits world wide with its coarse spodumene dominant mineralogy.
* Preliminary metallurgical testing at Corvette shows that the minerology of grades that exceed 0.4% lithium are 86% to 99% pure spodumene (lithium bearing ore) that has lithium concentrate recovery of &gt;90%.
* This is in contrast to the monster hard rock deposits in Australia and Argentina. These other large deposits are typically 50% spodumene and the other 50% are lepidolite and petalite (lithium mixed with mica), which are very difficult to separate lithium from. In fact, the major mines in Australia park the petalite tailings in piles in hopes that - someday - metallurgical studies will figure out a way to separate the lithium in a manner that is cost-effective.
* This minerology, along with the expanding size of the resource will make Corvette coveted among the largest lithium producing companies, very likely in the top five lithium mines worldwide.
* Additional information is available at the sub for $pmet."|0.9|38|0|38

**Champlain, New York, July 20, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Human Unitec International Inc. (OTC Pink: HMNU) (“Human Unitec"" “HMNU”, or the ""Company"")** announces that on July 25, 2022, it will launch its BCPE (BlockChain Property Enterprises), a tokenization of global real estate opportunities around the world, beginning with its flagship offerings on the beautiful Mediterranean island of Sardinia, Italy and North American Lake Champlain, New York.

The White Paper for BCPE is underway and details how BCPE works for investors—The Company will link, attach and tokenize real estate properties and services, and each property and its related services/amenities will have a different amount of tokens attached accordingly. Customers will be able to invest, rent or buy TOKENS, which will allow them to secure ownership in real estate, but also the ability to secure rights to exclusive rates, services, amenities and perks through implementation of Web3, creating a seamless revenue stream for HMNU and its network of Real Estate properties and related amenities. 

Revenue streams and royalties would be derived from a number of decentralized Web3 based transactions regarding ownership of property, rent, perks, amenities, services, and customizations without a bank or middleman leading to better control and transfer of funds, which may also involve tax advantaged opportunities for investors and token holders all the while. 

Tokenization of real estate investments has several benefits including advanced fluidity, transparency, transaction volume, and security.  These benefits signal a departure from the way things have traditionally been handled within the global luxury real estate and travel industry, along with benefits such as:

Trading Platforms &amp; Online Marketplaces

* No Need For Intermediaries
* Real Estate Becomes A Liquid Asset
* Blockchain Allows Fractional Ownership
* Maximum Security of Blockchain Technology
* Automated Transactions
* Real Estate Smart Contracts

HMNU CEO Kurt Gaensel states, “This is the future of real estate investments and luxury travel, and the future is here. We are thrilled to be tokenizing RE investment opportunities around the world and will focus our efforts on a parallel track for entrance into the Metaverse.  Digital real estate is becoming as important as the physical. 3D models of the building, amenities and services would be a necessity to attract investors and provide immersive, engaging, and gamified opportunities within the space to cultivate exponential value of their involvement and ownership in any given project.”

“Our investors will be able to visit the models virtually, and will allow them to feel as if they are at the estate, with the ability to explore and customize experiences in a fully immersive environment. BCPE token holders will have special benefits and utilities including digital, skins, augmented designs, virtual ownership and endless opportunities to showcase their involvement in a beautiful place within the digital and physical worlds seamlessly”.

“A few of the most amazing things that will revolutionize luxury travel and real estate investment are fractionalized ownership opportunities, in otherwise unattainable investments for some, and revolutionizing real estate ownership as a liquid asset!"|0.66|1|0|1

Canada Nickel Company Inc. today announced the results of a laboratory test program for a new method of accelerated carbon capture – In Process Tailings Carbonation (""IPT Carbonation"") that the Company believes has transformative potential

**Highlight(s)**

* Simple carbon capture approach could allow production of Net Zero nickel and generation of 21 tonnes of CO2 credits per tonne of nickel produced after offsetting all emissions
* Demonstrates potential to turn a nickel mine into a generator of carbon credits rather than generator of carbon emissions
* Crawford Project could produce an estimated average of 710,000 tonnes of CO2 credits annually and 18 million total tonnes of CO2 credits over expected life of mine

**Management Comment**

&gt;""These lab scale test results demonstrate a potentially transformative process to turn a nickel mine into a net generator of carbon credits rather than a generator of carbon emissions. Our active and accelerated process has the potential to operate at least 8-12 times faster than current passive approaches, delivering carbon capture at a multiple of what industry leaders are currently able to achieve. Our process also allows easier quantification and verification of the amount of carbon captured.""

If the company faces well a bearish market, it can be explained because the company is going towards the right way,  notably with the RadonEX Survey on the Pine Channel Uranium Project, which commenced on June 28.

Company Overview

Pegasus Resources owns 4 four Uranium Projects, all located in the prolific Athabasca Basin of Northern Saskatchewan. This area includes a historical resource estimate of 204,200 tons at 0.110% U308 at an average width of 15.8 feet (4.8m), containing 535,718 pounds of uranium.

**Chord Project**: Located in Fall River, South Dakota, the Chord Uranium Property contains 147 lode mining claims totaling 3,037 acres. Historical work at the project indicated resources totaling 2,379,990 lbs. U3O8. Mineralization occurred in three areas and was evaluated by Union Carbide for conventional open pit and underground mining. Pegasus Resources plans to conduct drilling programs after acquiring additional public and identified privately owned data packages. Drilling objectives are to confirm historical Union Carbide results and to explore additional mineralization along projected trends.

**Energy Sands Project**: The Energy Sands project consists of sandstone-hosted UrUraniumnd vanadium mineralization with demonstrated potential to establish resources. This project is approximately 4 kilometers from the Western Uranium’s Rafael Uranium Project, which hosts 758,050 tons of mineral resources averaging 0.225% U3O8 and 0.30% V2O5 (containing 3.4M pounds of U3O8 and 4.6M pounds of V2O5.

The *Wollaston Northeast uranium* property hosts numerous mines and uranium showings, such as Key Lake, Rabbit Lake, Eagle Point, and others. Historic exploration successfully identified multiple uranium/base metal showings, including an unresolved radioactive boulder train at Gallagher Lake with up to **0.244% U3O8.**

The *Bentley Lake Uranium* property is located in the transition zone between the Mudjatic-Wollaston domains, a notable trend as several unique deposits such as Roughrider, Midwest, Cigar Lake, McArthur River, and others. The *Mozzie Lake Uranium* property has a historical resource estimate at the 20A zone with 204,200 tons at 0.119% U308 at an average width of 15.8 feet (4.8 meters), containing 535,718 pounds of uranium.

**Golden Project**: The Gold Project garners three properties along a trend located along the British Alberta border. If this project doesn’t include uranium claims, it comprises gold, silver, and other mineral claims on three properties:

*Golden Mountain* property: it is an early-stage gold/silver property containing two claims which cover 802 had;

*Vertebrae Ridge* property: it consists of 2 mineral claims totaling over 2,871 ha;

*Punch Bowl* property: this property gathers three mineral claims and covers 3,079 ha. The property surrounds the historic Punch Bowl, where discrete quart-gold veins are hosted within quartzites and perlites of the McNaughton Formation.

Those projects eventually discovered two significant uranium occurrences: the J-Zone at Waterbury Lake and the Triple R uranium deposit at PLS.

Recent News

June 28, 2022: the company announced that it had commenced the RadonEX survey on its Pine Channel Uranium Project, located in the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan. “We are excited to be starting the RadonEX survey on Pine Channel,” stated Chris Timmins, President of Pegasus. “A previous RadonEX survey identified exploration targets on the Patterson Lake trend for Fission Uranium Corporation and Nexgen Energy Ltd., leading to the discovery of additional zones, including the Triple R Zone. We look forward to identifying exploration targets and following up on them.”

June 22, 2022: On this day, Pegasus closed the transactions with Trillium Gold Mines and Imagine Lithium. Trillium paid Pegasus $20,000 in cash and issued 100,000 common shares in the capital of Trillium to earn into certain option agreements that Trillium. Further, upon closing, Imagine giving 1,500,000 common shares to Pegasus. Further to Imagine’s receipt of TSXV approval, Imagine delivered to Pegasus $150,000 cash and 1,000,000 common shares of Imagine. Similarly, Pegasus received TSXV approval on May 11, 2022, for issuing Imagine of 5,000,000 common shares in the capital of Pegasus.

Conclusion

Pegasus Resources (PEGA.V) owns many uranium projects, a material needed for the future, combined with gold/silver, the most reliable commodities. The recent news releases strengthen the company’s future and show it is headed the right way. The current share price doesn’t reflect the company’s growth and potential. Any bullish signals on the general markets, sectors, or revenues would help the company’s share price to increase. PEGA is a solid long-term hold."|0.6|1|0|1

In 2020 covid crash unprofitable oil companies with debt problems went for insanely low values and I made 10-20-30 baggers off them. They had serious problems, but the stock prices at the time were so low they greatly exaggerated those problems beyond reality.

Today 1.5 PE oil stocks (many of them the same stocks already up 10-20-30 times by April before the recent crash) are as insanely undervalued as they were at the 2020 lows, but safer to buy. For RECAF this is all good news because if oil stocks take off like they did in 2020 its value will go way up all else equal.

Can we conclude, that this stock is undervalued?

With  the expected revenue of $3,000,000 and an OS 101,896,639 = $0.0294 RPS, that's an increase of 147% RPS.

(The share price is now approximately 0.02)

If we assume a more normal level of RPS, such as around 6%, than the share price will be around $0.49/share.

As     you take into account the national average interest rate for savings     accounts is 0.06 percent, according to Bank-rates Nov. 24, 2021.

If we then use a ratio of 1%, which is still more than on your savings account.

Then the share price would be around $2.94/share.

**Float**  57,310,241 /  **Beneficial Shareholder**   505 = is average 113500 shares / **Shareholder.**

The interim analysis was a go/no-go decision by the DSMB. Due to the high efficacy observed in P2 not only the interim analysis but the trial itself was highly anticipated by many to succeed.

**Introduction**

Special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) with strong potential are always on my radar, and I recently came across Aesther Healthcare Acquisition Corporation. This company was formed specifically for the purpose of effecting a merger, making significant stock purchases, or restructuring an existing business.

Since this is a fairly new SPAC, there isn’t a whole lot to tell, but they have announced a definitive merger agreement and released some information on institutional investor weightings that may be of interest.

**Highlights**

The merger agreement recently signed is between Aesther Healthcare Acquisition Corp. and United Gear &amp; Assembly Inc. This company manufactures high precision gears for electric vehicles, and could be an important player in the EV and green energy revolution. When the merger is closed, $AEHA will instead be listed as $EVGT on the Nasdaq, and Aesther Healthcare will become EVGT Ltd. 

Simply Wall St. did an ownership breakdown which may be worth noting:

However, don’t view this fact as a red flag. Name changes with penny stocks can be seen as a warning sign.

Yet in the case of SKYX stock that may not be so. The company is at work on game-changing technology: a safer, smarter way to connect ceiling fans and hanging light fixtures to the electrical outlet. In time, its products could find success. This could translate into big revenue growth for this early-stage company.

It’s down massively since it went public last February. Trading for as much as $16 per share after its debut, it’s now at around $2.3 per share.

* Gold Fields, a South African world-class gold producer has made quite a bit of noise these last couple of weeks as it progresses on the acquision of Yamana Gold, a top US gold producer. This consolidation we'll bring forth a new behemoth in the precious metals industry.

It just got better because they are now mentioning a 100,000 tpa plant to be built overseas and having secured a contract for the industrial waste needed to feed that plant.

Not sure about the purity but let’s say they can sell it for like $5k per ton. That’s $500,000,000 per year in revenue.

Their market cap is currently $124 million.

They are mentioning JVs as well. So not sure what their cut would be. But even if only half of that was profit it’s still double their current market cap in earnings in one single year.

It is likely this will change due to geo political politics. Vital Metals (VML) is an alternative rare earth supplier. They have a new contract, are cash positive and run by an ex Lynas team, an established mining company. 

VITAL METALS
Rare earth producer.
https://vitalmetals.com.au

A short summary:

What are Rare Earth Elements?
REEs are used in a variety of industrial applications, including electronics, clean energy, aerospace, automotive and defence.


Why Vital Metals?
China is the worlds largest supplier of rare metals (some estimate 85%). With global tension increasing with China alternate suppliers are key to maintaining a steady supply or rare earth.

Vital Metals is run by an ex Lynas rare earth team headed by Geoff Atkins. Lynas has a proven track record in this area. 

Vital Metals is Canada’s first – and North America’s second – rare earths producer, with production underway at Nechalacho in June 2021. Aiming to produce a minimum 5,000 tonnes of contained REO at Nechalacho by 2025.

The deposit is being explored is one of the highest grades of rare earth in the world.

Vital has revived an interest free loan of $5 million from the Canadian government for the project and has close ties with the indigenous community’s land that the mine sits on.

Vital has an agreement to sell REEtec 2,000 tonnes of rare earth carbonate, containing 750t NdPr, a year from 2023 which includes a share of product margin.

REEtec has signed a purchase agreement to supply rare metals for magnets used in electric motors to German auto parts supplier Schaeffler. 

Schaeffler is a world leader in the supply of electric drivetrains to hybrid and electric vehicles. 

Vital’s other projects include the high-grade Wigu Hill rare earth resource in Tanzania.

(OTCQB: SMME): Mastercard has announced that by 2024 card issuers will no longer be required to use magnetic stripes on their credit and debit cards. “Based on the decline in payments powered by magnetic stripes after chip-based payments took hold, newly-issued Mastercard credit and debit cards will not be required to have a stripe starting in 2024 in most markets.”1

“Based on the decline in payments powered by magnetic stripes after chip-based payments took hold, newly-issued Mastercard credit and debit cards will not be required to have a stripe starting in 2024 in most markets.”
Tweet this
Storing customer credit card information on a magnetic stripe creates another insecure touch point in the credit and debit card transaction data flow ecosystem when using a card to make a payment. Now that chip-based cards that store the card's number, expiration date and card users name amongst other things, the need to use highly vulnerable magnetic stripes has become a dinosaur legacy technology for today's high-tech credit and debit cards according to SmartMetric.

“Combining the secure chip used now on credit and debit cards with a biometric reader inside the card that is used to identify the card user in order to 'turn on the card' makes the next-generation credit card such as what we have created as an incredibly more secure card for use in the payments industry,” said today SmartMetric’s President and CEO, Chaya Hendrick.

“In fact, our new biometric technology inside the card not only replaces the need for magnetic stripes but replaces the highly vulnerable four-digit PIN that is still used today,” said Chaya Hendrick.

“Fingerprint biometrics and the secure payment chip along with the abandonment of insecure card features as the PIN and the magnetic stripe go to providing a massive hardening of the credit and debit card against the ever-menacing fraudsters according to SmartMetric.

SmartMetric’s Biometric card addresses the multibillion existing chip-based credit and debit card market. Figures published by EMVCo 2 reveal that by year end of 2020, 10.8 billion EMV® chip cards have been issued by financial institutions and were in global circulation – a massive increase of nearly 1 billion credit and debit EMV® cards compared to the previous twelve months."|1.0|2|0|2

COVID-19 is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new virus in humans causing respiratory illness which can be spread from person-to-person. Early in the outbreak, many patients were reported to have a link to a large seafood and live animal market; however, later cases with no link to the market confirmed person-to-person transmission of the disease. Additionally, travel-related exportation of cases occurred.Since then, many biotech companies have started to research on ways to fight against Covid 19.

**Abbott (NYSE: ABT)**

Abbott has announced the launch of its third COVID-19 test, a lab-based serology blood test for the detection of the antibody, IgG, that identifies if a person has had the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Antibody testing is an important next step to tell if someone has been previously infected. It will provide more understanding of the virus, including how long antibodies stay in the body and if they provide immunity. This type of knowledge could help support the development of treatments and vaccines.

**Adaptive Biotechnologies (NASDAQ:ADPT)**

Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Adaptive Biotechnologies (NASDAQ:ADPT) announced a collaboration aimed at helping address the COVID-19 pandemic. The companies will combine expertise to discover and develop fully-human neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 to potentially prevent or treat COVID-19. The mutually exclusive collaboration brings together Adaptive’s proprietary immune medicine platform for the identification of virus-neutralizing antibodies with Amgen’s expertise in immunology and novel antibody therapy development.

**Regencell Bioscience (NASDAQ:RGC)**

Founded in 2014, Hong Kong-based Regencell Bioscience is an early clinical stage bioscience company using traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approach to develop standardized TCM formulas to holistically treat autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, and infectious diseases which affects the immune system such as COVID-19.

The formulae candidates aim to address the fundamental causes of disorders while alleviating symptoms and improving overall health at the same time. Taking a holistic approach, RGC's TCM uses natural ingredients to treat different elements in the body and every bodily function is taken into consideration when preparing the TCM formulae for patients.

Unlike some early-stage companies, where it can be difficult to parse the many ways in which founders and executives may benefit whether or not the company succeeds, RGC has taken a more transparent approach that is well-aligned with shareholders' long-term interests.

$PVSP has been trading above its support ($.0015) for about a month now. They release earnings tomorrow.

PVSP is the owner of Artizen Cannabis, a top shelf cannabis brand based in Washington. They won Dockside’s Cannabis Cup and were recognized as a top 10 house brand by MJ magazine. 

They have selected partners for licensing deals to expand to other states (and countries). Partners have been selected in Canada, New York, Cali, and Oregon. More partners to be announced in the future. Low capital investment, will take in ~10-12% of revenue as profit (https://youtu.be/2Kj-jp2_8HQ). 

Highly recommend watching the video if you made it this far :)

Slightly bloated share structure, but management doesn’t plan on issuing shares to raise capital until the company is fairly valued. For reference, the old CEO set the conversion price for his debt at .01, while the company is trading between .0015 and .0019. 

The current share price gives PVSP a market cap under $10 million. They have done $17 million per year the last 2 years in revenue, giving it an extremely attractive Price/ Sales IMO. I’d recommend reading through their recent news headlines and disclosures on OTC Markets … https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/PVSP/news/.

t3_vz88kn|1657837543|pennystocks|Solo Brands $DTC offers a great opportunity. The current set up is aligning perfectly for a good price action at Aug Q2 earnings Call. I try to explain everything in detail in this DD, feedback appreciated!|"# Hi there,

In this DD, I will try to methodically point out, why $DTC is coming closer and closer to a really big bounce and which indicator are pointing to this outcome right now. The stock market isn't a pure guessing game and I hope you take the time to listen to my theory and I appreciate any constructive feedback.

So in the past 6 month $DTC\`s share price was falling over 75%, into heavily undervalued territory. As typical with the market, it usually overreacts to the downside, before it overreacts to the upside.

[Since IPO we saw a falling knife until mid May, when the CEO and CFO bough 140k shares and the chart made a technical trend reversal.](https://preview.redd.it/mmazqnrlnlb91.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99a5af1f54e9530cc21f4b3b6a753070126c26f6)

In my opinion we are about to witness the upside overreaction. First of all, we were able to reliably stop the downward trend and consolidated for two month now. In this time an upwards trend channel developed, which is a good indicator.

Another great thing happend, yesterday the official Short interest numbers by the Nyse were released. They showed us, that from the 15th of June to the 30th of Jun over 500k new short positions were opened. From 2.6M SI to 3.1M SI . 500k shares sold short are a huge amount, considering the avr. daily volume is only slightly above 500k, yet the share price further increased in that timeframe. From 3.80$ to 4.06$, this means shorts are desperately trying everything to keep $DTC down, because once it starts to spiral up, they will lose control and it will create a positive feedback loop, similiar to $rdbx, $bkkt or $sprt. The share price increase in this types of squeezes is related to exponential curves, at first slow, but with rapid acceleration. 

Ofc, I cannot predict the intensity of the upcoming run, no-one can tell if the share price will 3x or 10x, but as long as the share price steadily increases, there is no other possibility, but a nice big squeeze.

# Cant they just keep kicking the can down the road?

That's an excellent and often misunderstood question. In theory ofc they can keep the stock price low for a long time. But this type of manipulation is quite expensive for short seller and comes with an opportunity cost. So in DTC´s case it doesn't make sense, because the costs to manipulate are higher than the expected gains. The explanation therefor is a little complicated, but I will do my best to clarify one of the biggest misconceptions in retail.

If you have stocks, that already squeezed, like $GME $AMC, $RDBX for example, those stocks are highly overvalued in regard to their fundamental fair valuation. Because short sellers expect the stock price to reach the (lower) fair valuation in the future, they keep manipulating the stock for a while  until their respective stock reaches the lower share price. For example in case of $rdbx, they wait for the $CSSE merger, which puts the $rdbx shares in the penny range, for that matter they just keep doubling down, until their desired event happend.

Or if you look at $GME/$AMC, which are heavily manipulated from the first big squeezes onward. Shortseller expect the hype to slowly die down and bet on every subsequent squeeze to get lower and lower, therefor they close their short positions on each dip of those meme stocks and reopen their short positions whenever they are going to make another spike. 

Ofc there are many other scenarios in which it might be worth for shorts to keep a stock down in the long term, but as long as they dont close their positions they bleed money and dont cash in profits (in case the specific stock is below their shorting price)

In the case of $DTC we had no squeeze yet and shorts have massive unrealized gains at the moment, since their average short position was opened in the 7$ price range. However they did miss calculated $DTC\`s business model, by expecting $DTC to go bankrupt. Unfortunately for them the opposite happend and $DTC beat their earnings Call the past two times and Q2 went so well, that even the CEO and CFO bought over half a million dollar in shares end of May.

Now the best thing for shorts would be to slowly cover their positions and take nice profits home. But humans are greedy, the short seller are still hoping for some improbably event, that could tank $DTC and save their asses. Also, because of the ultra low volume they need over 5.44 Day to Cover all their short positions, so they keep shorting the stock against all odds.

This is great for us, as the same thing happened with $SPRT a few weeks before it took off, increasing short interest, together with increasing share price is the perfect recipe for a huge squeeze.

Mathematically there is no way for short seller to take a lot of profits, by closing out short positions, without shooting $DTC\`s share price into the sky. Once $DTC issues their next earnings call and appears on the radar of Wallstreet, heavy volume will kick in and the price is going to take off, forcing remaining short seller to buy back their shares or risk losing all their profits. Which either way will be good for us.

One last thing, unfortunately Ortex and Fintel both rely on the Data broker Capital IQ, who has calculated the wrong free float for $DTC, they come up with 14.7M shares, because they treat Class B shares same as Class A shares, this however is a big mistake. Therefore I recommend using S3 analystics or Bloomberg Terminal, who report the real SI % which lies at 35% To be sure I went through all the 13F ownership filings by myself and the real free float is 7.45M shares.

[Since May we made a stable upwards trend channel, the Current low point offers a great ](https://preview.redd.it/4pcmiw6lnlb91.png?width=1055&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df6a9b9e54ef02c410bcb392de71f1c6956b0c2e)

In the current Trend channel every dip offers a great entry point until August earnings, when the bigger price action is to be expected.The management affirmed their 2022 guidance in May and expect a positive free cash flow:

***Guidance for Full Fiscal Year 2022***

**Total revenue** is expected to be between $540 million to $570 million.

**Adjusted EBITDA\*** is expectedto be between $121 million to $132 million.

I know I am writing about $DTC for 2 month now, but everything is lining up perfectly to explode in a few weeks, all I write is based on my opinion, however I put my money were my mouth is."|0.67|3|0|3

Hi Reddit!

I’m Dennis Calvert, President and CEO of BioLargo, Inc. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk with you today and answer your questions. It’s so wonderful to see this community grow on Reddit as well as on platforms like Discord. The extensive research and healthy discussions here have not escaped our notice, and we think communities like this are so valuable and important to help folks learn about our company’s mission, our technologies, and our products.

For those who don’t know me, I am the President and CEO of BioLargo. I am what you might call a serial entrepreneur. I started my career in sales and business development, then spent the next decade in M&amp;A, finance, operations, and strategy. I have worked with companies like Diamond Shamrock, helped start and build the nation’s leading physician search firm, and then went on to complete over 50 acquisitions in the medical and telecommunications industry. I have experienced success and a few setbacks along the way. All of my prior experiences helped hone the skills I’ve used throughout my career. Those skills became especially critical when we started our BioLargo journey in the spring of 2007 when the first BioLargo technology was purchased and we began to build what we expect will be known around the world as a cleantech powerhouse that makes an impact for a greater good.  

At BioLargo, I am especially thankful to work with a small army of highly trained and talented people, to be able to focus on high impact purposeful innovation, and to continue assembling the tools and talent to create what we believe can and will lead to massive shareholder value as we serve our customers and partners around the globe. People who know me well know that I am an eternal optimist and see hurdles as challenges to be overcome, and once they are overcome, they create a daunting barrier to entry for those that come behind to compete. Along with our founding executives, I am “all in” with BioLargo, continuing to convert salary to equity when needed, not selling a share of stock since inception, and driving our mission to create an enduring high impact success and generate shareholder value. We are well on our way! 

In my personal life – I am married to my high school sweetheart (who I met in grade school), having just celebrated our 36-year anniversary. We have two awesome children successfully making their way in the world. I was fortunate to play basketball at Wake Forest University in the mid 1980’s with and against some future NBA superstars, where I studied economics. It was there I also came to realize that I probably would not make a living as a basketball player and better learn how to make some money! I am passionate about philanthropy and cleantech advocacy, serving on the boards of organizations such as Tilly’s Life Center, The Maximum Impact Foundation, TMA BlueTech, Sustain SoCal, and Water UCI (University of Irvine). 

**For those of you who are new to BioLargo:**

At BioLargo we invent, develop, and commercialize sustainable technologies that solve some of the toughest environmental challenges in the world – such as water contamination by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), the “forever chemicals” afflicting thousands of drinking water sources across the United States and more throughout the world. We have patented assets, in various stages of commercialization, in areas like air quality control, odor and VOC mitigation, water treatment, wound control, *Legionella* mitigation, and more. 

A great intro to BioLargo is available on our YouTube channel here: [https://youtu.be/ke\_L-Tm\_kPE](https://youtu.be/ke_L-Tm_kPE) 

And of course, learn more about the company at [www.biolargo.com](http://www.biolargo.com/). 

Our company’s stock is publicly traded on the OTC Markets venture exchange (the OTCQB), under the symbol BLGO. We have remained current on our required quarterly and annual reports with the SEC – you can find those at [www.biolargo.com/sec-filings](http://www.biolargo.com/sec-filings), and should look there for the most up-to-date information about us, including our audited financial statements.

t3_vys86c|1657792986|pennystocks|Latrobe Magnesium DD|"LMG.AX (Australian Ticker)

I’ll keep it short and sweet. The company has a current market cap of roughly 116 million (Australian dollars).

They’re working on a pilot plant to convert industrial waste into high grade magnesium and will also be generating other commercially viable byproducts in the process.

In 2001 magnesium hit a value of $10,000 per ton. It’s hard to find accurate numbers and I’m lazy, but I’m estimating it at around 5-6000 per ton now. Could go up or down but let’s say it’s about 5,000 per ton right now.

They already completed a feasibility study (their magnesium production method is unique and also greener than other options) so the play is partially de-risked in a sense.

Their demonstration plant will produce 1000 TPA (1000 tons per annum/1000 tons per year). Production starts in Q2 2023 I believe though I’m sure COVID will do what it does best and delay that.

That’s revenue of about 5 million per year on the low end.

If the demonstration plant is successful the plan is for another plant to be built producing 10,000 TPA.

That’s 10,000 times 5,000 which is 50 million in revenue per year.

That’s potential for 50,000,000 per year on a 116,000,000 market cap right now.

Some of that is already priced in however Australian producers usually end up with a market cap of 5-10x their annual revenue. Which means on the lower end they have the potential for a market cap of 250,000,000 which could make it a solid 2 bagger over the next couple years. If the cost of magnesium explodes again that could make it about a 4 bagger. That’s assuming the price over earnings or whatnot stays on the lower end and the cost of magnesium stays on the lower end.

Of course I’m willing to bet that if they have success they will either keep building new plants or form JVs with the licenses for their new extraction method to increase their revenue year over year.

My play: Get ripped off by TD bank for $215 in commission to buy an international stock (there is a US OTC ticker but it looks illiquid as fuck so I don’t know what’s up with that and all my brokers said that ticker was a no go despite not explaining why). Buy. Set. Forget for 1-2 years and then re-evaluate.

Positions: 6,500 shares at $0.079 AUD.

Of course there is always a risk with what’s basically a startup and it could go tits up for whatever reason. But I’m comfortable taking the risk on a small position. I like to imagine wild scenarios where the $0.08 stock goes to $5 and I get rich. One can dream."|0.71|3|0|3

(TSXV: APN) (WKN: A2JNFG) (“**Altiplano**” or the “Company”) is pleased to report the intersection of the 352 m mining level as part of the ongoing development of the Hugo Decline at the Farellon copper gold mine located near La Serena, Chile.

Cross cuts from the 352 m level have intersected the Farellon Iron Oxide Copper Gold vein structure with production headings now established on the northeast and southwest directions. Mining in this area has begun along with benching operations continuing between the roofs and floors of the 360 m and 368 m levels. Further development of the Hugo Decline to the 344 m level is expected to begin in the next four weeks with a time frame of approximately 12 weeks to reach the new targeted intersection.

CEO Alastair McIntyre comments: “Ongoing development is part of our sustainability work at Farellon. Advancing to lower levels of the mine provides access to additional working faces which improves our ability to manage grade control and productivity. Going forward, the copper-gold-iron material extracted from these lower levels will form the bulk of the shipments to feed the newly commissioned El Peñón processing facility."""|0.83|18|0|18
