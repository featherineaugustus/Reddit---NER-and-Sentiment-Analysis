A trader buys two $340 calls expiring 11/18. The price per call is $66.13 for a total debit of $13,226. 

Over the next few days, the underlying stock for the option does not move in the direction the trader had hoped. 

The trader finds that the $335 call is selling for $66.45 with a breakeven at $401.82. The credit for selling two would be $13,290. To hedge his position in the $340 call, could the trader sell two of the $335 options?

If so, what would be the maximum potential loss and maximum potential gain?"|0.75|4|0|4

t3_wxxgkx|1661482376|RobinHood|my investing journey (2 years so far)|So let me take you back to the beginning. I started researching stocks and everything to go with when I was probably around 16 as it always interested to me. Fast forward to when I turned 18 the day of I invest my birthday money into the stock market (VTI/VOO) as those where the best for me. For further context this was March of 2020 when covid hit, soon after my $300 had fell to low one hundreds. It scared me a bit but I kept doing my research and decided to invest more when everything was on sale. I then put 200 more in and rode with that for awhile. My then $500 became $700, invested more then I hit 900 then 1000 now I'm where I'm at. I plan on investing more and taking more risk maybe a few more DIV stocks. Let me know if you have any questions I'm glad to answer. And for me what DIV stocks should I research into? And more risky stocks?|0.91|203|0|203

Thursday after hours, bought 50 shares.

t3_wmuehd|1660334282|RobinHood|Silly Question about day trading|" Robinhood says:

Pattern Day Trading restrictions don’t apply to cash accounts. They only apply to margin accounts, like Robinhood Instant accounts and accounts that have margin investing enabled. This means you can trade stocks, ETPs, and options without worrying about your number of day trades.

You can switch to a cash account from both a margin investing enabled account or a limited margin account (Robinhood Instant). Keep in mind that if your account is margin investing enabled you will not be able to switch to Cash account if you have a margin balance. In the app, navigate to the **Account tab** → **Menu** → **Investing** → **Day trade settings** → **Switch to cash account**.

On the web, navigate to the **Account tab** → **Settings** → **Investing** → **Account type** → **Switch to the cash account**.

The question is....with a Cash Account less than 25000 K on Robinhood Could I day trade without being tagged as a data trader?"|1.0|3|0|3

The spread tends to be about $100 to $200 so at worst this is a misrepresentation of the price by about 1%. For those not mathematically inclined, that's about $1 loss per $100 sold.|0.83|4|0|4

t3_waeuj6|1659026885|RobinHood|First Thousand Margin Question|"So, back in October 2021, I used my first thousand of margin where it had no interest. And overtime I've paid it down to around $400.

But ive added $200 of margin back since January and I've yet to get hit with any interest payments. So I'm confused on what the first thousand of margin means is interest free, because technically I've now borrowed $1,200, so I would think I'd be charged interest on the $200

Is there a loophole where as long as the current amount being borrowed doesn't go over $1,000, you'll never be charged interest? Or am I just gonna get hit with an interest charge on that $200 when it reaches a certain amount? Hope this makes sense. Thanks in advance."|0.69|7|0|7

how do you profit?? Do you get to buy the stock at the current price and then sell it at the put option price? For some reason this concept has me struggling."|1.0|6|0|6

t3_uvseim|1653281049|RobinHood|I need help with a school assignment|"For my economics class, we have a final project where we have to play the Investopedia market simulator where you get $100 000 and you are only allowed to buy stocks and ETFs. We are not graded on how much money we make, but every student in the class, including the teacher, is competing against each other to see who makes the most money. This project will only last two weeks, and I really want to win. If this was a whole year thing, then my strategy would just be to buy safe things and hold until the end of the year, but because of the short time we have, I'm not sure what to do. So my strategy has been just to diversify as much as possible, where I'm spending about $1000 per company, and I'm not buying ETFs as they are generally more stable so for the time constraint I don't think they are a good idea. But I'm not sure what to do. So if anyone has advice, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you"|0.67|1|0|1

t3_ulwqlm|1652118025|RobinHood|Margin Call doesn’t go away even after selling 3-times the margin deficit|"I am one of those people who was incredibly bullish on growth stocks. I kept on buying the dips throughout 2022 and starting a week or so ago, I actually ran out of my money and maxed the margin. (currently, my portfolio uses $2 margin for every $1 of my own money). So this morning, I got a margin call for under $5k. To solve this, I first sold $9k of stocks. The margin didn’t go away but then got reduced to $2.5k. Just to be safe, I sold another $9k worth of stocks. However, that didn’t solve the issue either and I still have $1k worth of deficit. All this selling happened within a 15 minute window, so I can’t understand why selling $18k worth of stocks is not enough to cover $5k margin call. 

Has anyone had anything like this happen and know what is going on?

Let’s say I have a 100 shares of a stock and for simple math for it is at $10. I sell a covered call for strike price of $12 at a date of 5/6 and collect the premium, I decided then to enter into a butterfly spread of that same stock since I think it will either fall/rise in the next week and sell a $15 and a $5 call and buy 2x $10 calls at a strike date of 4/22 for all the contracts. 

So the stock now is $9 on 4/22. Should the $5 call option exercise since it is above $5 and do you sell all 100, or is it still tied up in the covered call that you previously wrote?"|0.69|15|0|15

t3_tn0g9w|1648152071|RobinHood|I bought my first Call. Did I just lose $100?|"TLDR; if an option has been ‘cancelled’ does that mean I’ve lost the initial investment? 

I’m new to trading/investing. I’ve been getting to know it over the past year.  After a year of being afraid of Options, I want to branch out and try a little harder to understand them.

Edit

Date for the option is 4/1

I set my strike price at $1 so Robinhood app says that the “Max Loss” is $100. I realize the price for my stock probably won’t get to $1, I did so because $100 was worth the loss to learn how Robinhood is set up. Frankly I think it’s better—and smarter than losing $30,000 as I see is possible."|0.48|0|0|0
t3_tmk3y7|1648138175|RobinHood|Hypothetical question about options:|Say you buy 100 shares of stock A at 2.30 a share for a total of $230. You then sell a covered call, same day, with a strike price of 2.5. The premium you got was $2(since the expiry was tomorrow). The stock jumps up to 2.55 a share, so the option you wrote gets executed. So you sell the shares for 2.5 each, profiting 20 dollars on the stock itself, and 2 dollars on the premium for 22 dollars. But now my question is, does that count as a day trade since you technically bought and sold the same stock in the same market day?|0.69|19|0|19

They laughed when Billionaire Investor **Carl C. Icahn**, when he decided to make an investment in a mail order video company called **Netflix**...

I am no **Carl C. Icahn**, but I do know how to read a Vision, monitor a Chart and see the possibilities of growth - HUGE growth and if you have not logged into $RDBX website and seen what is planned for 2022 - YOU are missing out on MONEY my dear fellow and lady Retail Investors - **Redbox Entertainment Inc.** is The Next **Netflix**!!! starting now in War-time, Down Market

Here is what I do know, $RDBX/ **Redbox Entertainment Inc.**, formerly Seaport Global Acquisition Corp., is an entertainment company. The Company provides consumers access to a variety of content across digital and physical media. It operates a digital streaming service that provides both advertising-based video on demand (AVOD) and paid movies from Hollywood studios and content partners, as well as channels of free advertisement supported streaming television (FAST).

As they (RedBox) $RDBX move away from the KIOSK ONLY system as Netflix moved away from mail-order - Its Redbox application is available on entertainment platforms that include Roku devices, connected televisions (TVs), gaming platforms, the Web as well iOS and Android devices.

Redbox application also operates its kiosks across the United States at thousands of retail locations giving consumers access to the entertainment. It produces, acquires, and distributes movies through its Redbox Entertainment label, providing rights to films that are distributed across Redbox’s digital and physical services as well as through third-party digital services.

I don't have a huge position in this stock, but I'd like to dump it so I can invest the money elsewhere. The email said I had two options: 1) Wait until cash liquidation after June 2, which requires me to do nothing and the shares will be sold automatically ""at some point after June 2nd"" and the cash distributed to me or, 2) Transfer the WBK shares to an outside broker, then convert to foreign shares. This option claims that Robinhood will cover the cost of an ACAT transfer to a broker who supports foreign shares, but when asking about this in a follow up email, Robinhood said there was a $75 transfer fee, which is pretty steep for the paltry position I have with this stock.

I'm pretty new to all of this, so I'm trying to figure out what's best to do here. Curious what anyone else did who was stuck with WBK shares. Below is the verbiage of the email:

\---

The Robinhood team wants to let you know about an upcoming corporate action that may affect your account. On June 2nd, 2022, Westpac Banking Corp (WBK) will terminate its ADR program. An ADR (American Depository Receipt) is a foreign stock purchased by an American bank on a foreign exchange to make it available in the United States. In the case of WBK, each ADR represents one foreign share, which is traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. As of January 31st, Westpac ADRs are no longer trading.

Since Robinhood cannot support the underlying Australian shares, Robinhood customers currently have two options:

1) **Wait until cash liquidation after June 2nd.** If you decide to do nothing, the underlying foreign shares will be sold *automatically* by the issuer at some point after June 2nd, and the cash will be distributed to you. You’ll receive the net of proceeds minus any fees and tax withholding charged by the issuer. (These fees are not charged by Robinhood.)

2) **Transfer your WBK shares to an outside broker, and then convert them into foreign shares.** Since Robinhood can’t support the underlying Australian shares, we’ll cover the cost of an ACAT transfer to a broker that supports foreign shares. Please note that you will be responsible for any fees that the outside broker may charge.

t3_te4zqa|1647284516|RobinHood|Getting Assigned on a spread -- Here is how it is done.|"So, if you're like me and not currently in possession of 100 shares of SPY, are trading spreads on it, here is what happens if say, your short position and long position both fall ITM and **your short position becomes assigned to you.**  *Early or at expiration.*

1. First that happens is **Robinhood sells 100 shares on your behalf to whoever owns your short position.  This** leaves you with you a deficit of whatever it cost to buy 100 shares.  So, without a fee of any kind, they literally hook you up with 100 shares of SPY that are worth nearly 50k of shares.  *That said, you still owe them though.*

# To re-pay them, you have a few choices:

1. You can either sell those 100 shares given to you from Robinhood via the market if, at the day of assignment, SPY magically jumps above their short put strike. If this happens and you sell those 100 shares above the short put strike, you'll not only pay off the debt you owe to Robinhood, but you'll have a profit.  However, I wouldn't wait longer than a day to hope this happens.  If it's undoubtedly clear that SPY isn't going to jump up past the short put strike, then it's likely you'll need to exercise your long put with the 100 shares Robinhood fronted you.
2. When you exercise your long position with those 100 shares Robinhood got you, this comes with a massive opportunity cost assuming your long position is months away and a hefty cost.  When you exercise, you lose your long position and the opportunity costs that come with it.  So, for a calendar diagonal, the longer out, the steeper the losses will be on opportunity costs.  However, on the contrary, you're clearing your debt (assuming your long position is either at or further ITM than your short put).  This is good with the respect that you're still making something back, you're not in crazy debt and if you do it right, you can still re-coup your losses.  It would be nice if the difference was so much, that whatever it is, it's more than what you paid for (net total) for your long position. 

# Here is why Opportunity Cost is Important:

* You decide to buy a long SPY put @ 450 on 20 May 2022.  The cost is $3,778. To pay this off, you decide to sell a short put at strike 418 for 3/18 which gives you +$768.  So, your net cost is $3,010 to your long position. Between 3/14 - 5/20, you have 9 weeks and 5 days which for every week, **you can sell two SPY puts each week** which, over this time period not only pays off the cost of the long position within a few weeks, but with the remaining weeks, that's all profit.  Now, let's just assume that the next day after buying your first short position, 3/18, SPY magically drops from 420 to 390 and the owner of your short put has decided to assign the position (exercise their position).  Since, I have to buy 100 shares of SPY at 419 and I don't have the cash or stock to do this, ***Robinhood fronts me the 100 shares*** which gives me a deficit of ($41,900).  **Now, there are two ways to rectify this debt.**  I can either sell the 100 shares outright to the market or I can exercise my long position with those 100 shares.  If I decided to exercise my long position, I would take these 100 shares given to me from Robinhood and my long position which allows me to sell 100 shares at $450 per share which means I get $45,000.  With $45,000 in cash, I cover my debt to Robinhood leaving me with a surplus of $3,100. Now, here's where opportunity cost happens: Originally, I paid $3,010 for that long position (after selling the short position).  With the surplus difference made from exercising my long position ($3,100) to pay off the short assigned position, I am left with a $90 profit when we factor in how much it cost to buy the long position (plus what I sold the short put for). Even though I have technically $3,100 in cash, with opportunity cost, I actually run a significant negative because of the opportunity cost this long position could of brought me. Assuming SPY hovered between 410 and 430 until May, this would of been $400-$600 (maybe more, maybe less) the long position would of been paid off in a few weeks with several more all for making profit.  For example, if I paid off the long position in 4 weeks, I would have 5 weeks of selling two short positions each week that would be all profit never minding what intrinsic value my long position has itself. If I made (hypothetically), $800 a week, paid off my long position by week four, I would have five more weeks to keep selling two options each week.  If the price per short position was $400-$600 for, we'd be looking at roughly a 5-7k grand profit by May.  So, I lost the potential to make this amount because the original cost for a long SPY @ 450 on 20 May 2022 was $3.7k.  I have $3.1k after everything happened and no long position. 
* ***The opportunity cost ultimately lost was $9,000 plus (or minus)*** whatever the premium would yield itself provided the long position benefitted from the direction SPY moved up to then.  So, **this is why getting assigned early on a calendar or vertical spread early sucks!**  Even though I can do the same thing again with $3,100, I won't make as much as I could of before.  By looking at this situation in terms of opportunity costs, I was able to see what I could of made versus what I ended up making because of someone's choice to assign me.  

# How to NOT exercise your long position while covering your assigned short put if A) you don't already own 100 shares of SPY B) have the funds to get it (with the spread above):

Consider everything said above.  If assigned, you're given 100 shares by Robinhood and now in debt -$41,900.  Let's assume all this happens on a Friday after the closing bell and that 3/18 419 Short SPY put expires ITM.  The person has 100 shares of SPY and the position gets exercised.  The closing price of SPY is $390 and come opening bell Monday morning, SPY magically gapes up to 425.  I can now sell all 100 shares of SPY for $42,500 and cover my debt plus make a profit while keeping my long position.  This is literally the best case scenario.  I don't have the exact time Robinhood waits around for you to fix the debt, but I'd imagine by within a day, any cash, stock and other positions you have open all become liquidated to help pay the bill they financed for you.

If you're new or slow, or both, and you happen to sell 100 share below 419, you'll not only be on debt to Robinhood still, but you'll now not be able to exercise your long position to close the short position.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR

\-What happens when my short position becomes assigned via Robinhood?  Robinhood fronts you the money and buys the 100 shares at whatever strike price the short position is at.  This comes without a fee.

\-If SPY, the day off, magically increases above the short position's strike price, you can just sell those 100 SPY shares given to you by Robinhood to clear your debt to Robinhood (and keep any remaining profit if it is higher than the short's strike price).

\-If SPY clearly isn't going higher than the short put the day your assigned or even after and you don't exercise your long position with the 100 shares given to you from Robinhood, they will start liquidating your portfolio, cash, and anything else that can pay the balance."|0.84|8|0|8

Also given my borrowing limit is set to 15k why has RH allowed me to reach total margin of almost 16k (and still giving me $1500 of buying power?)

t3_t4hk6k|1646166720|RobinHood|Confused about Margins - Help!|"Hi there,

Need some help on this situation and for some reason Robinhood doesn't want to talk to me. Basically I had margins available but I never used it because I had enough cash. I withdrew 25K to put into my bank account and a month later my portfolio shows as the following: 

Equity: 16K

Margin Used: 24K 

Do I owe Robinhood 8K? I don't understand why this would switch to Margin used if I had enough cash and now I'm freaking out about this. If I were to sell everything, is that my 16K but I still owe 24K?  It shows my total MV at around 40K now.

""represents more than 6% of your total trades in the margin account for that same five business day period."""|"What do they mean 6% of total trades? The **number of trades** or the **total spent**? Or total percentage gain of **profits**?

I'm trying to figure out if a will be label a PDT (and restricted) coming next Tuesday. I have 4 day trades on Robinhood. 

What I read online:

According to FINRA rules, you are considered a pattern day trader if you execute four or more ""day trades"" within five business days—*provided that the number of day trades represents* ***more than six percent of your total trades*** *in the margin account for that same five business day period.* 

Robinhood:

You’ll be considered a pattern day trader if you execute 4 or more day trades within 5 trading days, provided that **the number of day trades represents more than 6% of your total trades within your margin account for that same 5 trading day period.**

So if i made a 2 day swing trade for 2k. that's **1 trade**? The amount doesn't count? vs **4 day trades** on $10 dollars each?"|0.62|13|0|13
