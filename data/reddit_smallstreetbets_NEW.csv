(TSXV: EVGN | OTCQB: EVGIF)...let's talk about their facilities now and in the future"|"Hello again all, I have come on here and spoken about EverGen and what it is they do. I realized that it is quite a b it more complex than your grandpa's mutual fund he is trying to get you to invest in. With that being said, I am going to briefly go over their current facilities and what they have planned.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you mean by *facilities*?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, my curious friend, I mean to say the company's Core Projects where the actual activity takes place (the Anaerobic Digestive (AD) process and any additional upgrading).

&amp;#x200B;

**Core Project 1: Net Zero Waste Abbotsford (NZWA) - Operational Organics Processing Facility**

&gt;\- Current capacity: 40K tonnes/yr  
\- Expansion to: 135K tonnes/yr  
\- RNG: 180K tonnes/yr  
\- 20 yr FortisBC Offtake Secured  
\- Long-lead items secured  
\- Construction of an AD --&gt; blended feedback from agricultural, municipal, and commercial organic waste

&amp;#x200B;

**Core Project 2: Fraser Valley Biogas (FVB) - Operational RNG Facility**

&gt;\- Current capacity: 50K tonnes/yr  
\- RNG (2020): 80K GJ/yr  
\- Expansion: 100K tonnes/yr  
\- RNG: 160K GJ/yr  
\- Existing FortisBC Offtake (w/10 yr history)  
\- Processes farm and non-farm organic waste to energy  
\- AD facility w/blended feedstock from agricultural and commercial organic waste

&amp;#x200B;

**Core Project 3: Sea to Sky Soils (SSS) - Operational Organics Processing Facility**

&gt;\- Current cap: 40K tonnes/yr  
\- Expansion to: 60K tonnes/yr  
\- Application submitted to expand permitted capacity  
\- Existing compost facility operated in partnership w/Lil'wat First Nation --&gt; feedstock from municipal and agricultural waste

&amp;#x200B;

**Core Project 4: GrowTec (67% of Operational RNG facility)**

&gt;\- Phase 1 Capacity: 80K GJ/yr  
\- Expansion to: 140K GJ/yr  
\- Phase 1 development, phase 2 expansion planned  
\- Operating farm scale AD that converts biodegradable waste into biogas  
\- RNG offtake contracted with FortisBC

&amp;#x200B;

The main takeaway here is the company seems to have a robust handle on operations with a clear pathway to growth. This is clearly an infrastructure heavy business model that requires complex inputs and produces complex outputs. As well, the output (RNG) has a current demand that will only accelerate supported by government mandates to shift to RNG consumption over traditional natural gas. However, it seems to be offset by the ability to use existing infrastructure which allows for scaling as well as a world leading team that is well versed in these disciplines."|1.0|4|0|4

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, lets go over what they **DO**!  
$RMTI, or Rockwell Medical, is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the treatment of iron deficiency and anemia. The WHO estimates that 42% of children less than 5 years of age and 40% of pregnant women worldwide are anemic, and I think we all know a few people AT LEAST that are anemic/have an iron deficiency. So, there is a LARGE demographic and potential user-base.   


""Rockwell Medical‚Äôs vision to establish a new standard of care in iron deficiency and anemia management is built on our novel and differentiated core technology platform, **Ferric Pyrophosphate Citrate (FPC)**. Our¬†initial focus is the treatment of anemia in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Rockwell Medical¬†has developed the exclusive drug therapy, **Triferic¬Æ** (ferric pyrophosphate citrate), **which is the only FDA-approved** therapeutic indicated for iron replacement and maintenance of hemoglobin in hemodialysis patients.""  


What stands out to me, is the ""....**which is the only FDA-approved**...."" part. That is quite big &amp; carries a lot of weight in this industry of medicine/technology. Along with the fact that they conduct business in 6 countries (the US, India, China, Peru, Chile, &amp; Canada), this company has tons of room for growth, increased revenue opportunities, networking, and more. If you would like to read up more on their tech, go [here](https://www.rockwellmed.com/our-technology/technology-platform/). That's a brief summary of what they do, from a product &amp; technology perspective. Now, onto the financials.  


With a market cap of only $17.6M, this company has tons of room to run and become a gem in your portfolio. Now, this is a smaller company so don't expect to see millions of dollars of cash on hand, in fact when companies are in this stage of growth I personally don't like to see lots of cash on hand. It shows they are reinvesting into the company.  


So, since December 31, 2021 and until June 30, 2022 RMTI has   
\- increased their total assets by 21.7%  
\- decreased their current liabilities by 11.5%  
\- and decreased their total liabilities by 15.4%  
This is **GOOD**. As I said, this shows that the company is decreasing some of its risks &amp; is building up its wealth in assets.

&amp;#x200B;

from a technical analysis point of view, I personally really like this price below 1.71 for a buy, with a target at 1.85 &amp; then a revisit of 2.10! With a float of under 10M, this thing really could pop!  


Okay, that's going to cover it for me. Thanks in advance for reading this short DD! just to reiterate, I do not have a position in this company or anything like that.

t3_xb01i8|1662843943|smallstreetbets|The shift from underfeeding to overfeeding in 2022 = almost 3x bigger than the Cigar Lake uranium mine floods in 2006|"Hi everyone,

Someone on twitter (rana1965 on twitter) gave me the idea to compare both events more in detail (Justin Huhn probably talked about it with Uranium insider members, I'm not a member yet). Well, here it is:

**A. The shift from underfeeding to overfeeding in 2022 vs the Cigar Lake mine floods in 2006**

Nuclear fuel cycle:

\- phase1 mining

\- phase2: conversion from natural uranium to UF6

\- phase3: enrichment (where the shift from underfeeding to overfeeding is happening) to get EUP (Enriched uranium product)

\- phase4: nuclear fuel rods fabication with EUP

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ptt3nn8o33n91.png?width=1077&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8ba6492b614b7aa4feb2587229ac4dd750b1bde

https://preview.redd.it/9pny2ccq33n91.png?width=1089&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89ccd48245ea812b68549defee7b100b20e571e5

This additional global uranium deficit of \~50,000,000lb uranium is being created as we speak.

We are already seeing the first signs of this shift from underfeeding to overfeeding:

1. SWU (enrichment services) and conversion price went significantly higher the last couple of months (First Utilities secure enrichment services, than they secure conversion services. And after those 2 services have been secured utilities start to look for uranium!)
2. 2 weeks ago a post on twitter from John Quakes (but originaly from hchris999 on twitter) with parts of the 1H 2022 report of Urenco confirmed that the underfeeding is getting in full speed.

&amp;#x200B;

From Urenco enrichment company limited:

https://preview.redd.it/joaa4w4x33n91.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa7a7af2edb2bcefe70361dad933bebfe04101db

**In only 6 months time they already got more orders (11,300) than the entire years 2021 (8,700), 2020 (9,000), 2019 (10,600), ...**

This confirms the rush on the scarce enrichment services (SWU) and that **overfeeding is happening** soon, if not already.

While the global primary uranium supply in 2022 is around 135,000,000lb  --&gt; 50/135 = that additional annual supply deficit is 37% of the global uranium production in 2022! **And there already was a supply deficit before those \~50Mlbs/y!**

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion the impact of the shift from underfeeding to overfeeding will lead to:

\-  an additional supply gap of \~30 million ponds in 2022 (\~20 million lbs from underfeeding gone + \~10 million lbs (start of overfeeding))

\-  an additional supply gap of \~50 million pounds in 2023 (\~20 million lbs from underfeeding gone + \~30 million lbs (overfeeding in full speed))

&amp;#x200B;

[source: John Quakes on twitter](https://preview.redd.it/6uks6614c3n91.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edb88bd9f67158fd58490feb873ea73048d6f711)

**But the 20 million pounds of secondary supply (in yellow) from underfeeding aren't there anymore (Cameco in May 2022)!**

&amp;#x200B;

Before the shift from underfeeding to overfeeding, TradeTech predicted a 200 million lbs uranium demand compared to only 135 million lbs uranium production in 2022 + 20 million secondary supply from underfeeding, which already led to an annual global uranium deficit of \~45 million lb  in 2022

**Adding the additional annual deficit of \~30 Mlbs from the shift to this \~45  Mlbs deficit results in a total global supply deficit of \~75 million lbs  in 2022**

&amp;#x200B;

Based on my estimates the global uranium production in 2023 could increase by 20 million pounds (If everything goes according to all the production  plans. But in reality it never goes smoothly ;-), so it will probably  less than 20 million pounds). But ok, let's pretend a 20 million pounds  increase of global uranium production in 2023, meaning a production of \~155 million pounds in 2023.

200 million lbs uranium demand compared to only 135 + 20 million lbs uranium production in 2023 + 20 million secondary supply from underfeeding that will not exist in 2023, which would have led to an annual global uranium deficit of \~25 million lb in 2023

**Adding the additional annual deficit of \~50 Mlbs from the shift to this \~25 Mlbs deficit again results in a total global supply deficit of \~75  million lbs in 2023**

**Important to note here is that the estimated global production increase of 20 million lb in 2023 is only possible if the uranium price goes significantly higher than the \~52 USD/lb today. US miners and miners abroad will not start production to sell uranium at a loss. Period!**

&amp;#x200B;

For more information on this shift from underfeeding to overfeeding:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWpNToGmwKM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWpNToGmwKM) (June 30, 2022: Interview of the company responsible for buying uranium in the spotmarket for Sprott Physical Uranium Trust)

&amp;#x200B;

**Important to keep in mind is that you can‚Äôt overfeed with UF6 in 2022/2023 coming from uranium with a delivery date in 2024 that will be mined in 2024! Utilities and enrichers need additional uranium for DELIVERY IN THE  SHORT TERM (2022/2023)!** =&gt; Uranium spotprice is going much higher =&gt; **$U.UN $SRUUF $YCA $URNM $URA are going significantly higher in the coming months and 2023/2024 (imo)**

&amp;#x200B;

**Why do they need uranium for SHORT TERM DELIVERY?**

Because when they have to overfeed they have to use more uranium (UF6) to produce a same amount of EUP (Enriched Uranium Product). But they can't overfeed in 2H2022/2023 with contracted future uranium supply that will only be mined in 2024! They need additional uranium to be able to overfeed in 2H2022/2023!! Uranium deliveries in 2024/2025 will be too late for overfeeding in 2H2022/2023.

**We are talking about an 15% (or more) increase of UF6 needs to produce the same amount of EUP**

For instance (simplified example)

before the shift: 100 UF6 to produce 10 EUP

after the shift: 100 UF6 + 15 UF6 to produce 10 EUP

When utilities have an hypothetical operational reserve of 500 UF6:

\- before the shift they could produce 50 EUP with it

\- after the shift they only can produce 43 EUP with it

\- or **they buy an additional uranium for short term delivery to produce an additional 75 UF6** in the short term to add to their 500 UF6 reserve so that they are able to produce 50 EUP in the short term.

&amp;#x200B;

==&gt; So an add ANNUAL uranium supply gap of 50,000,000 lb uranium due to shift from underfeeding to overfeeding added to the already existing  global supply deficit before that shift, but don‚Äôt worry  (hahaha :-)) , in 2023 Energy Fuels (UUUU) could produce \~120,000lb, UR-Energy (URG) \~800,000lb, Encore Energy (EU) \~1,200,000lb, Uranium Energy Corp (UEC) 200,000lb (licensed for 6.5Mlb/y), Paladin Energy (PDN, PALAF) 3,200,000lb (ramp up phase), Boss Energy (BOE) 225,000lb (my own estimates based on the analysis of each existing uranium projects and uranium mines in USA and abroad, and backed by simulations of others)

**In other words, there will not be enough additional uranium production ready ON TIME in 2023/2024 to close that supply gap!**

&amp;#x200B;

So where are utilities and enrichers going to get the additional uranium from to be able to overfeed without decreasing their already low operational reserves?

1. a bit from production restarts (UUUU, URG, EU, UEC, PDN, ...) if the uranium price reached a much higher price than today
2. from above ground uranium stockpiles. But which one exactly?

Japan? NO, Japan wants to restart an additional 7 reactors by July/August 2023 and Cameco, one of the bigger uranium producers, went to Japan to talk with japanese utilities for new future uranium supply.

China? NO, they are increasing their strategic U3O8 stockpiles for energy security reasons

India? NO

Enrichers? NO, they are buyers of UF6 now!

Carrytrader? Haha, the remaining carrytrades, if any, will be difficult to honor with U3O8 from the spotmarket

=&gt; Uranium stockpiles of Denison Mines (2,500,000lb), Energy Fuels  (\~700,000lb), UR-Energy (\~325,000lb), Uranium Energy Corp (\~2,000,000lb, they bought 5 Mlbs, but \~3Mlb still has to be delivered (mined) in  2023/2025), Boss Energy (1,250,000lb), Encore Energy (\~200,000lb) will be very valuable in the coming months and in 2023! But they wil not sell  those pounds around 60 USD/lb. They want (selling uranium at 60 USD/lb  is from the past, 80 USD/lb is the new 60) and need (to finance CAPEX) much higher uranium prices for those pounds.

3) last resort is temporarly decreasing the already low operational uranium reserves even lower, but than they will have to restock even more 12 months later

&amp;#x200B;

**B. Can Kazakhstan (Kazatomprom and their JV partners in Kazakhstan) solve the problem?**

The answer: NO

It took Kazatomprom and their JV partners 20 years to go from 0.795 tU in 1997 to 24,586 tU in 2016!

[source: Kazatomprom](https://preview.redd.it/lmpf6ufk53n91.png?width=1792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2b2ed74b91b023f0d407030be37aecb78735986)

Adding an additional 50Mlbs/y (= an additional \~19,200 tU) in 2023/2025 to the \~22,000 tU production in 2022?

Forget that, it‚Äôs not possible.

Even today Kazatomprom has difficulties to reach their production goals due to supply problems (material needed for the ISR mining)

&amp;#x200B;

**C. In the meantime China aims to increase their strategic reserve.**

&amp;#x200B;

[source: Kazatomprom](https://preview.redd.it/gd4mzgcp53n91.png?width=1306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51703088a57680b95a967e2ad31e7fd317421049)

The first trip abroad (September 14, 2022) of China's Xi will be to Kazakhstan.

China:

\- knows that there is a uranium supply problem

\- has 150 additional reactor cores to fulfill and

\-  an own strategic reserve for their own energy security to build out.  Even more today, because China has practically no domestic uranium  production while the western world showed with the conflict in Ukraine  that in case of a conflict (Taiwan?) their supply would be in jeopardy.

&amp;#x200B;

ALL the uranium that [$EU](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24EU&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$URG](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24URG&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$UUUU](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24UUUU&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$PDN](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24PDN&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$BOE](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24BOE&amp;src=cashtag_click) [$UEC](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24UEC&amp;src=cashtag_click) ... could produced in 2023 will be sold in no time

&amp;#x200B;

**Help Paladin Energy ( $PDN $PALAF) and Global Atomic (** [**$GLO**](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24GLO&amp;src=cashtag_click) [**$GLATF**](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24GLATF&amp;src=cashtag_click)**), help! Your future uranium lbs are seriously needed!**

&amp;#x200B;

Important here also is:

1. the fact that the demand for uranium is price INelastic. An uranium price of 50 USD/lb or an uranium price of 100 USD/lb will NOT change the demand for uranium.
2. recessions don't reduce uranium consumption.

Oil demand could be impacted (probably will be) due to a world recession  (I'm not talking about the supply side of Oil), but uranium demand NOT.

Reactors don‚Äôt consume less uranium in a recession. Nuclear reactors consume the same amount during recessions, because nuclear power is baseload power!

&amp;#x200B;

**By consequence the uranium price will most probably increase significantly in the coming months and in 2023/2024.**

Today the uranium spotprice is at \~52USD/lb, while US miners need a sell price well above 60USD/lb and Cameco said in May: ‚Äùto restart our US  assets we need at least 80USD/lb‚Äù

Note: High season (September/October till February/March) in the uranium sector is about to start.

All commodities are cyclical! Uranium was in a bear market for 10 years since 2011 (Fukushima) which led to underinvestments in the sector resulting in a structural global deficit.

[source: John Quakes on twitter](https://preview.redd.it/3i7qhwqkb3n91.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6354c0eb89d1fbf35c32d009a33256a75c600f2a)

But now an additional annual \~50 million pound deficit was added to the already existing structural global deficit.

BlessedCBD #1 in UK, just announced delivery to Germany, USA, Italy, &amp; France. European takeover imminent!

NuLeaf &amp; FabCBD are both top CBD brands in the USA with 70%+ margins

Meanwhile, [GrassCity.com](https://GrassCity.com), [SmokeCartel.com](https://SmokeCartel.com), [DailyHighClub.com](https://DailyHighClub.com), &amp; [DankStop.com](https://DankStop.com) are most of the top accessory websites in the world getting. $HITI has 3M High Lifetime Value customers (who bought pipes, bongs, vapes, dab rigs, etc) in a list segmented by US state, so the have the option of setting up a high profit / low overhead partnership with a (NY for example) MSO to add a ""Buy Weed"" button in any state.

Q2 2022 ER Recap

[https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-reports-second-quarter-2022-financial-results-featuring-a-98-increase-in-revenue-and-ninth-straight-quarter-of-positive-adjusted-ebitda/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-reports-second-quarter-2022-financial-results-featuring-a-98-increase-in-revenue-and-ninth-straight-quarter-of-positive-adjusted-ebitda/)

1. DISCOUNT CLUB MODEL IS WORKING. Same Store Sales (SSS) growth is up 48% since they made the switch in October(!) -- all while small shops are struggling to compete, and F&amp;F is seeing SSS contraction. Raj also said the SSS growth is continuing in Q3 so far May &amp; June so the word is getting out. The plan was always to take a small hit in Retail margins, balanced by the CBD &amp; Accessory biz, so the competition (big &amp; small) were forced to close or sell to HITI. Burn the forest and only the big trees survive.
2. CLEAR LEADER IN RETAIL Revenue: HITI 81MM vs F&amp;F 41MM

EBITDA: HITI +2.4MM vs F&amp;F -2.4MM

Gross Profits: HITI +23% vs F&amp;F -26%

Cash Flow from Ops before working capital: +1.6MM vs F&amp;F -3.4MM

3) CASH &amp; NDF UPDATE. Cash as of 4/30 was 15M so that is enough before the 30M NDF closes ""in July"" which will be used to pay off debt at \~5% AND M&amp;A -- which you know Raj &amp; team has lined up.

2021 Recap

[https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-recaps-milestones-of-2021/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-recaps-milestones-of-2021/)

Q4 / 2021 ER (1/27/22) [https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-announces-unaudited-2021-financial-results-featuring-a-118-increase-in-revenue-and-record-adjusted-ebitda-of-12-4-million/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-announces-unaudited-2021-financial-results-featuring-a-118-increase-in-revenue-and-record-adjusted-ebitda-of-12-4-million/)

Nasdaq uplisting. 4 new analysts

Opened 48 stores. 150+ by EOY '22. 200 by EOY '23

Accretive M&amp;A of 3 Accessory biz &amp; 3 CBD biz

Club membership is booming w/ new discount model causing same store sales growth  $280M (CAD) run rate  $80M (CAD) run rate (internationally, mostly USA)

Rolling out Fastendr kiosk tech to all stores in 2022 AND M&amp;A -- which you know Raj &amp; team has lined up.

OVERVIEW

1. FINANCIALS.

A) \~$90M (USD) market cap when the price is $1.40/share (USD).

B) Q2 ER $81+M (CAD) revenue BEAT expectations. [https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-reports-second-quarter-2022-financial-results-featuring-a-98-increase-in-revenue-and-ninth-straight-quarter-of-positive-adjusted-ebitda/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-reports-second-quarter-2022-financial-results-featuring-a-98-increase-in-revenue-and-ninth-straight-quarter-of-positive-adjusted-ebitda/)

C) After Q2 ER the revenue run rate was updated to $325M+ (CAD) in 2022 with a higher goal possible based on the pace of M&amp;A and USA partnerships.

D) Rapid expansion of stores (105 EOY '21; 150+ EOY '22; 200 EOY '23) and M&amp;A now = Big Net Profits later

2) NON-DILUTIVE FINANCING (NDF) -- Management indicated on the Q2 ER call that a $30M NDF will be closed in July/August [https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-executes-letter-of-intent-for-30-million-non-dilutive-credit-facilities-with-connectfirst-credit-union/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-executes-letter-of-intent-for-30-million-non-dilutive-credit-facilities-with-connectfirst-credit-union/)

3) ANALYSTS w/ BUY RATINGS. It's not just about the 5 ""BUY"" ratings and the PTs -- these analysts host ""roadshows"" (giving them access to Raj, the team, and the facilities) and distribute their in-depth reports to all their institutional clients.

4) M&amp;A targets are always in a loaded deal pipeline. Negotiated several accretive deals on CBD &amp; Accessory businesses to round out their diverse THC, CBD, &amp; Accessory cannabis biz ecosystem:

5) ETFs (MJ, YOLO, THCX, BUDX, MJXL) hold &amp; add. MJ ETF has accumulated millions of shares over several months, so they own \~8% of the float.

6) INSTITUTIONS went from 0 to \~30 institutions in just a few quarters. Institutional ownership went up 420% from Q2 to Q3, and another 106% from Q3 to Q4 -- with far more Calls than Puts. New institutions quietly buying in Q2 was revealed mid-May.

INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP %: [https://stocktwits.com/MungyboyStocks/message/461856619](https://stocktwits.com/MungyboyStocks/message/461856619)

CALLS/PUTS: [https://stocktwits.com/MungyboyStocks/message/461858005](https://stocktwits.com/MungyboyStocks/message/461858005)

NOTE: Institutions have a much easier time owning HITI vs an OTC listed MSO because they are listed on the Nasdaq with no grow operation -- which allows them to get past their compliance department. \*

7) VALUATION. Undervalued. \~.5 P/S which is extremely low compared to other retailers like Dollarama, MSOS, and especially LPs. NASDAQ-listed Canadian LPs are unprofitable cash-burning machines, powered by dilution &amp; delusion. MSOS can't as much institutional love stuck on the OTC.

RAJ IS A SELF-MADE (BEAST) CEO

Raj is the biggest shareholder (\~6.5M!) and has never sold a share.

He started this company with $40k and one store and grew it into the empire you see today. And he isn't slowing down.

He wasn't handed millions which he squandered paying themselves and their friends first or expanding too much too fast.

He is shrewd. Smart. Strategic. Charismatic. Transparent. And he does whatever he says he is going to do, when he says he is going to do it.  That's rare.

You bet on visionary leaders like that.

That's why there are 4-5x as many watchers on StockTwits than any USA MSO.

The passion we feel is contagious. It's only a matter of time before more institutions and retail investors realize what we already did and trust Raj to take us to the promised land.

NULEAF NATURALS ACQUISITION SIGNIFICANCE

[https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-continues-expansion-into-global-cbd-market-with-acquisition-of-colorado-based-nuleaf-naturals/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-continues-expansion-into-global-cbd-market-with-acquisition-of-colorado-based-nuleaf-naturals/)

Located in Denver CO, NuLeaf Naturals is one of the top CBD brands in the USA in terms of CBD-blend research &amp; IP, rapid growth, and industry-leading margins. $16M of the \~$20M revenue is direct-to-consumer, but the expanding agreement with Sprouts will allow for wider B&amp;M retail distribution.

It's notable that their facility is cGMP certified. It can generate up to 60,000 vegan soft-gels per hour, which is 25% of their business. Production, co-packing, &amp; shipping of FabCBD was moved to the facility for cost savings through operational efficiencies.

Once USA legalization allows, High Tide hinted that this facility could also create THC infused edibles and drinks.

DISCOUNT CLUB MODEL STRATEGY

[https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-becomes-north-americas-first-cannabis-discount-club-retailer-with-over-245000-members/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-becomes-north-americas-first-cannabis-discount-club-retailer-with-over-245000-members/) (as of the 7/28 PR, it's now 670K+ members)

DATA DRIVEN decision based on successful pilot programs

Membership in this loyalty program is FREE ...for now. Every person who walks into a Canna Cabana sees a high cost for non-members, and a discounted cost for members. When they realize signing up for FREE with their email address and phone # (SMS) makes them a MEMBER of the CABANA CLUB, they will do so in order to save money on that purchase and future purchases.

Stores are stocked w/ HIGH MARGIN products like consumption accessories, FabCBD &amp; Blessed CBD, (VERY soon) house brands of shatter &amp; gummies &amp; prerolls -- with other form factors later.

Same store sales are way up Q over Q while the other retailers are seeing declines.

\*\*This is a DATA and MARKET SHARE / CUSTOMER LOYALTY grab from other retailers and the black market by running them out of business. When the time is right, High Tide has indicated they will monetize this membership -- most likely with Free, Premium, &amp; VIP type paid memberships for max discounts &amp; benefits

EXAMPLE: Let's say High Tide decides to monetize their membership when they have 1M members. 1/4th of those members (250K) sign up for the $5/mo / $60/year plan. That's $15MM in profit that goes straight to the bottom line.\*\*

FASTENDR

[https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-to-acquire-fastendr-retail-kiosk-and-smart-locker-technology-through-acquisition-of-bud-room-inc/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-to-acquire-fastendr-retail-kiosk-and-smart-locker-technology-through-acquisition-of-bud-room-inc/)

Watch Video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oTvTrTSnn4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oTvTrTSnn4)

Discount model is causing long lines out the door. Taking a page from leading retailers in other sectors, this allows customers to order online or at a kiosk, and pick up from a ""smart"" locker. For those customers who know what they want and don't need the budtender's guidance, this is a slick convenience. Very few dispensaries in the world have this experience.

Also mentioned in the PR is the desire to license this tech to other dispensaries and industries which could turn into yet another revenue stream.

Delivery will be made available in as many location as allowed by law, but this offers a fast, convenient, slick way of ordering / picking up. It also cuts down on $$$ spent on budtenders while keeping lines moving.

With plans to expand in Europe, I could envision a smaller ""Bud Room"" store concept that almost feels like a vending machine. While not discussed in the press release, the stigma of cannabis still exists worldwide, so some might be turned off by the idea of being seen in line waiting at a dispensary. Side benefit worth mentioning.

Overall, while this will increase profitability, this changes the perception of the company stock to THC + CBD + Accessories + Data&amp;Tech -- which should help command higher multiples.

CATALYSTS Barnacles like to see develop

A) NON-DILUTIVE FINANCING. Allows rapid expansion without just issuing shares. Should close in July/August. [https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-executes-letter-of-intent-for-30-million-non-dilutive-credit-facilities-with-connectfirst-credit-union/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-executes-letter-of-intent-for-30-million-non-dilutive-credit-facilities-with-connectfirst-credit-union/)

B) NEW DISCOUNT CLUB MODEL + PRIVATE LABEL LAUNCH. 2.0 products (launching soon!) &amp; CBD will mega-boost margins.

C) FUNDAMENTALS improving through rapid store opening&amp;maturation and M&amp;A aligned w/ eCommerce domination STRATEGY. 3M+ high lifetime value customer emails + data + social across USA = most valuable asset

D) LEGALIZATION ""working-on-it"" headlines sparking another forward-looking cannabis sector bull run. Most institutions can't invest in USA MSOs stuck on the OTC (likely several more mo), so they invest in NASDAQ companies w/ higher valuations. And we all know HITI's superior fundamentals, valuation, &amp; profit projections stack up very well vs LPs &amp; comps

E) MORE ANALYSTS &amp; INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS

F) NARRATIVE shift from LP to RETAIL. See: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSdyhx11iJM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSdyhx11iJM)

G) USA STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP. Online &amp; B&amp;M. Read: [https://mjbizdaily.com/how-canadian-cannabis-retailer-high-tide-plans-to-enter-united-states/](https://mjbizdaily.com/how-canadian-cannabis-retailer-high-tide-plans-to-enter-united-states/)

""RETAIL SATURATION / COMPETITION"" CONCERNS(?)

People worried about ""saturation"" don't get that big boys like High Tide are the ones that will benefit in the long run. Mom &amp; Pops will get run out of business due to margin pressure. Meanwhile High Tide uses their position to negotiate better prices, which only serves to accelerate this process. Then High Tide gets to buy the best locations based on data while letting the underperformers close their doors.

Coffee shops close. Starbucks gets bigger/stronger.

Department stores close. Target gets bigger/stronger.

Taking pages from the playbooks of Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and Grocery Stores is how HITI will win in this Retail game.

Burn the forest and only the big tree survive &amp; thrive. High Tide is engaging in a price war it knows it can win because of its diverse streams of revenue.

GROWTH &gt; STAGNATION

The entire cannabis sector is in rapid growth mode. Top operators do all they can to expand their geographic footprint. They use cash, loans, and shares to buy &amp; build assets that allow them to sell cannabis in as many locations as possible.

(High Tide's strategy is unique because they have been more focused on expanding their DIGITAL footprint, but I've covered the brilliance of that strategy in other posts.)

The reason they are all expanding this quickly is because they are confident the demand will continue we to rise and those assets will be worth far more in the future. Frankly, if they don't expand into X state, their competition will.

What if High Tide never bought META or any of these profitable eCommerce CBD &amp; Accessory biz. High Tide would be net profitable with 30ish locations, and Raj could still own 51% of the shares.

No ""dilution"" (yay!?), BUT...

No Growth. No World Domination. No Nasdaq. No institutions. No '20-'21 stock price boom.

GROWTH is better than Stagnation

COMMANDING ECOMM RETAILER MULTIPLES

High margin private label THC (edibles, shatter -- later flower, vape, etc) &amp; [FabCBD.com](https://FabCBD.com) / BlessedCBD / NuLeaf a big reason High Tide is projected to be net profitable later in 2022.

When High Tide...

A) Sells the most Accessories &amp; CBD worldwide.

B) Owns multiple businesses in the USA.

C) Sells cannabis data.

D) Produces/creates THC edible, vape, &amp; flower brands.

E) Provides accessories to dispensaries across multiple states.

F) PARTNERS WITH STATE OPERATORS TO GIVE THEM ACCESS TO SELL THC TO THEIR 3M+ HIGH LIFETIME VALUE CANNABIS CONSUMERS(!!)

...is it still considered ""just a Canadian Cannabis Retailer"" ???

Well, I'm glad you asked..."|"Hey all, I‚Äôm back, and I just wanted to talk about a company that I recently came across, EverGen **($EVGN)**. Now, I am not a science expert by any means and as such, it took me an embarrassingly long time to break down this business model and what they do....but I suffered so you do not have to.¬† 

&amp;#x200B;

**What do they do?** 

EverGen (TSXV: EVGN | OTCQB: EVGIF) acquires, develops, owns, and operates Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) projects using a platform approach to reliably build sustainable infrastructure to supply the NA gas grid w/clean energy from organic waste. Essentially, they are taking organic waste, running it through something called an Anaerobic Digester and it produces Digestate (become fertilizer, soil, livestock bedding) OR Biogas (our focus today). With the Biogas, it is put through an upgrading process to produce RNG, which is then plugged into the gas grid via fixed long-term contracts with the likes of FortisBC, Enbridge, Union Gas, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What does their operation look like currently?** 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\- 4¬†owned + operated RNG and/or organic processing facilities   
&gt;  
&gt;\- 11 target development projects (near term)   
&gt;  
&gt;\- $16B potential revenue from FortisBC program 

&amp;#x200B;

**Ok, but explain the business model again...** 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\- Securing long-term contracts w/respect to its feedstock inputs (long-term municipal contracts) + RNG outputs (FortisBC offtake)   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Proven Anaerobic Digester tech which is commonly used in the European mkt   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Executing on a developmental model through a network of strategic partnerships and committed stakeholders   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Utilizing existing natural gas infrastructure (no transition needed for customers)‚Ä¶Proven delivery pipelines 

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial Highlights** 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\- Term sheet w/Roynat &amp; EDC for Senior Term Loan Facility | **$31M**   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Q2 2022 | Strong cash position of **$17.4M to support future growth**   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Y/E as at Dec. 31, 2021 (in CDN 000s) | **Revenue: $9,564**   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Pre-funded CapEx for material EBITDA growth | **$45M** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Notable Industry Info**¬† 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\- Canadian Gas Association Targets | **5% RNG by 2025 &amp; 10% by 2030** (result in 14.0MT emission reductions per year by 2030)   
&gt;  
&gt;\- RNG consumption is expected to increase from **42 PJ in 2018 to 377 PJ in 2040** (CAGR of \~10%)   
&gt;  
&gt;\- North American gas utilities targeting 5**-15% of renewables by volume compared to less than 1% today**   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Global Investment in renewable energy first half of 2022 | **USD $226B (up 11% YoY)** 

&amp;#x200B;

In essence, I am not trying to tell you to start pouring corn oil down our gas tank, I am no social warrior, but I do like seeing and responding to robust investment opportunities like this one. Also, I am always happy to see EDC or BDC (any government affiliated financial entity) providing financing. These finance robust projects they truly feel will be successful and have sound fundamentals. As I often say, some forces seem to be inevitable and this is how I see RNG. It is something that governments have said they will be moving to, gas associations also stating a move to RNG. It all tells the same story."|0.73|5|0|5

**Two**. After talking about the update in insurance he has once again mentioned banks and financial institutions.I suspect one of those is one of the ‚Äútrophy‚Äù deals he is working on and that will cause the stock to absolutely rocket.

**Three**. Love how he says that the pipeline is full but no need to be selective who they take on anymore because it‚Äôs ‚Äúall about automation‚Äù and they can now load up someone same day. Why turn anyone away when you can be taking their money within the day and the automation keeps churning it in.

**Four**. The burn rate has been reduced by OVER 50%. WOW!!

**Five**.We appear to be largely complete in terms of defining the company. This includes real time digital wallet AI tech that is used in venue management, coupons, loyalty programs and anything that uses a digital pass (pretty much everything). Leveraging all of this will be the sale of the data that they all produce. So with this the focus has shifted away from developing their tech and stacks to selling it

**Six**. They continue to overcome customer resistance by managing the programs for them. This is KEY. Many customers don‚Äôt have a tech department to handle the integration of their tech. No problem. We‚Äôll do it all for you at a ridiculous margin.

**Seven**. Their partners are bearing fruit. Telus, Janam, Barnett, Yotpo are kicking ass.

**Eight**. Big pilots underway for 8112 with the launch in September/October. This is gonna be absolutely YUGE for Fobi not just in the delivery, but by introducing other verticals with it and then throwing in their real time data analytics and of course the selling of that data.

**Nine**. With the burn rate seriously reduced and the obvious pick up in revs, we are getting closer to profitability or at the very least cash flow positive. We can debate until we are blue in the face how big Fobi is going to become. To be totally frank with you I have no idea. Everything screams HUGE company but one truly never knows. But this I do know. Fobi IS going to be very successful. I back this up based on two principles. Their tech is fully automated. In essence it is like software. Download it and it's done. BUT it's software that keeps on giving...download it, pay a set up fee, pay a user fee, and down the road, pay us for your data. It has margins like software but the added benefit of the data which makes it obscene. Secondly, their technology is at the forefront of where the world it going...digitization. So you don't have to worry about Fobi getting passed by as the industry changes. Wallet passes and digitization will be with us for decades. There are no concerns that next year Fobi will become obsolete like those companies dealing with the pandemic. The turning point is upon us and the road is clear for ... well... a very long timeI am very bullish on this company and on its technology that knows no limits, it can be adopted in every vertical and sector with ease and speed. I trust that in a few years the name Fobi will be very well known. Do your dd guys and you'll discover a rough diamond mine in Fobi!

McDonalds, burger King and many other brands could use Qples by fobi coupons to increase customer loyalty, Roi and better Given the high inflation that has led to the reduction in consumer purchasing power, CPGs are looking for new ways to attract customers. I think the arrival of digital coupons and the transition to 8112 has been accelerated by this. Fobi is able to increase customer loyalty by issuing digital coupons through Qples! This would be very useful for big brands to increase, not only the ROi, but the possibility of attracting customers based on promotions aimed at them! I think it is revolutionary! Fobi operates in different sectors and verticals, I find it a fantastic company. As a data first company, it is very disruptive and at the forefront of what it does. Qples by FOBI, ‚Äã‚Äãprovide physical / digital coupons in minutes and they are at the forefront of what they provide, a one-time, fast and efficient solution. the switch to 8112 is imminent and high inflation is only accelerating it!"|0.88|29|0|29

I don't see where to post this given it's too small market cap for WSB ($224 million market cap) and too high of share price for r/pennystocks (\~$14), but I'm writing about **Build a Bear Workshop,** which has the ticker symbol $BBW. 

They just reported earnings, and it seems like the market isn't excited that they missed on EPS but the stock isn't down massively either.

Reasons to like the stock:

1. The ticker symbol is $BBW. I hope I don't have to explain why this is bullish / funny.
2. They're actually **profitable** and have a P/E ratio is **\~4.5,** which is low.
3. They just authorized a buyback for **$50 million by 2026**, which is 1/4th of the current market cap.
4. Debt / Equity ratio is .91, which is healthy given its industry.
5. Company is actually growing in relevance with meaningful partnerships and expansions. They've partnered with Nintendo recently and announced they're getting into pet toys too.
6. I remind you: the ticker is **$BBW.** Do I really need to say more?

Reasons to dislike the stock:

1. It's easy to think their recent growth is a ""fad"" and unsustainable in the long term. Whether or not it is or isn't is hard to say, but only time will tell.
2. Not a lot of insider buying at this price. Not really bullish or bearish, but I'd like to see some.
3. Seems like they have a decent amount of activists who want the company to sell themselves to a PE firm or use their cash in a more meaningful ways than buybacks.

Anyhow, thanks for reading. Don't really know if to mark this as DD or shitposting because it's a combination of both, but best of luck to everyone.

Good day everyone,

BioSig Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: BSGM) is a medical technology company operating in the fast-growing electrophysiology sector is certainly one of them.

Current price¬† $1.05/share (at 1:30 p.m. EDT 9-1-22)

Their flagship product, PURE EP‚Ñ¢ System is an advanced computerized system for acquiring, digitizing, amplifying, filtering, measuring, and calculating, displaying, recording, and storing electrocardiographic and intracardiac signals for patients undergoing electrophysiology (EP) procedures. The most common application for the PURE EP System is surgical intervention to treat atrial fibrillation (AFIB), which is a type of arrhythmia, or abnormal heartbeat.

On Tuesday of this week BSGM released a significand press release that may act as a near term catalyst for the company‚Äôs value and we wanted to advise you of it. With the NASDAQ in retreat this week the impact of this near certain catalyst hasn‚Äôt gained much traction, but once the NASDAQ turns green, I expect there could be a significant bounce in the BSGM value.

BSGM just announced that it has expanded its marketing and sales teams to scale and support the national commercial rollout of its PURE EP‚Ñ¢ System, doubling the size of its sales organization, with plans of tripling it before the fourth quarter of this year.

There have been eleven Regulation 4 filings since August 17th by insiders buying up shares in anticipation of company sales ramping up quickly. The total purchases added up to 158,776 shares, bought at the market and many bought at prices above today‚Äôs price! Why are these insiders buying up company shares? Because they know significantly increasing revenues are just around the bend.

I will have more on BSGM soon,

Lucky

30 dollars! The stock is 36.50 after the drop.

The company has authorized 30% of profits for 2023 to go back to diamond hands in the form of dividends. They are set to make 3-4 billion in profit for 2023!

Profit!

They are set to make over 6 billion for 2022! 

Yes, the company is now trading at 4.4 billion total.

The will make over 6 billion in 2022 and 3+ billion 2023!

They have 120 million shares, so if they gave out 30 dollars as above dividends that is nearly 3.6 billion!

In other words the company is trading at below what they make!

The company has close to 6 billion in cash! It has a little over 2 billion in debt! 

They had sales growth of 45% in 2nd quarter of 2022 and made 1.34 billion! With a B! profit! 

It has come down with other vessel shippers because dry balk shipping rates have come down to 2020 levels.. However they are making over 6 billion in 2022, paid 3.6 billion to diamond hodlers‚Ä¶ Will make 3-4 billion in 2023 and authorized 30% of profits in the form of dividends! 

$15 dollars roughly!

So if we are going to diamond hand something, might as well collect tendies while we wait!

Good luck ‚Äúregards‚Äù"|0.43|0|0|0

Geol., have resigned as directors of the Company, in order to welcome the appointments of two new independent directors to the board of directors (the ""Board""), Keith Peck and Peter Gundy, in their place. Sean Mager will continue to act as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company.

Keith Peck is Chair and CEO of Lincoln Peck Financial Inc., a financial advisory firm focused on the resources sector, and a Chartered Business Valuator with over 35 years of investment banking experience, including as vice-president and director of RBC Dominion Securities Inc., Haywood Securities Inc. and vice-chair of Yorkton Securities Inc. Mr. Peck has significant public company experience, including acting as the chair of Camino Minerals Corporation. Mr. Peck was a founder of Centenario Copper Corporation which was acquired by Quadra Mining Ltd. in 2009. Mr. Peck was more recently chair of Orezone Gold Corporation and was a director and audit committee chair of Bluestone Resources Inc.

Peter Gundy was a co-founder of Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (a predecessor to Nutrien) and the founder of Neo Material Technologies Inc (""NEM""), serving as NEM's chief executive officer and chair from 1992 to 2008. NEM became a global leader in the production of advanced rare earth metals also used in the electronics industries and automotive sectors. In 2012, NEM was sold to Molycorp for $1.1 billion. Mr. Gundy has served as a director with numerous publicly traded companies, and currently serves on the board of Andean Precious Metals, where he is chair of both its audit committee and nomination and corporate governance committee.

In addition to changes in the composition of the Board, the Company has appointed Keith Peck as the independent Lead Director of the Board. John Williamson will remain as executive Chairman and CEO. As Lead Director, Mr. Peck will provide leadership to the Board and the independent directors and facilitate the functioning of the Board independently of management, working together with the executive Chairman. The Company has also reconstituted its Audit Committee to be comprised solely of independent directors, within the meaning of National Instrument 52-110 - *Audit Committees*. Effective immediately, the members of the Audit Committee are Mr. Peck, Mr. Gundy and Mr. Toby Pierce. Mr. Gundy has been appointed Chair of the Audit Committee. In accordance with best governance practices, the reconstituted Board has also resolved to form an independent Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee (""GNC Committee""), comprised of Mr. Peck, Mr. Gundy and Mr. Pierce. The new GNC Committee will assist the Board with respect to governance, nominating and compensation matters relating to the Company.

John Williamson, Chairman and CEO, said: ""We are very pleased to welcome Keith and Peter to Benchmark's Board. As seasoned veterans with proven track records in the resources sector, and deep expertise in public company governance, strategy, capital markets and strong financial and business acumen, we are confident these changes and governance enhancements will complement the existing Board structures and help strengthen Benchmark's performance and long-term value for the benefit of all of the Company's shareholders and key stakeholders. On behalf of the Board, I'd also like to thank Michael and Sean for their past Board service."""|0.94|16|0|16

Now, these companies are not competitors, in fact I can realistically see CATL using KULR to further improve their product. CATL grew 3400% from 2016 to 2020, they have partnered with: BMW, Honda, Volkswagen, Volvo, Tesla, and more. They have, since the time of the source I am using, 26% of the market share in EV battery making (tied with LG Energy).   


Now, I know that KULR doesn't make EV batteries, but both CATL and KULR are undervalued companies in my eyes. Me, personally, I am going to be looking to pick up some shares of CATL company once they IPO. AND with KULR's CAGR being over 20% since its inception (outpacing the lithium-ion battery market CAGR of 8.2%), I will likely be eyeing the charts to find a great spot to pick some shares in the future. 

KULR and CATL are both pointing to outperformance and severe undervaluance, in my humble opinion.

Many of you have heard about e-sports but I was never aware of how large and profitable the industry was (honestly, outside of FortNite my video game knowledge is ZERO). Investcanada states that viewership has increased 8% YOY and that audience size is expected to hit 577million by 2024. They also state that the US and Canadian gaming market are expected to hit 2.8 billion in revenue by 2023. 

ESE Entertainment plans to capitalize on the growing e-sports industry by providing a wide range of services to video game dev teams and to publishers. These services primarily revolve around providing tech infrastructure and fan engagement services. (Think gaming leagues and the tech infrastructure to stream them properly).

But don't listen to some stranger on Reddit...listen to the rich stranger in a sit instead, this interview from Konrad Wasiela (CEO of ESE) on how they monetize e-sports to generate revenue. Starts at¬†1:35:

Forward Thinking Time,

* A report from Grand View Research predicted that the retail market for rare cannabinoids will reach upwards of $26B by 2028. So it seems InMed is striving to become an established and reliable supply of these rare cannabinoids for commercial scales.

&amp;#x200B;

* According to an analysis price target on [wallstreetzen.com](https://wallstreetzen.com), conducted by HC Wainwright &amp; Co. The 12 month price target for InMed Pharmaceuticals Inc. is forecasted to be $6.00 USD. A, 494.06% increase.

&amp;#x200B;

Summary,

* With InMed being a leader in rare cannabinoids, InMed plans to unlock the therapeutic potential of the medical benefits. With two pharmaceutical programs already initiated, they are preparing to initiate a clinical study in glaucoma following the promising preclinical results. Might be worth keeping an eye on in the near future.

This really comes in handy if you work and can not watch your stocks all day.
The group started on reddit some time ago and has grown and moved to discord recently. It is $20 a month subscription but mods are talking about how to give back to the members through various ways. The group is also full of after hour laughs and there are many discussion channels to talk about stocks and other subjects. The laughs and enjoyment from the chats alone are worth the $20 a month not including all the extra money you will make if you follow their advice. They are talking about increasing the price soon so I would advise to get in while it is still only $20. You can always choose to just not resubscribe next month if you don't like it.

t3_wt0tji|1660979209|smallstreetbets|Why 90 DELTA Options ITM with 30 days are money makers, and why OTM Options (weekly or even longer) are not!|Hi, I am actually an Investment Banking ex-Pro (for some Swiss Banks in Zurich) who is retired.I am the guy who posted the Paul Pelosi style QQQ Gain and was asked why I didn‚Äôt choose an OTM option with ‚Äúless risk‚Äù. I am so glad our friend asked, so I can actually write you guys why I post here. Because only a few people will read my comment, I decided to post it as a whole as separate post. I plan to do a series of posting Gains and Losses of QQQ positions here as educational series on correct Option trades as Pro as trading examples - if people care. My standard account is about 500.000$, but in order to do an educational I trade positions for 2500$ per Option, always 90 Delta &amp; 30 days time. I had a Daily short signal (I will post a screenshot of my signals the next time also) and exited because of the weekend. I will reposition the put on Monday, but not the same, because this one is now 97 Delta. Again 90 Delta. The reason you and most other beginners loose money is because you think of OTM as safe. The opposite is the case. Less Capital at risk for an OTM is not safe, because the market will rarely move large enough percentage wise for an OTM to be profitable more than 50% of the time. This is why you loose half the time all your money of your paid OTM option premium, but when you gain you need a lot of time for a move to gain Delta so your OTM becomes at least ATM! The market may not give you your ATM strike level quickly, so when the market has reached your strike price, you have lost so much time premium already that you need to be even further ITM to break even and start to be profitable. You avoid all this by being profitable immediately with a 90 Delta option that has a minimum of 30 days time. This is why I trade this way, every pro including Paul Pelosi trades this way because we know the theory behind it. The key is to adapt the MARKET to your account, but NOT the strike price!!! I have a 500.000$ account, so if QQQ moves 500-1200$ dollar per Option against me in a trading day it is 0.3% daily risk maximum for my account. Conversely, if you want to do the same but only have a 30.000$ account, you must choose an option that is about maximum 900$ value total (3% of your account value max) and has a minimum 85 delta, 27-30 days time (as close as you can get). It should be a very liquid large cap stock or index ETF. I suggest TQQQ for beginners. Current example for Monday: if you believe TQQQ goes down, you buy the 43 Put 16 Sep @8 (=800$). Conversely, if you believe the TQQQ goes up, you buy the 28 Call 16 Sep at @8.10 (=810$). I hope this makes your trading better as it should be. Stop trading OTM, trade like a pro ITM. If people express interest by commenting, I will continue to post. If the people here are not interested, nevermind, I will not post anything further.

Yeah, me too.

You know who sells them?

Bed Bath and Beyond.

You know who else sells that and more?

You guessed it. Kohl's.

So when Bed Bath and Beyond goes bankrupt (that means out of business for your mouth breathers), Kohl's will get some of Bed Bath and Beyond's store traffic.

And when store traffic increases, that means revenue increases. And when revenue increases that means more profit.

So while you're watching the BBBY dumpster fire, remember that one store's loss is another store's gain.

And Kohl's will gain some and that means the share price will do fine for the time being until some other company tries to eat it up.

Until then. Eat a donut."|0.43|0|0|0

Or, as I like to call it, the MoABH.

You're sitting on your BBBY stock all night; tossing and turning in bed.

Dreaming that maybe one day you'll be able to make a mortgage payment and super size that Big Mac combo.

So you hatch a plan. Not a great one. But it's a plan.

You'll post to WSB about how Ryan Cohen isn't the reason why the stock mooned. 

About how if all of the apes just held strong the stock would fly again like a pigeon in the sky.

You tell everyone that if we don't sell and buy some more the MOASS will arrive and fortune is guaranteed.

But I see through all of your BS.

It is plain as day. 

You want to drop bags.

You want to drop your bags on SOMEONE ELSE.

All you have to do is convince a herd of apes to wait and just buy enough to pump the price up so you can sell all of your shares.

And they'd be none the wiser because you're some anonymous regard on the internet hiding behind some random screen name and sorry user flair.

So when you read all of these posts about how Ryan Cohen wasn't the catalyst and how ape strong can save BBBY, remember what is really happening.

Someone is trying to stop you from selling so that they can sell.

Someone is trying to convince you to buy more ""cheap"" shares so that they can drop their bags on you at a slightly smaller loss.

You see, rent is due in a week and that stimulus check is gone. 

Nobody has f-u money like papa Musk and daddy Cohen.

All you have now are these shares of BBBY that won't even be worth beans by Christmas.

So buyer beware and sellers get ready.

Because at the open it'll be a rush for the exits. If the stock holds over $5 today, that would be nice.

But that's still a ton of bag holding for someone who could have sold their shares for twice that pre-market.

Sorry for your losses. 

It'll be even more sorry if you lost more."|0.35|0|0|0

The market for these franchises are huge and may include subscription video on demand providers (like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc.)

Good day everyone,

Grom Social Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: GROM) the social media company just for kids, and a creator of media content for animated films and televisions series.

Current price **$.485/share (+ 6%** at market close 8-17-22)

GROM shares recorded their second day of strong gains in the Wednesday session with a 6% advance. Trading volume was 448K shares.

GROM is currently trading less than half its book value and has closed the past five sessions above it SMA20 and SMA50 averages indicating a trend and a potential swing toward the SMA200 of $1.27/share.

I anticipate revenues may grow for GROM in H2 2022 and I want to take a specific look at developments at all the company‚Äôs segments for growth initiatives.

**Grom Social** ‚Äì has generated marginal revenues from subscriptions and advertising thus far. The total digital ad spend on kids has grown from $600M in 2016 to over $1.68B in 2021. A kids website safety watchdog group, welivesecurity.com rates **Grom Social as one of the top four best websites for children**. GROM is currently reworking the Grom Social website with an updated release scheduled for Q4 2022.

**Top Draw Animation** ‚Äì currently the top revenue generator for the company. In addition to the $1.4M in contracts awarded to them in June, they‚Äôve just landed a $1.3M contract to begin later in Q3 2022. The addition of Russell Hicks and Jared Wolfson to the TDA C-Suite gives Top Draw access to new Hollywood animation business.

**Grom Educational Services** ‚Äì already a revenue generator for the company that offers NetSpective Web filtering solutions, which helps safeguard students K-12 from harmful content and inappropriate sites when on campus or when using school-issued devices or Wi-Fi. The segment also offers a newly updated Digital Citizen Licensing (DCL) course for students that schools rely on to stay in compliance with the CIPA act which ties e-rate funding to schools and districts that demonstrate their students have been taught the importance of digital safety.

**Curiosity Ink Media (CIM)** ‚Äì not a current revenue generator but has the greatest potential. Subscription video on demand providers like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc. are scrambling for new subscribers and they have largely missed out on the Preschooler and animation opportunity. CIM has at least eight multimedia content franchises currently in development by a team of creative people with big name hits in their resumes like SpongeBob SquarePants, Dora the Explorer, and Scooby Doo that can be marketed and collaboratively developed by any of those subscription video companies looking for subscribers and wanting to address a market segment they‚Äôve missed.

Santa.com could be a significant revenue producer fir CIM in H2 2022 as its ecommerce storefront begins operating this holiday season. The company has licensing rights to sell the Cats vs Pickles plush toys this season as well as many other holiday gifts and needs. CIM has enlisted marketing professionals including All Court Interactive to drive traffic to the site.

CIM has collaborated with Dynamite Entertainment, a publisher of books and comics, to start exposure to their Thunderous and The Legion of Forgettable Supervillains IP franchises and these books are currently on store shelves. Dynamite will also publish holiday books that CIM has in the works. Books and comics are often the incubators for a hit franchise.

**It only takes one or two hit franchises to create the fortunes of a creative content company given the long list of downstream revenues from a hit.** Can GROM produce a hit franchise? I‚Äôm not going to list the resumes of the GROM team here, you can see that on the company website, but the **team has a lot of experience at several children‚Äôs media content companies like Disney and Cartoon Network. Noticeably, the team has several members with extensive tenure at Nickelodeon.**

News Out Today: Grom Social (GROM) **Announces a Major Contract for Its Top Draw Animation Segment**

Top Draw gets accolades for being a top-tier animation studio.

Good day everyone,

Grom Social Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: GROM) is the social media company just for kids, and a creator of media content for animated films and televisions series.

Current price **$.485/share (+ 6%** as of 9:57 a.m. EST 8-17-22)

After closing the Tuesday session at $457/share, with a gain of 7.4%, GROM shares are continuing to gain in early trading today.

In [news just released today](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grom-social-top-draw-animation-120000525.html)

, GROM announced that Top Draw Animation (TDA) has been awarded an additional $1.3M in animation assignments. Production on the new assignments is anticipated to commence in late Q3-2022.

**Russell Hicks, President of TDA said, ‚ÄúWhen animation veterans like Ant Ward, director of the Netflix film ‚ÄòRise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,‚Äô acknowledge the importance of TDA‚Äôs role in delivering the story they wish to tell, then we know that we‚Äôre at the top of our game.‚Äù**

original report below

Grom Social (GROM) Has Turned a Corner and is Starting to Generate Higher Revenues that Will Ramp Through 2023

Potential technical bounce toward the 200 DMA at $1.31/share.

Good day everyone,

Grom Social Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: GROM) the social media company just for kids, and a creator of media content for animated films and televisions series.

**Current price $.45/share (at market close 8-16-22)**

Initiating coverage of GROM and a look at the current operations of the company. I feel that GROM is a tremendous value currently and will generate potential gains near-term.

Darren Marks, CEO [issued a letter to stakeholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grom-social-enterprises-chief-executive-120000428.html)

on July 27th with an update on GROM operations and a view toward the company‚Äôs potential. I urge you all to read it.

**If you are new to our group, GROM operates four distinct segments:**

**Grom Social** is a web destination for children under 13 and one of the top children‚Äôs websites. The company is rolling out an upgraded version with a new look in Q4 this year.

**Grom Educational Services** offers NetSpective Web filtering solutions, which helps safeguard students K-12 from harmful content and inappropriate sites. This segment could generate $1M in 2022 revenues.

**Top Draw Animation** has a studio in the Philippines with over 400 artists creating animation content to programmers. This segment has recently begun an effort to provide their services in the Hollywood market. Annual revenues at Top Draw Could be $6-8M in 2022.

**Curiosity Ink Media (CIM),** a company GROM bought 80% of one year ago, remains the best bet to transform the company into a generator of significant revenues and net income. CIM has spent the past year building their team and developing their IP portfolio of creative content for children.

The creative projects CIM is developing sound exciting, and they are being developed by world-class talent with a proven resume of success. Titles such as Laugh on Lorb, Heston of the Apes, Mr. Zip, Thunderous, and The Legion of Forgettable Supervillains are being developed into multi-platform franchises. The market for these franchises is huge and may include subscription video on demand providers (like **Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc.**), many of which are realizing the opportunity that original content for preschoolers and animation represents.

CIM may likely record its initial revenues in Q-4 this year with their santa.com website. It's a virtual North Pole with an e-commerce shop where consumers can shop for all their holiday needs. This year the site will feature products from the popular Cats-vs-Pickles franchise.

**Recent developments at GROM:**

The Legion of Forgettable Supervillains, a CIM creative franchise, made its debut as a graphic novel in comic bookstores on Wednesday, July 27, prior to its wider release wherever books are sold, that began Tuesday, August 9th. The first in a series of planned releases, The Legion of Forgettable Supervillains centers around a group of failed superheroes who inadvertently find greater success and acclaim in villainy.

Thunderous, another CIM franchise with a recently released graphic novel, will take center stage at the 2022 Montana Book Festival taking place in Missoula, September 15-18. Thunderous is a graphic novel about a modern Native American teenager‚Äôs journey to understand and appreciate her family‚Äôs rich heritage, and first appeared on bookshelves in late April.

Both graphic novels mentioned above have reached the consumer market through GROM‚Äôs collaboration with publisher Dynamite Entertainment. Dynamite is a top tier company that primarily publishes adaptations of franchises from other media including top authors with big name creative franchises.

Stock Price: $0.7600

Market Cap: $12.588M

52-week Range: $0.4500 - $3.1500

Avg. Volume: 206,975

(As of August 17, 2022)

**Introduction**

I recently came across AppTech Payments, a FinTech company utilizing innovative digital banking technology to complement core merchant services. They instantly stood out to me as they have an impressive list of intellectual property with the patents to back it up. Exclusivity is a big deal in the FinTech space, and having these patents could be a significant driver of value for the company.

The company makes omni-channel payments possible, as shown below:

**Highlights**

* Q1 2022 saw a 3% increase in revenue compared to Q1 2021, which was driven by increased residual payouts
* Cash balance is $10.3 million after the IPO early this year, indicating good financial health
* Acquisition of Hothand Inc. closed, providing more FinTech patents
* AppTech is listed on Nasdaq as of January 2022
* Steady gross profit growth in past 3 years

**Conclusion**

With payments and transactions becoming increasingly digitized, a company like AppTech Payments with a number of technology patents could be a long-term player in the space. The company has a strong team with plenty of experience, and I‚Äôm excited to see this company expand and gain even more traction in the FinTech space.

&amp;#x200B;

Summary,

* With InMed being a leader in rare cannabinoids, InMed plans to unlock the therapeutic potential of the medical benefits. With two pharmaceutical programs already initiated, they are preparing to initiate a clinical study in glaucoma following the promising preclinical results. Might be worth keeping an eye on in the near future.

(TSXV: CPAU) (OTCQB: COPAF) is pleased to announce the results of its recently completed four hole, 1,428 metre diamond drill campaign at its Williams Copper-Gold Project located in the Toodoggone region of north-central British Columbia.

Drilling targeting untested soil geochemical anomalies at the GIC porphyry target has resulted in the discovery of a new gold zone yielding 2.2 grams-per-tonne (g/t) gold (Au) and 0.13% copper (Cu) over 50 metres; including 4.2 g/t Au over 10.5 metres within drill hole WM22-02. Both the copper and gold mineralization appear to be improving at depth with the drill hole ending in strong mineralization, demonstrating the significant potential to expand on this initial discovery.

The new gold discovery lies at the west end the of the GIC porphyry target, a 4 km x 0.8 km east-west trending copper-gold(¬±molybdenum) geochemical and IP/resistivity geophysical anomaly that has been subject to only limited historical drilling.

Jeremy Yaseniuk, CEO, commented, ""*We are extremely excited with this new gold-copper discovery. Given that this new discovery has only been tested by a single drill hole and ended in some of the strongest mineralization, additional drill testing is warranted at depth and along strike to define this emerging mineralized zone.""*"|0.88|15|0|15

Good Day Everyone,

**EMCORE Corporation (NASDAQ: EMKR)** builds advanced optical semiconductors and systems that reside at the heart of today‚Äôs leading-edge aerospace &amp; defense platforms and highspeed communication networks.

Current price $2.88 (as of market close 8-12-22)

Last week was tumultuous for EMKR and its stakeholders. Last Tuesday the company shares were trading at $3.27. On Wednesday they released Q322 earnings, missing analysts‚Äô expectations and announced the $55M cash acquisition of the Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG) and Inertial Navigation Systems business segment of KVH Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: KVHI).

The market responded to the revenue miss with a knee jerk reaction, driving the price to $2.45/share on Wednesday. After investors had a couple days of absorbing the news, the company‚Äôs shares moved to $2.88 by Friday. I wanted to report to you on EMKR because **I believe the stock may fill the gap created last week. Take a look at the chart (below) I see a potential gap fill at over $5.00/share.**

EMKR missed their Q3 (FYE is September 30) guidance of $25-27M in revenues, reporting $23M. I believe that EMKR, given the high-tech components used in their products, was particularly impacted by supply chain issues. Here is what the company had to say:

‚ÄúDuring the three months ended June 30, 2022, unexpected delays and cancellations of key component deliveries required us to source critical components from alternative sources on short schedules and at increased prices, and a COVID-19 outbreak at the Company's Concord facility resulted in production delays and since our last call, the Cable TV business has become more turbulent, with a major customer deciding to exit CATV entirely.‚Äù

I‚Äôm looking at the bigger picture to guide me on EMKR. In FYE 2018 the company had $85M in revenues and built that up to $158M in FYE 2021 and this year the company has made some acquisitions. I believe the **market has not given the company the benefit of the value in its accretive acquisitions** and has placed too much focus on the narrow Q3 revenue miss.

**It‚Äôs my belief that two recent accretive acquisitions, one at the end of April and one last week could add $50M to the company‚Äôs annual top line.**

**Accretive acquisitions:**

EMKR just acquired the Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG) and Inertial Navigation Systems business segment of KVH Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: KVHI) for $55M in cash. EMKR reported $74.6M in cash at the end of Q3 on June30th. EMCORE acquired all the intellectual property and outstanding assets and liabilities of KVH‚Äôs FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems business segment, including the 100,384-square-foot production facility located in Tinley Park, Illinois. This new business from KVHI is generating over $30.0 million in revenue on an annual basis.

On April 29, 2022, EMKR completed the accretive acquisition of the L3Harris Technologies, Inc. Space and Navigation business for approximately $5.0 million. The acquisition brought Supplier agreement with L3Harris Space &amp; Sensors for the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas and Centaur launch vehicle, and existing products used for guidance on the international space station and classified reconnaissance platforms. In Q3, ended June 30sth EMKR reported $3.5M in partial quarter (2 month) revenues for the L3Harris segment. That could translate into annual revenues of $20M.

EKMR has an extensive product line and serves several industries with a blue-chip list of customers. As a part of your due diligence, I urge you to visit the company website at [emcore.com](https://mailchi.mp/broadstreetalerts/emcore.com)

, as well as looking at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugsI-RjxoZk)

giving an overview of EMKR products and markets. Make no mistake, as you can see in the links, EMKR makes crucial components for the world‚Äôs most advanced aerospace, defense and communication systems.

**EMKR operates with two segments:**

**Aerospace and Defense** with two product lines: (1) Navigation and Inertial Sensing, and (2) Defense Optoelectronics. The company reports ‚ÄúDemand in our A&amp;D business segment is strong, and we expect our QMEMS operational issues to improve with a rebound in the September quarter.‚Äù

**Broadband** with three product lines: (1) CATV Lasers and Transmitters, (2) Chip Devices, and (3) Other Optical Products. The company reports ‚ÄúWe began low volume shipments of data center chips as projected, signaling a new growth phase in Broadband.‚Äù

The addition of the new KVHI facility brings the number of production facilities operated by EMKR to four.

EMKR sees their Total Addressable Market at $2.7B and frankly, for much of their business, there isn't a lot of competition. I believe that is why EMKR has seen consistent growth (FYE 2022 may be an exception) and may see much higher revenues after this year‚Äôs accretive acquisitions.

**EMKR statistics:**

FYE September 30th, MRQ June 30,2022  
Outstanding shares¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 37.5M  
Shares in float¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 30M  
Cash (mrq)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† $74.6M  
Book value (mrq)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† $3.56/share  
Institutional ownership 69%

I note that in afterhours trading in last Friday‚Äôs session EMKR shares were at $2.95. I expect the short-term gap may fill quickly creating a momentum swing that could surpass the SMA 200 of $4.70/share.

EMCORE Corporation (taken from form 10-Q)  
EMKR is a leading provider of sensors for navigation in the aerospace and defense market as well as a manufacturer of lasers and optical subsystems for use in the broadband industry. We pioneered the linear fiber optic transmission technology that enabled the world‚Äôs first delivery of Cable TV directly on fiber, and today are a leading provider of advanced products that enable communications systems and service providers to meet growing demand for increased bandwidth and connectivity. The technology at the heart of our broadband communications products is shared with our fiber optic gyroscope (‚ÄúFOG‚Äù) and inertial sensors to provide the aerospace and defense markets with state-of-the-art navigation systems technology. With the acquisitions of (a) Systron Donner Inertial, Inc. (‚ÄúSDI‚Äù), a navigation systems provider with a scalable, chip-based platform for higher volume gyro applications utilizing quartz micro-electromechanical system (‚ÄúQMEMS‚Äù) technology, in June 2019, and (b) the L3Harris Space and Navigation (‚ÄúS&amp;N‚Äù) business in April 2022, we further expanded our portfolio of gyros and inertial sensors with SDI‚Äôs QMEMS gyro and accelerometer technology and S&amp;N's FOG and ring laser gyro (‚ÄúRLG‚Äù) technology. We have fully vertically integrated manufacturing capability through our indium phosphide (‚ÄúInP‚Äù) compound semiconductor wafer fabrication facility at our headquarters in Alhambra, CA and through our QMEMS processing and sensor manufacturing facility in Concord, CA, and our FOG and RLG manufacturing facility in Budd Lake, NJ. These facilities support our vertically integrated manufacturing strategy for QMEMS, FOG, and RLG products for navigation systems, and, with respect to our Alhambra, CA facility, for our chip, laser, transmitter, and receiver products for broadband applications. With both analog and digital circuits on multiple chips, or even a single chip, the value of Mixed-Signal device solutions is often substantially greater than traditional digital applications and requires a specialized expertise held by us which is unique in the optics industry.

More on EMKR coming soon,

Lucky

(TSXV: APN) (WKN: A2JNFG) is pleased to announce a new discovery at the Maria Luisa Project (the ""Project""), located 100 km north of La Serena within the Atacama region in Incahuasi, Chile. Drill hole 22MLDDH012 intersected 10.50 metres (m) of 3.76 grams per tonne (g/t) gold (Au) and 3.83% copper (Cu), including 3.00 m of 2.30 g/t Au and 8.26% Cu, and 4.50 m of 6.03 g/t Au and 2.19% Cu; results are in Table 1. This drill hole was collared at the 867 m level of the current underground workings at Maria Luisa.

Program Highlights

* Drill hole 22MLDDH012 is a new discovery north and west of historical underground workings. The area has never been historically drilled or mined, follow-up work is underway to delineate the scope and scale of this new discovery.
* Rocks hosting high copper and high gold grades in 22MLDDH012 vary with depth (Table 1).  

   * 1.00 m of 0.88 g/t Au and 2.36% Cu is from copper and iron oxide that is spatially associated with a fault gouge zone.
   * 10.50 m of 3.76 g/t Au and 3.83% Cu is associated with a silicified breccia zone characterized by blebby to massive copper sulphide (chalcopyrite) and disseminated pyrite.
   * At depth, 0.50 m of chalcopyrite-bearing intrusive returned 6.46% Cu.
* Assay results are pending for four drill holes that intersected intervals similar in appearance to the high-grade breccia zone of 22MLDDH012.
* The Company has developed 410 metres of the NW-SE trending Maria Luisa Decline and is now approximately 23 metres from the projected initial target length. Cross cuts to the SW will intersect the vein system to support the proposed mining plan.
* The decline advance also allows the Company to continue testing exploration targets from underground drilling (Figure 3).  


 Alastair McIntyre, President and CEO, commented, ""We are very encouraged with the discovery of this new zone and the corresponding high-grade gold and copper assay results. The recent work at Maria Luisa has focused on developing our underground decline system while establishing strategic underground drill locations. This provides the opportunity to drill new targets efficiently to support exploration and potential mine development with the added advantage of expanding our understanding of the multi-vein system at Maria Luisa*.""*"|0.95|27|0|27

So...as businesses grow quickly and consumers continue to increase their dependence on technology, companies need to make sure that they have access to the data needed in order to make informed business decisions. Thanks to modern analytics and data lakes, smart companies can now gain a competitive advantage leveraging their data across various departments and driving a more efficient business model.

**Now, my hopefully intrigued friend, what is a data lake?**

*A data lake is a digital repository for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. It allows you to store the data in one place, where nobody knows what's in it or who put it there. Your team can extract any data, at any time, without having to request it from another division.*

This saves many hours daily that would be spent collating and formatting this information with no chance of errors coming from different systems sharing bad data. The cost savings come from simply having access to the raw data when needed rather than waiting for it to be requested and processed; thus saving manpower hours as well as not needing to purchase specialized software or hardware such as ETL tools or cloud services to perform these tasks.

**Wow MurkyDinner...why would I, a savvy investor, care?**

As you may know, part of ESE's growth strategy includes developing and deploying its proprietary DataLake/BI infrastructure to deal with big data ingestion and subsequent processing of said data. The ability to pull in large amounts of useable data will prove to be lucrative as it is commonly believed that data is the number one product for e-sports adjacent companies. Think about it, marketers, developers, and everyone in between want as much data on current and potential gamers as possible to target the right people in the right places. If you, like $ESE | $ENTEF, can build a large repository of useable data, you are well poised for success."|0.84|4|0|4

We are in a demand zone on the daily right now and SPY seems to want to stick very close to 411 price. Could be some consolidation for multiple days before we start to see the real move for the future so for now, I will be just playing some short scalps until we break out of this demand area.

Tomorrow Pelosi is set to land in Taiwan and set to speak to lawmakers on Wednesday amid rising tensions between US and China and Taiwan. If Pelosi doesn‚Äôt decide to go to Taiwan or backs out expect market to jump on news. If she does go expect higher volatility with uncertainty of what China will do as they have already said they would shoot down the plane.

My main concern with China and Taiwan is most of our semiconductors are based in Taiwan. TSM is one of the biggest chip manufacturers and they are strictly based there. If problems arise the states wouldn‚Äôt be able to or it would be very hard to get the chips strictly for the tech giants such as AAPL, TSLA, F, and many others.

Today the Atlanta Fed came out with their updated GDPNow Q3 estimate. It has now dropped since July 29th from 2.1% originally to now updated 1.3%. This is not good news for the future forecast as it has already dropped 0.8% and at this rate, we will be negative in a month.

These are the levels I will be watching for tomorrow 8/2:

&amp;#x200B;

SPY:

BULLISH: Above 411 ‚Äì 413.36 (triple topped hod)

BEARISH: Below 411 ‚Äì 408.41 (lod)

Support: 408.41, 407.18, 400

Resistance: 413.36, 416.69

&amp;#x200B;

I still expect us to consolidate as long as we are in this demand zone and until we breakout either way we will continue to consolidate. Everybody have a great rest of your day and I will see everyone tomorrow morning in PM!

My question is: when else would I want to do a credit spread? I've scanned a bunch of stocks looking for opportunities, but the returns are so low compared to the risk and the fact the leg difference is held up until I close out.  
  
Just looking for thoughts on OTM credit spreads vs close to the money debit spreads, and other uses for them besides earnings IV crush. In both cases seems like I'm making the same play on a movement, except with the debit spread I'm able to make a lot more money without tying up a bunch of funds."|1.0|1|0|1

Been a lot of red until this past month. Now we are about to get into August with ‚Äúgood‚Äù news ahead. As next week we are due for a pullback to retest some levels, but very bullish short term. 

Until we have some more bad news about inflation or good news for economy expect the market to try and run more on hopes of the Fed will have to be more dovish turn at the next FOMC statement. The fact that the Fed isn‚Äôt anticipating anything for the future can be good for bulls for short term as they are not trying to forecast anything, but PCE data this morning was good news for inflation. 

Powell stated the other day that they looked at PCE data, especially Core PCE data than CPI or GDP. With the labor market ‚Äústrong‚Äù as he stated, if Core PCE continues to either peak in June or continue to go down this will be good news and this morning that‚Äôs just what we got. Core PCE came in at 4.8%, 4.7% expected and YoY PCE came in at 6.8%, consensus was 6.7%. This was just barely above expectations and market ran with it hoping inflation peaked in June as gas prices continue to come down. 

Pelosi is set to head to Asia going into this next week with unconfirmed trip to Taiwan that could spark even more problems between U.S. and China. If Pelosi decides to go to Taiwan, her plane will be escorted by Fighter Jets in case of China intercepting or shooting down. Unclear if she will decide to go, but definitely need to keep an eye on tensions between U.S. and China as this will most definitely affect the market. 

As far as technicals today we hit resistance at 411 and got rejected went for the retest and broke out. It was a beautiful inverse H&amp;S set up on the 3 min that I called out. Got the breakout and made some money along the way. With the daily we are in a bear flag longer term, so I expect we get a small pullback this next week to retest some levels as not as much data comes out.

RIO DE JANEIRO, July 28 (Reuters) - Brazil's Petrobras smashed second quarter profit and margin estimates, boosted by divestments and higher margins in its natural gas business, the company said on Thursday.

In a securities filing, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the state-run oil firm is formally known, reported a net income of 54.33 billion reais ($10.5 billion), well above the Refinitiv consensus estimate of 38 billion reais.

Big day ahead of us and we started off this fine morning with another negative quarter GDP rating at -0.9% which is the definition of a recession. Powell stated yesterday in the press conference that he did not believe we were in a recession even if GDP was negative, but that the Fed looks more at PCE data instead. 

This morning PCE data was 7.1% YoY same as previous. I have included a pic down below that shows the possible run up this morning as investors still believe CPI YoY peaked on a YoY basis in June. Based on today‚Äôs data, financial indicators point to the same conclusion ‚Äì BLOOMBERG. 

With all of this being said, the EU consumer confidence this morning crashed to a new record low as German CPI unexpectedly re-accelerated. Keep a close eye on this as it can affect our market as well. 

Breaking news this morning as well the U.S. House Dems to propose a ban on stock trading for Congressional members and their family members in August. 

I shall watch as the market tries to digest all of this news coming out all at once and reassess this afternoon in AH on which way we are headed, but for now it seems like up is the way. This afternoon in AH we have two Big Tech earnings for AAPL and AMZN. WMT was hit hard which is a retailer just like Amazon earlier this week with cutting forecasts and Amazon tanked in AH. I will be curious to see if Amazon has had any problems with supply chains issues or products. 

These are the levels I will be watching for today:

Shout out to u/ VegetableResource204 for original DD notes, which I've updated and modified below:

\-Dave reported Q1 earnings in March with boosted revenue guidance and a huge membership jump.

\-The stock ran from $4 to $10 in March and it has been downhill since March 21st. After debuting at a $4bn marketcap, it has fallen to a measly $312mm

\-A 50% retracement to it's highs would be a 6-7x from here ($5.00 - $6.00).

\-FTX has $100mm invested in Dave LAST quarter 2022  
\-Also backed by Mark Cuban since IPO. This is a potential buyout target by a larger FinTech player (UpStart? Block? PayPal? Affirm?). Eventually the company will have to be saved from this drastic overexaggerated drop.

\-There was no material news for this significant drop since March 21st (even with the market downturn, it should not be down 90%)

\-**Dave has 6.5 MILLION members, SOFI (5.66b market cap as of 7/26) has only 3.5 million**. According to the CEO himself: ""Those numbers completed an average of 4.4 transactions per month during the quarter. Our non-GAAP total operating revenue for the quarter was $43.7 billion representing growth of 24% year-over-year. As a reminder, Q1 is historically our latest quarter due to tax refund season, reducing the need for credit amongst our target consumer. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 was negative $18.3 million as we continue to invest in growth and product development.""

Huge revenue stream down the line once market mulls over inflation.

Stock appears to have bottomed out at this range (52 week low is $0.54). 10/10 risk/reward IMO.

**DAVE has &gt;$300mm in CASH. Long term debt at $135mm. Current market cap is $312mm. It's trading marginally above net cash levels.**

**The play: Enter now and wait for August earnings report (huge catalyst, potential news), take profits above $5.00-$6.00, ride the wave up to $10+ which is where it peaked on March 21st after positive Q1 earnings release**

A strong product line and acceptance by major cell networks are driving the company forward.  
 

Good day everyone,  
 

**Siyata Mobile Inc. (NASDAQ: SYTA)** is a B2B global vendor of next generation Push-To-Talk over Cellular (PoC) devices and cellular booster systems.  
 

Current price $.84/share (as of 10:30 a.m. EDT 7-26-22)  
 

SYTA shares closed the Tuesday session at $.835/share, virtually the  same price as the Monday session with 263K shares traded. In early  trading Wednesday SYTA shares are looking for traction.  
 

The company‚Äôs future has never looked stronger, and they are reporting  potential catalysts on a regular basis right now. The big news in 2022  has been the channel/distribution partners **the company has reached agreements to carry the hot SD7 product on their networks with:**  
 

**AT&amp;T, FirstNet, Verizon, Logic Wireless, US Cellular, and Azetti, TASSTA (T-Mobile and others will likely come on board).**  
 

In [news just released this week](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/siyatas-mission-critical-push-talk-120000291.html),  the SD7 device is now available from TASSTA, a global MCPTT software  provider and end-to-end solution for critical communications. TASSTA has  been recognized as a ""Top 10 Emergency Management Solutions Providers""  by Government CIO Outlook for three consecutive years. They cited the  SD7's battery life and robustness as reasons for their choice. TASSTA,  based in Germany, targets industries including, army, emergency  services, transport, building and construction, healthcare, campus and  shopping centers, ports, public transport, security, government, and  taxi services.  
 

The company‚Äôs Q122 earnings report, indicated a drop in revenues from  Q121. We‚Äôve talked about SYTA‚Äôs decision last year to walk away from  most of its legacy products and go all-in on its new technologies like  the SD7 and VK7 (described below). It was a bold move, and the company  knew it could cost them revenues in the short term.  
 

But that move is paying off as SYTA announced a $2.2M order for the SD7  and related products after Q1 this year. The company has projected sales  of $10-35M in 2023 and they will no doubt be ramping up to that level  in 2022. The current price of SYTA shares looks like an irresistible  value should revenue projections come to fruition.  
 

SYTA is a small company. Those big-name partner companies I mentioned  above will also be selling STYA products. If a salesperson walks into an  urban police department and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Siyata Mobile and I want to  upgrade your two-way radio system,‚Äù they will likely hear ‚Äúwho is  Siyata Mobile?‚Äù However, if a salesperson says ‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôm from Verizon‚Äù  they have immediate credibility.  
 

The PTT over cellular market is dominated by big players like Motorola.  Is SYTA going to knock them out of the way? That would be nice but not  likely. The global push-to-talk over cellular market reached a value of  $4.2 Billion in 2021. Looking forward, IMARC Group expects the market to  reach $7.4 Billion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 10% during 2022-2027. **That means that every 1% of market share is going to be worth $74M in revenues.**  
 

Statista tells us that the U.S. smartphone market is $74B and is  dominated by Apple and Samsung (75%). Everyone I know uses one of those  brands. OnePlus has captured just 2% of the U.S. smartphone market and  that small percentage generates $1.4B in annual revenues. If SYTA only  captures 2% (I believe it could be much higher) of the PTT market they  could generate $150M in revenues.  
 

The SD7 is a game changer. It works just like a two-way radio. But those  old-style radios operate on a closed network with a limited range. The  SD7 is a cellular device that operates on networks such as Verizon and  AT&amp;T, so their range is virtually unlimited. There are millions of  two-way radios around the world waiting to be replaced.

The Siyata SD7 is a highly functional and rugged Android based PTT only  handset. The SD7 is the cornerstone of the new line-up of products for  SYTA. The device is IP68 compliant, protected against dust and debris  with drop protection. To me, it‚Äôs a rugged looking product and TASSTA  cited long battery life as a part of its SD7 choice.  
 

VK7 ‚Äì an in-car mounted solution that pairs with the SD7. Features an  integrated 20-watt speaker, a simple slide-in connection sleeve for the  SD7, and an external antenna connection for connecting to a windshield  or roof mount antenna.

**Uniden products from SYTA:**  
 

The Uniden¬Æ UV350 - In-vehicle smartphone designed to optimize mobile  communications. Designed specifically for commercial vehicles ensuring  safer communication for professional drivers.  
 

The Uniden¬Æ CP250 - tablet style device for voice calls, navigation,  data apps and built-in camera. This device was designed to be installed  on the dash or mounted on a windshield, specifically for lighter  commercial vehicles such taxis, vans, and delivery trucks.  
 

Uniden¬Æ UR5 ‚Äì another rugged handheld phone. This device is IP68  MIL810-G compliant and has 4G/LTE speed, clear cellular call quality.  
 

Uniden¬Æ UR7 ‚Äì a rugged smart phone in a clamshell form. It is based on a  Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset supporting all North American bands  including 4G LTE.  
 

(5) Models of Uniden cellular boosters for consumers and enterprise.  Uniden¬Æ Cellular Signal Booster kits are the most technologically  advanced signal solutions available today offering clear phone calls and  fast data speeds. They work with all cellular service providers 3G and  4G/LTE networks and are 5G ready.  
 

I‚Äôm providing a link to a video interview with SYTA CEO Marc Seelenfreund recorded July 15th and titled [Siyata Mobile: Disrupting the Land Mobile Radio Industry with Next Generation Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P-QcMXUj7k). It‚Äôs a useful source of information about the company.  
 

**Once again, SYTA statistics:**  
 FYE is 12-31 (Figures below as of the most recent quarter 3-31-22)  
 

Outstanding shares¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 15.1M

 Market cap¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† $12.6M  
 

As I said above, SYTA is at its lowest market cap of the year ($12.6M)  and the company‚Äôs future has never looked stronger. When I look at the  chart below, with an RSI (14) of only 30.74, I see the potential for a  double-, or triple-digit bounce screaming at me.

This has squeeze potential to top it off.

**$AUY**

Yamana is being acquired in an all-stock deal by Gold Fields, which has proven to be quite the controversy.  Despite all the noise, this merger will inevitably go through and will birth a behemoth of epic proportions ready to eat Barricks lunch.

About,

I was taking a look into some bio-pharmaceutical companies and came across Immix, and decided to do a little overview of them. Founded in 2012 by a group composed of a visionary physician/scientist, a world-renown pharmacology expert, a seasoned biotechnology patent attorney and an impact-driven founding family office. They focus on developing a new class of tissue specific therapeutics, with the end goal of replacing first-line therapies across a multitude of cancer indications.

&amp;#x200B;

Recent News:

Summary:

With Immix being in the Oncology market, as well as the Immuno-Dysregulated Diseases market they have placed themselves in a combined multi billion dollar marketplace. Seeing as they are valued around a combined $28B USD. Their continued development, as well as clinical and preclinical research is definitely something I'm interested in seeing play out over the next year or two. What are your thoughts on their clinical research?

The stock fell almost 50% after the company advised of a private placement of $10M of common shares at market price. While the sale may be dilutive SPRC still has a tiny share count, that may be only six million shares +/- outstanding (a current report is pending). The early June price, before the private placement, was $3.63/share.

**The cash raise has made the company stronger exactly when they need it most** as they move into more advanced clinical trials with their product line of canna-binoid based medicines. The stock price is being driven by two recently announced catalysts. Their SCI-110 drug is [moving into a Phase 2b clinical trial](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/scisparc-announces-ethics-committee-approval-133000636.html) for the treatment of Tourette Syndrome, and their SCI-210 drug has received an [approval to move into clinical trials](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/scisparc-announces-ethics-committee-approval-133000636.html) for autism spectrum disorder.

After the cash raise the company stated, ‚ÄúPotential strategic transactions to be explored and evaluated during the review process may include additional investments in innovative companies, acquisitions, a strategic partnership with one or more parties, or the licensing of one or more of the Company‚Äôs proprietary technologies or indications. If any such transaction results in equity consideration, **the Company may consider making dividend in kind distributions**, subject to applicable law and regulations, to its shareholders.‚Äù

The SPRC drug candidates are designed to treat Tourette Syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Epilepsy, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease and Agitation, and Pain. The company estimates their **total addressable market to be over $100B in the next few years**. As I discuss the SPRC pipeline and collaborations below, you may believe, as I do, that the company has enormous potential and could support a significantly higher market value.

**The SPRC Product Pipeline:**

**CannAmide‚Ñ¢** is an immediate unique palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) oral formulation for the reduction of chronic pain and inflammation. CannAmide is currently available in tablet form, with each dose containing 400mg active pharmaceutical ingredient. It has been designated a product license issuance from the Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate from Health Canada, for sale as a supplement within the nutraceuticals market and is Trademarked in the U.S. Both SPRC drugs SCI-110 and SCI-210 contain CannAmide.

**SCI-110** is a proprietary drug candidate, containing Dronabinol (FDA approved synthetic form of T-H-C), with the endocanna-binoid palmitoylethanolamide (PEA). The product is being developed under the accelerated regulatory path of 505 (b)(2) application. Indications currently being investigated for treatment with SCI-110 include Tourette Syndrome, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, and Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease and Agitation. The company has just announced it's prepared to begin a Phase IIb clinical trial for Tourette Syndrome.

**SCI-210** is a proprietary drug candidate containing canna-bidiol, a non-psychoactive canna-binoid, and PEA. Indications currently being investigated for treatment with SCI-210 include, autism spectrum disorder and Status Epilepticus, a form of seizures that are severe and sometimes fatal. SPRC has recently announced that it has received approval from the Ethics Committee of The Soroka University Medical Center to conduct the Company‚Äôs clinical trial for SCI-210 in patients suffering from autism spectrum disorder.

**SCI-160** is a proprietary synthetic CB2 receptor agonist created, among others, for the treatment of pain and is currently in pre-clinical studies. The CB2 receptor agonist used in this formulation ‚Äì HU-433 ‚Äì was invented and synthesized by Professor Raphael Mechoulam, Ph.D., Chairman of the SciSparc Scientific Advisory Board.

**SPRC Collaborative Agreements:**

MitoCareX Bio Ltd. is SciSparc‚Äôs recently established joint venture for the discovery and development of potential drugs for cancers, infectious diseases, and other life-threatening conditions.

The company and Clearmind Medicine have filed a provisional patent application related to treating cocaine addiction based on SciSparc‚Äôs CannAmide‚Ñ¢ compound and Clearmind‚Äôs MEAI. Initial positive pre-clinical results for treatment for cocaine addiction using MEAI, a novel psychedelic molecule of Clearmind indicated a potential synergistic effect between SciSparc‚Äôs CannAmide compound and Clearmind‚Äôs MEAI.

SPRC is collaborating with Polyrizon LTD. As part of the collaboration, the two companies will work to develop a unique technology for the treatment of pain, based on SciSparc's SCI-160 platform and Polyrizon‚Äôs Trap and TargetTM intranasal drug delivery technology to target the central nervous system.

SPRC has eight granted patents (5 in the U.S.) and patents pending in Europe, China, and Japan.

In the chart below we can see that SPRC is bouncing off a low of $1.80 that occurred on June 17th. Note the recent price levels of $3.63/share on June 9th, $3.95/share on May 24th, and $6.99/share on March 25th of this year.

**About SPRC:**

Repurposing previously approved compounds qualifies SciSparc to take advantage of the FDA‚Äôs 505 (b)(2) application protocol. This potentially means lower risk, and an expedited development timeline. The result is a robust pipeline of product candidates well positioned to create significant shareholder value into the future.

SciSparc has built an intellectual property portfolio which currently comprises five granted U.S. patents and pending patent applications in nine families, all focused on disorders of the central nervous system. Currently, their drug candidates are designed to treat Tourette Syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Epilepsy, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease and Agitation, and Pain.

Their research and development efforts are focused on creating a proprietary and unique combination of products, some available already in the market (CannAmide‚Ñ¢), products in the accelerated regulatory path of 505 (b)(2) application (SCI-110, SCI-210) and products that constitute a new chemical entity (SCI-160) in order to bring different products to market at different timelines and potentially enable them to generate immediate revenues for the company, augmenting FDA-approved natural and synthetic canna-binoids in combination with our proprietary compounds and technologies to create alternate therapies that potentiate the effects of canna-binoids and target the receptors implicated in modulating the central nervous system.

We will have a full report available on SciSparc Soon.

10:12 am ET June 29, 2022 (Dow Jones) PrintJosh Nathan-Kazis 

The White House said late Tuesday that it would sharply expand availability of monkeypox vaccines while rolling out more testing capacity for the virus, as the number of monkeypox cases globally continues to rise.

The U.S. will immediately distribute 56,000 doses of the monkeypox vaccine Jynneos, made by the firm Bavarian Nordic (BVNRY), currently held in the federal government's Strategic National Stockpile. The White House said that doses will be allocated to states based on the number of cases in each state, among other factors.

In addition to those doses, the U.S. expects to receive 300,000 more doses of Jynneos in the coming weeks, 240,000 of which will be made available and 60,000 of which will be held in reserve.

The U.S. The Department of Health and Human Services says it expects 750,000 additional doses to be made available over the summer, and 500,000 more in the fall.

The new announcement represents a substantial broadening in the U.S. vaccination strategy against monkeypox, which as of Tuesday had only seen 9,000 doses distributed.

The U.S. government will also allow states to order another vaccine, ACAM2000, approved to prevent smallpox but also used to prevent monkeypox. HHS said Tuesday that, while there are much greater available supplies of ACAM2000, its ""significant side effects"" mean it is not recommended for everyone. Shares of ACAM2000's manufacturer, Emergent Biosolutions (EBS), were flat in Wednesday morning trading."|0.8|9|0|9

(TSXV: APN) (WKN: A2JNFG) (""**Altiplano**"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to report that final processing approval has been received from the Chilean Mining authority SERNAGEOMIN (Servicio Nacional de Geolog√≠a y Miner√≠a). This final permit allows operations to begin at the Company's processing facility constructed at El Pe√±√≥n, approximately 15 kms from the Farellon Copper Gold mine located near La Serena, Chile.

Processing of stockpiled material currently stored at the El Pe√±√≥n site has begun as a part of the commissioning of the plant, with the first concentrate expected to be produced for shipment in July. Production from Farellon will be split shipped to the facility and ENAMI for the next few months to maximize copper sales while the plant ramps up to full operational capacity.

Operation of the plant provides the Company the opportunity to reduce trucking costs by 75% and processing costs by 45% while recovering additional payable metals. The El Pe√±√≥n crushing and flotation plant will incorporate a high efficiency water recovery circuit designed to produce dry tailings and an iron separator to recover high value iron oxide from the tailings output. This process will reduce the tailings output by 50% where dry tailings can be moved and stored in an environmentally efficient manner replacing the need for a conventional tailings dam system. In addition, the de-watering stack circuit will reduce the overall freshwater consumption needed at the plant by 75%. This eco-friendly system will be one of the first to be used in the small mining sector in Chile and elevates Altiplano to a leader in reducing its environmental footprint.

*President and CEO Alastair McIntyre commented: ""We are very pleased with El Pe√±√≥n receiving final permitting approval and commencing start up. This significant milestone was achieved through the excellent work of our team who were met with several timeline challenges during COVID and completed the facility within our financial expectations. Our new industry leading processing facility, focused on water conservation and waste reduction, aligns Altiplano with our commitment to sustainable and responsible growth.""*"|0.94|31|0|31

**Helbiz (HLBZ) Signs Letter of Intent to Acquire Wheels, Accretive Acquisition Expected to Double Revenue. Look at the Resumes on Some of the Wheels Executives. Wheel's Executives Held Previous Positions at Uber, Lyft, Tesla, Zipcar, Bird, Ford and More.**

**This acquisition is a huge catalyst for HLBZ.**

Good day everyone,

**Helbiz, Inc. (NASDAQ: HLBZ)** offers a diverse fleet of vehicles including e-scooters, e-bicycles, and e-mopeds in the fast growing the micro-mobility services sector along with a media segment and food delivery.

Current price $.89/share (+7% as of 9:35 a.m. EDT 6-21-22)

After closing the past Friday‚Äôs session with an 18% gain to $.83/share, HLBZ opened today‚Äôs session strong on news of an accretive acquisition, jumping to $.92/share with over one million shares traded in the first few minutes.

In [news that just broke this morning](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helbiz-signs-letter-intent-acquire-124500791.html), and could be a major catalyst for HLBZ‚Äôs value, the company announced that they signed a letter of intent to acquire Wheels, a leading last-mile, shared electric mobility platform using proprietary vehicles with integrated helmet technology. The company‚Äôs mix of business includes shared mobility, a subscription business, and a B2B operation, partnering with businesses to provide their employees and patrons with a vehicle as a benefit.

**The acquisition will give HLBZ immediate and broader access to the U.S. market.**

Wheels has eight thousand vehicles deployed across major U.S. markets, including New York City, Honolulu, and Austin. Wheels is the only operator across the four permitted markets of metropolitan Los Angeles (L.A., Santa Monica, West Hollywood, and Culver City). In total, Wheels operates in twelve cities and four universities across the United States.

**Wheels was founded in 2018 and is led by veterans of the micro-mobility and shared transportation industries including Zipcar, Bird, and Uber**. ""Our businesses are complementary in really powerful ways,"" said Marco McCottry, CEO of Wheels. McCottry was formerly Midwest operations manager at Uber and led North American operations at Bird.

About Wheels [https://takewheels.com/](https://takewheels.com/)  
Wheels is a last mile, shared electric mobility platform whose seated form factor changes the landscape in dockless mobility. In addition to being seated, Wheels devices have a low center of gravity and 14-inch wheels to help navigate uneven pavement surfaces. Wheels has launched a first-of-its-kind integrated helmet system that can give riders physical access to a shareable helmet with every ride they take. Because of its unique design, Wheels devices have a broad appeal, with half of its riders being women and one-third being over 35. Wheels is headquartered in West Hollywood, California.

Stay tuned for a full report on this exciting catalyst for HLBZ.

The Traders News Team

**original report below**  
**Revenues are Rising Fast at Helbiz (HLBZ) in a Hot Sector with a 17% CAGR and the CEO Just Spent Over $2M Buying up Helbiz Stock**

Gas prices are setting the micro-mobility market on fire.

Good morning and welcome to all of our new trading group members,

Gas prices are just one factor boosting the micro mobility market and **Helbiz, Inc. (NASDAQ: HLBZ)** is a leader offering a diverse fleet of vehicles including e-scooters, e-bicycles, and e-mopeds in the fast growing micro-mobility services sector. Helbiz operates a fast growing media segment and food delivery / ghost kitchen service as well.

**Current price $.83/share as of the close on 06/17/22**

HLBZ looks ready to pop as the company keeps adding elements to its different operating segments and growing revenues. HLBZ derives half its revenues from the micro-mobility market and the other half from its media subscriptions. **Coming soon may be notable revenues from its ghost kitchen/food delivery segment.**

**There‚Äôs a lot to like at HBLZ**

**FYE is 12-31, MRQ is 3-31-22**  
Outstanding shares 19.8M  
Shares in float 8.7M  
Insider ownership 81.1%  
Revenues (ttm) $15.1M  
Q122 revenues up 266% over Q121  
FYE2021 revenue up 290% over FYE2020  
Market cap $28.3M (P/S is only 1.80X)

On June 6th, the company announced that **CEO Salvatore Palella purchased 2,044,676 common shares** from a seller at $.99/share bringing the executive‚Äôs total holdings in the company to 4,544,676 common shares. Mr. Palella commented ""This purchase today is a personal commitment from me on the future of the company and our continued success.""

**Recent developments / potential catalysts:**

Approximately 3,000 leased e-Scooters delivered on March 1, expanding fleet in service.

Expanding operations into Miami Dade County, Belgrade Serbia, Charlotte N.C.

Partnership with Google Maps.

Added Major League Baseball (MLB) on the Helbiz Live platform.

Agreement with Amazon Prime to offer Helbiz Live Platform.

**HLBZ operates three revenue streams and sells subscriptions to their apps giving customers access to their products:**

**Mobility** ‚Äì Operating globally in 40 cities. HLBZ has thousands of e-scooters, e-bicycles, and e-mopeds parked all over these cities. Quite simply, clients locate the nearest transport they need on the app, go to it, and scan the QR code to unlock it and then go. The app also ensures you are properly parked when finished. **In addition to all vehicles being electric, every component of a HLBZ transport device is recyclable.**

**Kitchen** ‚Äì HLBZ delivers food and is currently developing their Helbiz Kitchen segment already operating in Milan. Using the ghost kitchen concept allows customers to mix cuisines in a single order with a quick delivery using an environmentally friendly transport.

**Helbiz Media** \- is a live sports and entertainment platform focused primarily on live coverage of Series B Soccer. The service, available by subscription, is available on mobile, tablet, on the web, or on smart TV and covers twenty clubs with over 390 matches as well as playoffs.

Recently the company signed an OTT service agreement to broadcast MLB games in Italy for the next three seasons. **A recent agreement with Amazon will allow for a subscription to Helbiz Live to be purchased through Amazon Prime. That‚Äôs big- time exposure!**

According to Precedence research, the Micro-mobility Market was estimated at $48.1B in 2021 and is expected to grow to $198B by 2030 indicating a CAGR of 17%. The research cites factors such as fuel prices, road congestion, and limited parking in cities as factors for an elevated level of growth in the sector.

The chart set up indicated below looks primed for continued gains after the 18% swing in last Friday‚Äôs session. The low RSI (14) of 38.15 indicates to me this stock is oversold. Trading volumes in the month of June have been higher than the preceding five months this year indicating significant investor interest.

We have a lot more to cover with Helbiz, keep an eye out for an updated report coming soon.

# What is the big news?

AbbVie, the 3rd largest pharmaceutical company in the world based on revenue ($56.1 billion 2021), signed a global exclusive licensing deal with Sirona Biochem.

[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/13/2461193/0/en/Sirona-Biochem-Announces-Exclusive-Global-Licensing-Agreement-with-Allergan-Aesthetics.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/13/2461193/0/en/Sirona-Biochem-Announces-Exclusive-Global-Licensing-Agreement-with-Allergan-Aesthetics.html)

# Why does it matter, and why this stock has potential?

The licensing deal is for Sirona Biochem‚Äôs library of cosmetic compounds, including its breakthrough TFC-1067 skin lightening active ingredient. I‚Äôm positive the stock will go up when this news spreads, or at least get to the right ears, as this deal doesn‚Äôt just impact the company but also the wider cosmetics market. 

According to the company‚Äôs tests and those conducted by third-party laboratories, Sirona‚Äôs TFC-1067 smokes the current ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù active ingredient for skin lightening, hydroquinone. AbbVie already holds a substantial stake in the aesthetic and cosmetics market, which means it has the infrastructure and the finances to get the product to market quickly and effectively. 

# A little bit of background 

Sirona Biochem and its subsidiary TFChem have been working on this ingredient for over a decade. It is synthesized from the blood of some deep water fish found in the antarctic. 

The company was founded on a proprietary carbohydrate bonding technology platform that enables it to synthesize unique compounds that can be used in various ways, including becoming active ingredients in medical and cosmetic products. 

I won‚Äôt go much into detail, but if you are interested, you can check out their investor‚Äôs presentation about their technology and pipeline. 

[https://www.sironabiochem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sirona-Corporate-Deck.pdf](https://www.sironabiochem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sirona-Corporate-Deck.pdf)

# Now back to the stock

Before they published the news release about the AbbVie deal, Sirona‚Äôs stock was trading between CA$18 and CA$23 on the TSX Venture. It was at a similar range on the OTC and in Frankfurt. (TSX-V: SBM) (FSE: ZSB) (OTC: SRBCF)

With a market cap of around $50 million, Sirona is significantly undersold. I believe more volume will pour in once news of its deal reaches more ears, particularly with institutional investors. I was able to enter reasonably low as I just happened to come by their release at the right time. 

Based on several analysis articles and my own research, the stock could very well jump to CA$1 over the first few weeks and then possibly over CA$2 once AbbVie publishes more information.

# Conclusion

Sirona Biochem has the hallmarks of a 10-bagger stock. It has the reputation and awards to back it up, and its bonding platform gives it an edge over other companies trying to create novel new cosmetic compounds. The company has also filed more than 80 patents worldwide, which means it has the ammunition to keep the momentum going once it becomes a semi-major player.

Nice to see a leader put his money where his mouth is.

Vejii has grown its business to 5 distribution centres in the US, and 1 in Canada. Now they are an e-commerce marketplace shipping frozen goods, and we all saw how well that worked out for VERY, so my biggest concern was can they control selling and distribution costs, and G&amp;A given their recent acquisitions.

They just released their Q1 and here are the key highlights from my perspective:

\- Revenues grow 65% to 1.54M for Q1 2022 compared to Q4 2021

\- After integration of 2 acquisitions, selling and distribution only increase 3% for Q1 2021 compared to Q4 2021

\- G&amp;A increased by 46% for Q1 2022 vs Q4 2021, but in COO comments he does say ‚ÄúOur G&amp;A this quarter includes restructuring costs associated with business integrations‚Äù I can only assume he means severances, so looks like that will come down next quarter

They also showed something a lot of other junior companies in the space so not, KPIs in the press release:

\- Total user active user accounts did drop to 25,847 for Q1 2022 vs 29,715 Q4 2021 which could be conserving expect they actually grew revenues by 65%, so that means they are getting more revenue per active user

\- Yotal orders increased to 10,157 in Q1 2022 vs 9504 for Q4 2022, meaning the smaller active user base is ordering more often

\- Average order side increased 129.03 in Q1 2022 vs 77.19 from Q4 2021, now

I do want to point out that they acquired a B2B business at end of 2021 so this could be including higher order values on that side

\- Cost of customer acquisition is down to 20.66 and return on ad spend is improving, so it mean they are efficient at marketing to their target customer

\- CEO seems committed given he has invested over 1.4M into the company, above the 500K he already put in, something I can‚Äôt say I have seen any other CEO of a company do, especially in this market

When I compare this to companies like VERY or VEGA looks like this is the only one with a shot at short term profitability, as the others are burning through cash on G&amp;A, marketing and Selling and distribution at a far greater rate.

Based on Q1 run rate they should do about 6-6.5M this year but they did announce targeting 10M-12M, based on closing price today of $0.11, the total market cap is $3.1M, seems like a great opportunity to me even if they only hit the 6M this year.

Top Draw News Out Today - [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-draw-animation-signs-950-120000510.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-draw-animation-signs-950-120000510.html)

NASDAQ listing rule under $1 notice issued but they have 180 days.

The chart setup indicates trending shares, recently moving past their SMA20.

Good day everyone,

Update, **Grom Social Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: GROM)** the social media company just for kids, and a creator of media content for animated films and televisions series.

Current price $.7449/share (at market close 5-31-22)

GROM is building a social empire geared toward children under thirteen,  an age group that parents, grandparents, and other family members love  to spend on. The current price of GROM shares must seem irresistible to a  considerable number of investors, even institutions have grabbed up  8.7% of the company.

GROM has assembled so much talent, formerly associated with Nickelodeon, it seems like they could repeat that success story.

GROM has made several moves in H1 this year that could translate to  revenues in H2. I think the changes at Santa.com will be a big one  during the holiday season this year. While Santa.com was up and running  last year, this upcoming season will be the first with the ability for  purchase of merchandise.

**Here are the latest developments at GROM:**

[Global  Toy Company Cepia Taps Curiosity Ink Media to Serve as Licensing Agent  for Hit Toy &amp; Entertainment Franchise, Cats vs Pickles¬Æ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/team-cat-team-pickle-120000693.html)

The company has announced it will partner with Cepia LLC to serve as  licensing agent for the hit toy and entertainment franchise, Cats vs  Pickles.

The licensing partnership builds on the Curiosity-Cepia relationship  established in 2021, an alliance to develop Cats vs Pickles into a  widely distributed animated series featuring the hilarious cast of  characters from the wildly popular Cats vs Pickles product line. In  addition to entertainment content, Curiosity Ink Media has also signed  on to develop multiple publishing titles, planned for 2022 and 2023  release. The first book in the series, Everybody Loves Cats vs Pickles  is slated for release in September of 2022.

**GROM statistics:**

**Recent developments at GROM that may contribute to revenues in the near term:**

Curiosity announced the new Mr. Zip book series, teaming up with the USPS.

Top Draw Media has announced two major contracts, one for $950K on February 2nd, and another for $1.15M on April 21st of this year. TDM currently accounts for most of the revenues at GROM.

Grom brought in Melanie Bartlett, a marketing executive known for  bringing beloved animated properties to consumers, as a consultant.

Unveiled The Legion of Forgettable Supervillains, an original  intellectual property franchise which will debut as a graphic novel in  partnership with publisher, Dynamite Entertainment.

Partnered with iconic comedian Maz Jobrani to develop an original animated sitcom, Laugh on Lorb.

Secured Montana Poet Laureate M.L. Smoker to write and consult for the  Thunderous graphic novel series, debuting in partnership with publisher  Dynamite Entertainment.

Engaged the services of veteran brand builder and design expert Richard  Manville's Richard Manville Studio, to guide design for the company's  holiday entertainment and shopping hub, Santa.com.

Enlisted Afterglow Pictures LLC to assist in the development and  distribution of the company's expanding roster of original animated  franchise properties.

GROM shares have passed their SMA20 of $.63 and are moving toward their SMA50 of $.84/share.

**What I'm bullish on:**

**Yamana Gold ($AUY)**

* Yamana Gold is a top 10 global gold producer trading at bargain prices. Q2 stock performance has been steady. I expect short term appreciation to keep going up as institutional ownership increases. (Blackstone, Vanguard, and other high street behemoths).

**Benchmark Metals ($BNCHF)**

* BM a gold short-squeeze/growth play at a great entry price. They're behind one of the leading gold drills in North America (Lawyers) which is currently undergoing the first stages of a transition phase into an operating mine. Backed by Auy and Sprott Capital."|0.86|32|0|32

i heard about monkeypox like two weeks ago and thought, wow did us apes actually get a disease named after us.

and then i realized that when they said it doesnt spread that easily it couldnt be us, we are contagious. At first they said its homosexuals at a rave but just yesterday a woman in the United Arab Emirates tested positive so....

Let's talk about what happens when they realize there are likely over a thousand cases of this.

Its in the US, 10 cases in Canada, the UK alone has 78!!!! cases, all over Europe and now getting to even more places around the world (16 countries so far). Thing is, I don't think it will really affect markets much, here is why.

There is currently a vaccine and a treatment for it. Lots of these stocks blew up in the last few days, but have cooled down with the exception of one.

$BVNKF A European company from Denmark, has a vaccine for monkeynut and is already contracted to sell vaccines and is in talks with various countries to distribute. NOONE will risk covid part 2.

Now most of us do not trade OTC stonks because we aren't true degens so here are the other options.

$SIGA - They created TPOXX, an antiviral that is effective in treating smallpox and monkeypox. They are FDA approved and as cases rise, they would be key in order to ensure that people who have monkeypox can be cured. if you like shorted stocks, well these puppies got shorted to all hell off the hype, with fintel reporting a 64% borrow rate on $SIGA

There are two main alternatives:

$TNXP - a true penny stock that has made a smallpox vaccine in the past and a company who agreed to sell their vaccine which may not even be effective against monkeyballs to $EBS the company that messed up those 80 Million or so JnJ vaccines in 2021.

News about how we are seeing more cases, will see more cases, and countries are taking action already.

Swing trade, look at the chart|" **Altamira (NASDAQ: CYTO) broke the 20DMA, looking for move over the 50DMA at .94/share. If WE can break this .90 wall its off to the races. Call on everyone** 

&amp;#x200B;

This one could swing quickly, look at the chart setup.M&amp;A activity in the RNA sector is strong.See list of near-term catalysts below

**Altamira Therapeutics Ltd. (NASDAQ: CYTO)** is a biopharma company developing RNA therapeutics for unmet medical needs.

Current price $.81/share (at market close 5-18-22)

Following the acquisition of Trasir Therapeutics Inc. last year CYTO is  focusing on RNA therapeutics and its OligoPhore‚Ñ¢ / SemaPhore‚Ñ¢ platform  for extrahepatic RNA delivery (more on that below). The company  continues to progress towards upcoming key catalysts with its (non-RNA)  legacy programs as well.

While the company recorded nominal Revenues of $100K in 2021, they have  indicated that Q122 revenues have exceeded that figure by 2.50X. Their  product Bentrio, an over-the-counter nasal spray treatment for allergies  and viruses (more on that below), is gaining commercial success,  developing sales channels across the globe. The company is considering a  spin-off, licensing or sale of that product to help fund their RNA  therapeutics, a sector they believe will be more lucrative.

I want to look briefly at the CYTO pipeline but would urge you to [visit the company website](https://altamiratherapeutics.com/) and investor deck found there to get detailed information.

**CYTO pipeline of RNA therapy:**

Altamira is developing OligoPhore‚Ñ¢ / SemaPhore‚Ñ¢ as a versatile platform  for safe and effective delivery of nucleic acid payloads such as siRNA  (small interfering ribonucleic acid), mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid)  into target cells, using systemic or local administration.

Delivery into target cells and tissues has proved to be a major  challenge and the RNA payload that becomes available within the cells  has been reported at 1-2%. CYTO wants to leverage their platform through  collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies and the  out-licensing of technology for other indications.

**CYTO is becoming an RNA delivery platform company.**

According to Researchandmarkets.com, the market for mRNA vaccines and  therapeutics was $46.7B in 2021 and will grow to $101.3B in 2026  representing a CAGR of 16.8%. The market for siRNA, over the same period  will grow from $4.9B to $11.0B.

The company has initiated a preclinical development program and is  aiming for FDA IND in 2023 to be followed by clinical proof-of-concept  study.

**Recent M&amp;A activity in the RNA biopharma sector:**

Tidal Therapeutics (mRNA delivery, preclinical stage), acquired in 2021  by Sanofi for $160M upfront + up to $310M milestone payments.

Translate Bio (mRNA delivery), recently acquired by Sanofi for $3.2B

Dicerna (specializing in hepatic delivery), recently acquired by Novo for $3B

**The CYTO legacy pipeline (the company may divest or spin off these products):**

Bentrio is a novel drug-free nasal spray for protection against  airborne viruses and allergens now being commercialized in Germany and  other European countries as an ""over the counter"" product. The company  is currently involved in Bentrio allergen studies in Canada and  Australia with results expected over the next few quarters.

In viral infection, Altamira has demonstrated *in vitro* on human  nasal epithelia cells that Bentrio lowers infectious viral titers when  applied prior to or after infection with SARS-CoV-2 not only in the wild  type, but also the Delta and Omicron variants. Similar effects in the  same type of assay were also shown in H1N1 influenza virus infection.

In recent updates the company said its COVAMID studies for the treatment  of Covid-19 with Bentrio in Bulgaria have reached the midpoint of  patient enrollment and the same study in North Macedonia has been  approved for extended clinical study. CYTO expects to report results in  both studies in Q322.

To date, Bentrio has been cleared for sale in the countries of the  European Union, Switzerland, UK, Singapore, and Malaysia and is  currently generating revenues in those areas. For accessing the US  market, the Company filed with the FDA in October 2021 a 510(k)  application for premarket clearance of Bentrio in the allergy indication  and that application is still under FDA review.

The AM-125 program for the treatment of vertigo is currently in  the TRAVERS Phase 2b clinical trial. In March this year, the company was  able to complete enrollment in the trial, which recruited 75 patients  with acute vertigo following neurosurgery. Top-line data from the trial  are expected for 2Q-2022.

The product is an intranasal formulation of betahistine, a standard of  care in vertigo treatment and management around the world, except in the  US. Even without a US market, worldwide sales of oral betahistine are  approximately $450 million. CYTO is currently preparing the submission  of an IND to the FDA for the next steps in the clinical development of  AM-125.

Keyzilen¬Æ (AM-101) for the treatment of acute inner ear tinnitus and Sonsuvi¬Æ (AM-111)  for the treatment of acute inner ear hearing loss have both been  evaluated in Phase 3 trials but will require further clinical testing.

**Near term potential catalysts for CYTO:**

Expect read-outs on house dust mite challenge Bentrio study with  allergic rhinitis patients in the current, second quarter of 2022.

Top line data from AM-125 TRAVERS Phase 2 is anticipated in the current, second quarter of 2022.

Preparing the submission of an IND to the FDA for the next steps in the clinical development of the AM-125 program for vertigo.Seasonal allergic rhinitis NASAR clinical Bentrio trial is expected to  report top line data in fourth quarter of 2022 or first quarter of 2023.

COVAMID trial with Bentrio in acute COVID-19 may be completed in 3Q 2022.

In the RNA-based business, plan to submit an IND to the FDA in 2023 for KRAS-driven cancer treatment using RNA therapeutics.

Expected FDA feedback on Bentrio 510(k) submission.

**CYTO statistics:**

FYE is December 31.52-week high is $4.58/shareOutstanding 15.2M sharesFloat 13.5M sharesBook value (mrq) $.85/shareMarket cap $11.4M

When I look at the chart below, with the double bottom formed, along  with the fact that CYTO shares are currently priced below their book  value, I see what looks to be an oversold opportunity.

I want to update you on **Grom Social Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: GROM)** the social media company just for kids, and a creator of media content for animated films and televisions series.

Current price $.57/share (at market close 5-13-22)  
Book value $1.85/share (mrq)

Two subsidiaries of GROM, Top Draw Animation and Curiosity Ink Media. Top Draw has been the main revenue generator at GROM with 400 artists generating 2D animation for television and film providers and they have done so since 1999. Curiosity Ink was acquired by GROM in August of last year and is a developer of original story telling content. Both subsidiaries are headed by Russell Hicks, formerly President of Nickelodeon Animation Studios, who has masterminded countless iconic franchises like Scooby-Doo, SpongeBob, and Dora the Explorer.

Top Draw may continue to be the lead revenue generator for GROM through H122 as they continue to book significant business. That could change however in H222 with Curiosity Ink‚Äôs Santa.com hitting full stride during the holiday season. While Santa.com was operational in 2021, it did not yet have ecommerce capacity and it will in the 2022 season (see press release below). Their ecommerce capabilities, combined with the marketing experts they have onboard could lead to significant revenues in the 2022 holiday season.

**Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new at GROM:**

Last week, [the company confirmed the fall return](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grom-social-enterprises-inc-curiosity-120000096.html) of Santa.com, the company's digital online hub, where kids and adults can shop and experience the joys of the holiday season. The addition of e-commerce at Santa.com this year (was not in place last year) places Grom and Curiosity squarely in the booming holiday e-tail business. Santa.com will feature easy to navigate features for gift giving, entertaining, decorating as well as games and a digital North Pole experience.

In collaboration with publishing partner Dynamite Entertainment, Curiosity Ink Media will also be launching four holiday books: How the North Pole Works, Snow Boy, The Adventures of Herbert Henry, Santa's Secret Society and Baldwin's Big Christmas Delivery. Additionally, the company is in development on an original, **animated musical holiday feature film**, inspired by annual classics like ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"" and ""Elf.""

GROM's Hollywood-based division, [Curiosity Ink Media, announced](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grom-social-enterprises-curiosity-ink-120000657.html) that it has enlisted Afterglow Pictures, LLC to assist in the development and distribution of the company's expanding roster of original animated franchise properties. Curiosity was founded in 2017 by former Nickelodeon executive, Russell Hicks, advertising executive, Brent Watts and toy/marketing/production executive, Jared Wolfson. GROM acquired a majority stake in Curiosity Ink Media in 2021.

**GROM statistics:**  
FYE 12-31  
Book value (mrq) $1.85/share  
Market cap $10.8M  
Cash (mrq) $6.5M  
Outstanding 18.7M shares  
Float 15.5M shares  
Insiders own 16.5%

The chart below, and the statistics above, can only reinforce my thoughts that GROM shares have been oversold.

GZ6G Technologies (GZIC) Turns Revenue Positive and is Seeking Accretive Acquisitions of Managed Service Providers (MSPs)

&amp;#x200B;

Good day everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

GZ6G Technologies Corp. (OTCQB: GZIC), is an enterprise smart solutions provider for cities, stadiums, universities, and other large venues (5G).

&amp;#x200B;

Current price $.795/share (as of 12:25 pm EDT 5-10-22)

&amp;#x200B;

These are some of the things I like about GZIC:

&amp;#x200B;

GZIC has a tiny share structure (float 12M)

GZIC is partnered with Lumen Technologies (LUMN) an $11B company

Revenues began streaming in Q42021

Insider ownership is 51.9%

&amp;#x200B;

GZIC is working to complete accretive acquisitions of managed service providers (MSPs)

&amp;#x200B;

Through a group of four business units, GZIC provides smart digital technologies through their proprietary platform to offer 5G and Wi-Fi 6 technology applications, advising on critical decisions about how best to store, process and protect data, upgrade facilities and more, with emerging wireless and IoT applications.

&amp;#x200B;

GZIC has partnered with Lumen Technologies (LUMN), previously CenturyLink, one of the largest telecommunications organizations in the country. As a third-party solutions partner, GZ6G Technologies offers the smart solution tools and expertise required for Lumen Technology to develop long term user engagement solutions. The potential for growth from this Lumen partnership could be huge.

&amp;#x200B;

The $78K in revenues that GZIC generated in 2021 came from their partnership with Lumen and was all generated in Q421. The city of West Des Moines, Iowa‚Äôs new Recplex sport venue project, was a new development when the five-year Agreement with Lumen was signed. IT sponsorship managed service revenue began as the West Des Moines Recplex opened to the public last October.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what‚Äôs happening right now at GZIC:

&amp;#x200B;

GZIC is hosting an open house and ribbon-cutting ceremony May 17 at 4 p.m. PDT. to commemorate the Company‚Äôs newest office in Irvine, California. ‚ÄúWe are inviting business professionals in Irvine and the surrounding area to network with colleagues and enjoy an immersive experience, including a firsthand look at how venues will operate with our Wi-Fi and IPTV connected technology,‚Äù said Karl Hoenecke, Director of Operations and Sales.

&amp;#x200B;

The Company is working to identify and complete acquisitions of managed service providers (MSPs) and other smart digital technology companies in cities nationwide to enhance and expand its GZ Smart Networks division capabilities. Acquisition candidates must have existing revenue, IT support teams and technology solutions in place for at least three years. The Company is looking for MSPs that generate from $1 million to $10 million in revenues.

&amp;#x200B;

Four divisions of GZIC:

&amp;#x200B;

Smart Networks offers local enterprise-level IT and wireless network technology consulting services, business technology infrastructure strategy and planning services, as well as IT networking hardware and security cloud software products and services.

&amp;#x200B;

Smart Labs is the leading provider for in-venue wireless and user engagement, marketing, advertising platforms, data analytics, CRM, API software development, AI (artificial intelligence), research and development, platform integration solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

Smart Data focuses on safe and secure data storage solutions and co-location and leasing options for venues, cities, and other customers. Green Zebra Data Centers support and optimize in-user software applications across GZ6G Technologies‚Äô divisions, and are essential for storing, processing, and disseminating data and applications.

&amp;#x200B;

Smart Media is a provider for in-venue wireless and user engagement, marketing, advertising platforms, data analytics, CRM, API software development, AI (artificial intelligence), research and development, platform integration solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

I've included a video presentation by Coleman Smith, CEO and President of GZIC, discussing exactly what the company does.

&amp;#x200B;

GZ6G statistics:

&amp;#x200B;

FYE is 12-31

52-week high is $2.75/share

**Introduction**

Inflation and interest rates hikes are hitting the general stock market and our daily life pretty hard. 

And because a big part of that inflation is due to supply chain disruptions and commodity prices that went significantly higher in 2021 and the first months of 2022, I don't think that high inflation will be gone soon.

Yes, the oil price could go a bit lower (end 2022 or in 2023? Future will tell) when many people start to spend less, travel less, ... because they have to spend more money on energy bills, mortages, rent, food, ...

But other commodities, like wheat (war and drought), gas (growing demand), copper (growing demand), ... will remain significantly higher in the coming years compared to early 2021.

And other commodities are going to go significantly higher from here in the coming years, like uranium, some REE

Most of the investors don't know uranium like an investment, but the uranium sector is in a multi-year bull market due to:

\- an inevitable growing global primary uranium supply deficit, 

\- much more new reactors being build today (China alone will cause an \~30% global uranium demand increase, and you also have India, ... building more reactors as we speak) than reactors being closed,

\- more and more reactors getting operational license extensions (USA, FR, Canada, Japan, South Korea, UK, ...)

\- panic higher in the fuel cycle that will push the uranium price even higher in the future

For more information: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/u31unn/a\_couple\_aspects\_about\_the\_multiyear\_bull\_trend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/u31unn/a_couple_aspects_about_the_multiyear_bull_trend/)

Due to inflation in Material, Fuel, Labour, ... the production cost of miners in all commodities are increasing significantly, the consequence is that to make a profit those miners have to sell their commodities at a much higher price. 

In the uranium sector that situation happens at the same time as a new multi-year contracting cyle in the sector. 

Today Uranium is still significantly under the needed price to get the global uranium supply and demand back in equilibrium. 

The needed price now is \~80 USD/lb

Today the uranium price is \~54.50 USD/lb.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now one aspect more in detail: An own house and other hard assets like owning physical uranium that is still at a significant lower price  than the price needed to get the global supply and demand back in  equilibrium, are the best ways to protect yourself against high  inflation + interest rates 2004-2007 vs uranium price 2004-2007**

 A couple thoughts:

2) The FED increased interest rates from 1% in 2004 to June 2006 (5.25%) and the 5.25% remained unchanged until september 2007, uranium  spotprice went from \~16 USD/lb in early 2004 to \~140 USD/lb in \~ August 2007

&amp;#x200B;

 2) Money mass today is \~3x the Money mass in 2007, but in 2007 the  Combined market cap of the entire uranium sector was a couple times the  combined market of it today ‚Äî&gt; a lot of catching up to do :-) 

https://preview.redd.it/lsndwz722wx81.png?width=1136&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=596af7f91a0bea5610c2098ab99705ec73457576

3) Money mass today is \~3x the Money  mass in 2007, but in 2007 an uranium price of\~50 $/lb was needed to have  equilibrium in the sector

‚Äî&gt;  Does that mean that if all Material (Iron, Copper, Fuel, ‚Ä¶), Electricity  and Labour cost is correctly reevaluated in the near future compared to  a money mass that tripled between 2007 and today, pushing the  production cost of mining any commodity much higher, that we would  approach a needed uranium price of 80 USD/lb U3O8 (or even higher) now  to get the global uranium supply and demand back in equilibrium a couple  years later?

Well, today that  needed 80 USD/lb is already comfirmed by increasing production cost, by  Cameco saying that the US assets could come back online in the future if  at least 80 USD/lb is paid, ‚Ä¶ ;-)

Now  the FED will try to decrease the Money Mass, but will they be able to  decrease as much as they are telling the market today? I think not.

Very soon the economy in general will go in recession due to consumption decrease.

And by consequence in my opinion the FED will be pushed to be less hawkish  sooner than expected today (early 2023? Future will tell).

**Big advantage of uranium in all that is that the consumption of uranium  doesn‚Äôt decrease when economies go into recession, because nuclear power is baseload power and continues to produce electricity when the economy  is slowing down**

**Conclusion:**

For me buying physical uranium through Yellow Cake and Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN on the TSX or SRUUF on US stock exchange) is the best way, after owning an own house, to protect  myself against high inflation in the period 2022/2024, because already  today 80 USD/lb is needed while I can buy physical uranium today at a  value of \~50 USD/lb (= discount over NAV at the moment)

Sprott Physical Uranium Trust : [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)

The market can go further down, but even than 80 USD/lb transactions will take place, because if not more reactors will need to shutdown due to a lack of uranium supply ON TIME.

If you are interested in higher risk investments in this sector than physical uranium through Sprott Physical Uranium Trust, there are a couple very beautiful and cheap companies out there, like Global Atomic, Paladin Energy, Denison Mines, ... (but than you need to look at it as an investment for 2022/2024)

**INM Recently Transitioned from Development Stage to Revenue Producer**

Good day everyone,

InMed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: INM) operates in the research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of rare cann-a-binoids and treatments developed from them.

Current price $.75/share

INM has a FYE of June 30, so they are currently operating in fiscal Q4. The big development for the company in this fiscal year is their transition into a revenue generating enterprise, an event reported in their Q2 earnings release when they posted $256K in sales.

We will have to wait a few more weeks to learn what kind of revenues were generated in their Q3 ended on March 31 However, I want to talk about INM now because the current company value is hard to ignore. **The company‚Äôs cash position on 12-31-21 (mrq) exceeds the current market cap! Book value is $1.00/share.**

**Here‚Äôs why I think INM is a winner and ready to run...**

Huge Acquisition of BayMedica Could Be the Game-Changer of all Game-Changers for InMed

InMed Boasts an Unparalleled Cann-a-binoid Manufacturing Expertise

The Company has 2 Cann-a-binoid Dr-ug Development Programs (INM-755 and INM-088) with Huge Market Potential

InMed has the ability for commercial-scale production of TH-CV, in addition to CBC and CBT for potential supply to large buyers in the pharma, and health and wellness markets.

As indicated above, INM is in the business of rare cann-a-binoids. These compounds come from the same plants as C-B-D but are harder to extract and exist in much smaller quantities. Some of the rare cannabinoids of current interest include cannabigerol (CBG), cannabinol (CBN), cannabidivarin (CB-DV), cannabidiorcin (CB-DO) and tetrahydrocannabivarin (TH-CV).

**Acquisition of BayMedica; This is what their new subsidiary brings to the table:**

* Proprietary manufacturing platforms for naturally occurring rare cann-a-binoids for the consumer Health and Wellness marketplace.
* Sector-leading capabilities in synthetic biology and chemical synthesis.
* Novel cann-a-binoid analogs for pharma R&amp;D.
* Early and growing revenue stream in nutraceuticals, more than $2.5M pre-acquisition cumulative sales.
* Leader in large batch production of the rare cann-a-binoid C-B-C ‚Äì currently 200kg batches with ability to scale to metric tons.
* Launched C-B-T in 1Q22.
* Poised to launch additional high-margin rare cann-a-binoids for B2B sales in next 3-6 months.

**There are over 100 rare cann-a-binoids out there. This could be only the start of something even bigger.**

The competition for C-B-D products is fierce and the number of shops and websites selling them is mind boggling but rare cann-a-binoids is an entirely different market with far fewer competitors. InMed and their U.S. subsidiary BayMedica produce rare cann-a-binoids using a variety of manufacturing techniques including biosynthesis, chemical synthesis, and their integrated approach, IntegraSyn‚Ñ¢.

A December 2021 Grand View Research report predicts the retail market for rare cann-a-binoids will reach US$26 Billion by 2028.

A week ago,[ INM announced](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inmed-commercializes-cannabidivarin-cbdv-expanding-113000006.html) it launched B2B sales of the rare cann-a-binoid cannabidivarin (CB-DV) through its US subsidiary, BayMedica LLC. CB-DV is one of the most studied rare cannabinoids and has been the subject of research in autism, epilepsy, acne, alopecia, inflammatory bowel disease, nausea, and pain. CB-DV is also currently being studied in several clinical trials including autism, Prader-Willi Syndrome, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

The company anticipates adding tetrahydrocann-a-bivarin (THCV) to their portfolio in their current Q4. They currently offer Cann-a-bichromene (CBC) and Cann-a-bicitran (CBT) and are in development for Cannn-a-bigerovarin (CBGV) and Cann-a-bicyclol (CBL).

What sets INM apart from the competition is their proprietary method of extraction:

The scalable and flexible **IntegraSyn‚Ñ¢ manufacturing** approach integrates multiple commercially proven pharmaceutical methods to efficiently produce cann-a-binoids, utilizing cost-effective processes. IntegraSyn‚Ñ¢ is designed to produce the consistent, compliant, highly pure cann-a-binoids required for pharmaceutical products.

**INM drug development programs:**

Cann-a-binol (CBN) is the key active pharmaceutical ingredient in InMed‚Äôs INM-755 for epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is being studied in a Phase 2 clinical trial. This study will be taking place at 13 sites across eight countries including Austria, Germany, Greece, France, Italy, Israel, Serbia and Spain. Five clinical sites have been fully activated. Enrollment and patient treatment began in December 2021 and are expected to complete during the calendar year 2022.

**INM-755: Positive Top-Line Results:**

INM-755 Creams Safe &amp; Well Tolerated on Intact Skin and Epidermal Wounds  
On intact skin (Study 101, n=22 healthy adult volunteers, 14 days):  
Majority of subjects in all groups had no events on most days.  
Slightly higher incidence and severity of arythema (redness) and scaling (flaking skin) in groups receiving active creams compared to vehicle cream.  
On epidermal wounds (Study 102, n=8 healthy adult volunteers, 14 days):  
No differences in local reactions compared to controls.  
No adverse effects of INM-755 creams on wound healing.  
Phase 2 Clinical Trial in EB Commenced (1)  
First time CBN has advanced to a Phase 2 Clinical trial.

INM-088 (with Cann-a-binol CBN) is a topical eye drop formulation under development for the treatment of glaucoma. InMed is preparing for a pre-Investigational New Drug meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (‚ÄúFDA‚Äù) and expects to file regulatory applications in the first half of calendar year 2023, to initiate a human clinical trial.

**Target Effects of CBN in glaucoma:**

Direct neuroprotection for the retina and optic nerve, independent of intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction.

Reduce IOP in the affected eyes via increased fluid drainage.  
InMed data suggest CBN is the cann-a-binoid of choice for neuroprotection in the eye.

In vitro studies demonstrated CBN protects the retinal ganglion cells from cell death under elevated pressure conditions.

In vitro studies indicated that CBN may be able to reduce intraocular pressure.

CBN appears to have a wide therapeutic window for neuroprotection.

Studies compared CBN with several other cann-a-binoids.

InMed‚Äôs division, BayMedica, has produced an extensive library of novel cann-a-binoid analogs. These cann-a-binoid analogs are patentable new chemical entities (NCEs) for pharmaceutical development.

**INM statistics:**

Book value $1.00/share  
Revenue (ttm) $265k  
Outstanding shares 14.36M  
Shares in float 13.75M  
FYE June 30th

INM has slipped below all its SMA levels as the overall market corrects. The chart below could indicate INM is close to a bottom to bounce from. I note the low RSI (14) of 40.4 and the development of a potential double bottom.

Dear reader, let me introduce you to $SATL, or Satellogic. 

‚Äã

https://preview.redd.it/jingtjgqszv81.jpg?width=303&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb04021e6c7a21f6791c9dedc4e58727814824e6

It‚Äôs a de-spac (merger complete January 26th 2022) that is looking to ‚Äúdemocratize access to critical geospatial data‚Äù. Basically, it‚Äôs another satellite imaging company similar to BKSY, PL, etc‚Ä¶ Their pitch deck is pretty cool, and while I‚Äôm not familiar with this space, the side by side comparisons of imagery to the competition is pretty compelling. Coupled with the fact that $SATL equipment is a much smaller form factor and less expensive to produce, they seem to have a pretty solid competitive differentiation in the market.. You can view the investor prezo here: [https://investors.satellogic.com/static-files/d7100057-b799-4534-bd86-b0b3a3a1ea43](https://investors.satellogic.com/static-files/d7100057-b799-4534-bd86-b0b3a3a1ea43)

Why am I talking about $SATL? Well, it has an interesting set up for a potential squeeze. Why? Well, it‚Äôs the ideal convergence of:

**Low Float w/ Solid Insider Lockups + High Relative + Lazy Short Crowding + PRs Abound**

***Low Float w/ Solid Insider Lockups*** 

So all the furus on twitter love to talk about low-float de-spacs. Big whoop. Well, first, most of them never try to identify what the true float is. Let‚Äôs do that now.

‚Äã

https://preview.redd.it/ranvg48trzv81.jpg?width=992&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e1e04ea76911b207721315c1cf6ca901344a95e

At the time of merger, $SATL had 25m shares that IPO‚Äôd as part of the SPAC process. This is the public traded float pre-merger. However, at the time of the merger, $SATL had massive redemptions, to the tune of about 94%. 

‚Äã

https://preview.redd.it/699256nurzv81.jpg?width=1032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2029b05a9625d22be9abb496446cfc024935d82

So the math is 25,000,000 - 23,143,646 = 1,856,354

So total shares post-merger = 1.85m. That‚Äôs the tradable float. 

But the merger occurred back in January, surely there are a ton of shares (PIPE, insider, sponsor, etc‚Ä¶) unlocked now!

Well, that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre wrong!

Satellogic had some pretty solid lock-up provisions that applied to the majority of remaining shares. Let‚Äôs take a look.

‚Äã

https://preview.redd.it/omel6s9wrzv81.jpg?width=986&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b28f478cc1917de6d4125767116d77a612e02e47

‚Äã

https://preview.redd.it/998lidgxrzv81.jpg?width=898&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=273311d08c1863af03c6a15baaee423cbdc1e7cd

So the above conditions apply to the insiders (PubCo) and the sponsor (Cantor Fitzgerald). What about the PIPE? Great question, it doesn‚Äôt. However, a majority of the PIPE holders agreed to a lock up addendum in exchange for additional warrants. Of the \~4.5m PIPE shares, 2.5m are locked up (1 warrant per 1 PIPE share locked up)

‚Äã

https://preview.redd.it/ryq1iokyrzv81.jpg?width=1030&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e627693a9cfa20e590801df2d1392ca77270f48

So of the 4.65m shares issued to the PIPE, 2.5m elected to have theirs locked up (entitling them to some free warrants at an exercise price of $20) leaving 2.15m PIPE shares unlocked.

But here‚Äôs the wrinkle, the PIPE shares haven‚Äôt been effectively registered yet (note the BIG RED WORDS):

‚Äã

https://preview.redd.it/g02a10lzrzv81.jpg?width=1083&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46c14ac3efe4abfe4258ad23c3f5bd6f385a3786

As you may or may not know, the SEC has been dragging its feet when it comes to processing de-spac prospectus filings. As it stands right now, those 2.15m PIPE shares can‚Äôt be traded. The float remains at \~1.85m shares.

What else does $SALT have going for it? Well, there were also provisions in the prospectus that prevented insiders and PIPE from taking any effective short positions (selling short, via options, etc‚Ä¶)

‚Äã

https://preview.redd.it/ausuf8o2szv81.jpg?width=1032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ced1f3b8b4b6b29b6106a843c442352007783d0

***High Relative SI + Thin Trading***

The latest Exchange Reported SI came out today and it appears that $SATL has \*official\* SI of over 900k shares. However, that data is out of date the minute it's reported. If you take a look at Ortex, there has been additional lending during that time and we‚Äôre now approaching almost 1m shares sold short.

‚Äã

https://preview.redd.it/jma9yeu4szv81.png?width=1506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42074bd027d8366ef5fce9ba860b8a6f51c86810

So basically, around or over 50% of the tradable float is sold short. Further evidence of the situation for shorts is the rising CTB and dwindling shares available. While DTC isn‚Äôt really a good indicator of anything, it helps highlight liquidity, or the lack thereof. As you can see with SATL, it's a HUGE lack of liquidity. 40 days to cover, lol. The spread is commons is stupid wide and a handful of shares trade each day. If any shorts wanted to cover, it would likely be a parabolic move and very painful (for them).

‚Äã

https://preview.redd.it/vosh2vr9szv81.jpg?width=688&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37275f0ad14f1ff26594cd9bcd0fb3886cd5cdc9

***Lazy Short Crowding***

So now the story behind the story: lazy short positioning and overcrowding. I always like looking for similar plays to understand how they behaved. I‚Äôve been following a number of these plays and a few that come to mind are as follows:

1. EVTL
   1. Traded thin as fuck, until it didn‚Äôt and ripped 45%
2. BBAI
   1. Ongoing, but it‚Äôs had a wild ride from mid $5 range to mid teens, and everywhere in between
3. CELU
   1. Has casually drifted from $3 to upwards of $12 on zero social media chatter or news. 
4. SST
   1. Slow grind from $8 to $17, until it had a wild trading session where it tapped $37
5. BOXD
   1. Another casual from $8 to $12 on zero social media chatter either

So what do all of the tickers above have in common? 

* Recent de-spacs
* Substantial redemptions
* Decent insider lockups
* Minimal retail attention (until they popped)

I wanted to highlight the first bullet above, as I think it‚Äôs VERY important as to why all these plays are viable, and why I like $SATL. Everyone expects 99% of SPACs to dump from $10 NAV down to a few bucks. It‚Äôs inevitable for most of them. 

It had been EASY MONEY for shorts to just pile in after the merger vote and wait it out as gravity took over. However, a couple months ago, the SEC decided to review how they deal with SPACs and their processing time for filing statements ground to a halt (pretty much).

So essentially, shorts piled into a relatively thinly traded float, with the expectation that a flood of insider shares would be available soon enough and they could cover at massively depressed prices. Only, that didn‚Äôt happen. WHOOPS. Instead, all of these de-spacs have floated/ground higher into increasing CTB. 

***Lots of PR To Trigger A Boom***

Now given the minimal chatter I‚Äôve seen regarding $SATL on twitter and elsewhere, you‚Äôd think the company had no PR team. However, you couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth, as the company has been VERY busy releasing positive PR to help reinforce the brand:

1. April 4th:

4. It‚Äôs almost as if they‚Äôre ramping up PR to build up to some sort of crescendo‚Ä¶hmmm. I mean, just take a look at all of their recent press releases:
   1. https://satellogic.com/news/press-room/

Oh yeah, and $SATL has been busy since their SPAC merger. Let's take a look:

‚Äã

https://preview.redd.it/fodvlmsftzv81.jpg?width=1441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2176b86cbb99c0e7ddd9f013bf903c66836276ed

Hmm, among other things, they added some well connected folks with meaningful relationships with various areas of the federal government. Not like that would bear fruit in the near future or anything...

***So, Let‚Äôs Recap***

* $SATL is a cutting edge technology company with an incredibly relevant product/service for today‚Äôs macro environment.
* Insiders who have agreed to very solid lockup terms
* The few shares that are not subject to lockup haven‚Äôt even been registered yet, and even once registered, it‚Äôs a relative small amount of shares held by insiders who aren‚Äôt necessarily incentivized to dump
* As a result, a \*VERY\* thinly traded free float with daily volume less than 31k
* High SI % of FF, close to 50% based on redemptions and locked up shares, resulting in a comical \~40 DTC for short positions
* Lots of current and upcoming PR potential to launch this thing into orbit 

[heh](https://preview.redd.it/xn82cb2vtzv81.png?width=636&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d66692fb53cb8fc5b82897819c31b372c23d7c6e)

**Tl;dr $SATL presents a nice (potentially explosive) set up in order to squeeze shorts who joined a crowded trade that has slowly turned against them over time.**

Company Profile
Iconic Brands Inc is a United States-based company engaged in the development, marketing and distribution of celebrity-branded alcohol beverages. Its activities include the development and completion of product idea, sourcing, flavor profiles, packaging, design, marketing, and distribution. The company's product portfolio comprises of Bellissima Prosecco; Bella Sprizz Apertifs; BiVi Vodka and Hooters Spirits

Main Revenue Driver 
Iconic Brands acquired TopPop Packaging in 2021. 

TopPop Packaging is a premier contract manufacturing and packaging company, specializing in single use flexible packaging applications in the food beverage, and health categories.


Why this matters 

Iconic Brands, and their CEO Larry Romer (Former Jim Beam VP, southern wine and spirits VP, and Coca Cola senior management) thinks that Ready to Drink (think Margaritas/Shots/etc. to go) and Ready to Freeze (popsicles) alcoholic beverages are the best big thing in the alcohol industry, as its the next natural progression of the beverage industry after seltzers made their big debuts in 2020/2021. Top Pop's biggest customer is Anhueser-Busch, in which TopPop packages their Bud Light Seltzer Ice Popsicles, which are sure to be a hit in summer of 2022. This is just a glimpse at the wide array of packaging products TopPop does, and they're currently running their two facilities at max capacity 24/7 to keep up with demand. Their annual report should be released soon, in which we can expect record breaking revenues from Iconic Brands. 

Third Quarter 2021 Financial Highlights

    Total revenue of $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $2.1 million or approximately 300% year-over-year, compared to $712,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2020.

    Gross profit was $695,000, an increase of 57% year-over-year as compared to gross profit for the same period in 2020.

 AppTech Payments (APCX) Has the Patented Technology That Could Disrupt  the Fintech Sector and All Financial Enterprises Can Seamlessly Slide In  
 

‚Äú**APCX has created the only single platform that does both sides of the banking and merchant processing in the world.‚Äù**   
 

‚Äú**MasterCard and VISA have signed on and are fully integrated in‚Äù**  
 

Good day everyone,  
 

**AppTech Payments Corp. (NASDAQ: APCX),** is a Fintech company offering and developing a platform for B2B, B2C and P2P capabilities in payments.  
 

Current price $1.73/share (as of 10:00 am EDT 4-25-22)  
 

After an open at $1.86/share and an early high of $1.88 APCX shares have  had a slow, but steady early morning start today. The equities markets  are tentative this morning however, we could see a bounce soon as they  reach oversold conditions.  
 

The real value in APCX lies in their patented technology. Fintech has  changed the way we transact business; it‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve seen  the inside of a bank and I only keep a small amount of cash on hand.  Electronic transactions available to us with fintech 1.0 make our lives  simpler and expands our realm of choices, but the system comes with many  frustrations like:  
 

The vendor doesn‚Äôt accept your payment method.  
 Hackers constantly invading fintech platforms.  
 Spending time filling in forms with your card information.  
 Needing an encyclopedia of your usernames and passwords.  
 

**So, what exactly is APCX doing to disrupt fintech?**  
 

As I said earlier, the company has four patents that cover any invoicing  or sale between a computer and computer, a computer and cellphone, and  cellphone and a cellphone. MasterCard and VISA have signed on and are  fully integrated in.  
 

Frankly, we are ready for fintech 2.0 and that is where APCX comes in.  Today, merchants and banks operate through a ""middleman"" to accomplish  transactions and APCX technology will eliminate that third party. **APCX has created the only single platform that does both sides of the banking and merchant processing in the world.**   
 

Stay tuned for my full report on APCX.

Their **FOUR** Patents Could Bring Big Tech To Its Knees ‚Äì Taking Over The $2.5 TRILLION Global Digital Payment Market. And That‚Äôs Not All‚Ä¶

Good Morning,

**5 Reasons we Think AppTech Payments Corp. (NASDAQ: APCX) Could Quickly Become the Next Fintech Giant**

1. Consumers, especially GenZ, are frustrated with high friction payment systems and poor digital shopping experiences.
2. Traditional payment systems were built long ago and were not built to scale for online and phone payments.
3. AppTech Payments Corp. has the ONLY seamless digital payment system that integrates banking and merchant functions for frictionless transactions.
4. MasterCard and VISA have signed on and are fully integrated in.
5. The company has four patents that cover any invoicing or sale between a computer and computer, a computer and cellphone, and cellphone and a cellphone.

**Current price $1.85/share**

We all know how strong the fintech sector is, those service fees for every asset transaction are an irresistible lure for many companies and it seems like everyone wants in. Fintech technology is especially strong with a projected CAGR of 20% over the next six years.

I wanted to find a company that operated a fintech platform that was also developing new fintech technology. I looked for a small cap company listed on the NASDAQ, keeping in mind the parameters our members gravitate to, and I came across Apptech. APCX uplisted to the NASDAQ on January 7, 2022, with a $13M capital raise and with the changes happening right now at the company, I expect 2022 to be a breakout year for this company. Currently flying under the radar with near-term potential as well.

APCX has a strong cash position, new blood in their management team, and an appetite for expansion and growth. The bigger players in the fintech sector reflect some lofty market values but I think APCX is just beginning its journey and still offers value for our group.

Luke D‚ÄôAngelo, CEO of AppTech commented: ""we look forward to forming additional partnerships with strong organizations to support integrations of digital banking and business payment acceptances.‚Äù

**APCX statistics:**

Outstanding shares ‚Äì 16.3MFloat ‚Äì 7.5M sharesInsider ownership ‚Äì 33.6%Market Cap - $30MYTD high - $3.15/share

At the beginning of this year, the company closed a public offering, in conjunction with a new NASDAQ listing, of 3,614,458 units, each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock, at a public offering price of $4.15 per unit, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $13.0 million. The warrants are exercisable at $5.1875/share for five years.

The $13M capital raise, done in conjunction with the company‚Äôs NASDAQ uplist, gives APCX the flexibility to develop the IP necessary to compete in the fintech sector as well as develop SaaS technology to promote within the fintech sector. I‚Äôm excited about the future for the APCX digital/mobile platform for PaaS and BaaS but **I am more excited about the patented IP portfolio they are building (read below) as that may be the aspect of this company that is irresistible to a bigger fish.**

At the beginning of this year APCX welcomed Nicholas Nolasco and Scott Carnley as members of the company‚Äôs senior technical leadership team. Nicolas will be AppTech‚Äôs Chief Architect responsible for setting the technical strategy and direction of AppTech‚Äôs fintech platform. Scott will be AppTech‚Äôs Director of Engineering, leading the day-to-day management of AppTech‚Äôs Engineering team.

**Recent developments at APCX:**

Julia brings to AppTech over 20 years of finance, accounting, compliance, and SEC reporting experience from various publicly traded companies. Ms. Yu is a Certified Public Accountant, Certified Internal Auditor, Chartered Global Management Accountant, and has MBAs from Webster University and Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.

Last month [Howard Fish joined the APCX team](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apptech-payments-corp-welcomes-howard-100000398.html) as the Director of Sales and Business Development. Howard joins AppTech from i3 Verticals where he served as the Director of Integrated Payments. Howard brings over 30+ years of financial services, banking and integrated payments sales, leadership, and management success to the company. He will be charged to build out and lead the structure of AppTech‚Äôs platform sales organization and global business development efforts in both mature and emerging markets.

**Recent company accomplishments:**

Developed key system functions, including CI/CD pipelines, go-forward scalable and secure AWS infrastructure, POC for Text2Pay Invoice System, and POC for Crypto Payments Invoice System.

Researched, identified, and vetted partnership with digital asset platform partners for blockchain and cryptocurrency use cases.

Co-developed end-to-end, automated product and opportunity intake process to streamline, categorize and prioritize new products/features and business development opportunities.

FYE 2021 results announced March 31st ([the APCX 10-K is available here](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1070050/000157570522000237/apcx_10k.htm)):

4Q21 revenues were $95,136, a 3.0% increase versus 3Q21, driven by larger processing volumes.

Fiscal year 2021 revenues were $353,824, a 7% increase versus Fiscal Year 2020, driven primarily by the addition of new accounts.

Cash balance as of December 31, 2021, was $8,026, however, a public offering closed on January 7, 2022, netting the Company $13.4 million.

APCX shares have been trending over the past month, pushing past their SMA20 of $1.60 and their SMA50 of $1.44/share. I expect the company shares could gain to their YTD high of $3.15/share and beyond.

However, what I'm curious to know is where are you seeing green right now?

Do you guys have any leading hedging strategies? Or do you have undervalued buy opportunities in your sights/portfolios that you want to buy at a bargain?

IMO I expect metals to continue to perform well in the current market just judging by overall sector performance in the last 24-36 months. Penny stock wise, this is one of the best opportunities I'm staring at rn:

**Altiplano Metals ($ALTPF)**

* Altiplano is a battle-tested copper-gold play that has demonstrated a steady path to growth backed by consistent improvements to its mining and business operations. In their latest quarter, they sold 281,949 pounds of copper, generating a record of approximately US$857,238 in revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

**American Battery Technology ($ABML)**

* For sure a carrousel on acid in the short-term, but long-term-wise, I like it. ABML has been upgrading its ops by scooping up talent from TSLA, has increased its supply footprint, and might play a bigger role in the domestic supply chain due to the Russian conundrum."|0.89|26|0|26

**Potential Catalyst:** ‚ÄúThunderous, the debut graphic  novel leading the franchise intellectual property (IP) brand of the same  name, will hit bookshelves everywhere beginning Thursday, April 26‚Äù

**Potential Catlayst:** All-Star, well connected team of  board members and recent additions Russell Hicks, Melanie Bartlett,  Richard Manville, Maz Jabroni, and M.L. Smoker, may energize the revenue  streams for the company in FYE 2022

Good day everyone,

**Grom Social Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: GROM)** the social media company providing secure social media just for children under thirteen.

Current price **$.87/share** (at market close 4-20-22)

GROM has consolidated, I think there is a real opportunity for a near  term gain here. GROM did very well for our members with our last report  and I anticipate a repeat near term.

**Some factors that indicate GROM shares are way oversold:**

Outstanding shares 12.6M**Public float 8.75M**Market cap - $10.7M**Total assets $37.8M**Cash (mrq) 6.5M**Book value - $2.07/share**Revenue (FYE 12-31-21) - $6.29MTrading 95% off 52-week highs

Last week, Grom released their 10-K for the Fiscal year end 12-31-21 (a copy is available on the [company website](https://gromsocial.com/investors/financials.php)).  While FYE 2021 revenues remained flat as compared to FYE 2020, I expect  recent partner additions to the GROM team like Russell Hicks, Melanie  Bartlett, Richard Manville, Maz Jabroni, and M.L. Smoker, may energize  the revenue streams for the company in FYE 2022. **To me, the most significant takeaway is the company‚Äôs book value of $2.07/share, showing how ridiculously oversold this is.**

Let‚Äôs examine the subsidiaries of GROM (below) to further emphasize the  diversity of verticals they are developing. The company has placed a lot  of emphasis on its Grom Social subsidiary which presents with several  potential revenue streams. **Internetmatters.org, a children‚Äôs  Internet watchdog group, has listed Grom Social as one of the top five  best Internet destinations for children.**

**Recent company news:**

**Thunderous**, [the debut graphic novel](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/groms-curiosity-ink-media-kicks-120000363.html)  leading the franchise intellectual property (IP) brand of the same  name, will hit bookshelves everywhere beginning Thursday, April 26.  Graphic novels, like comic books, use sequential art to tell a story.  Curiosity Ink Media, the GROM subsidiary, noted the graphic novel is the  first publishing title to be released from Curiosity's previously  announced collaboration with Dynamite Entertainment, to develop and  publish a slate of printed content rooted in the Curiosity's original  IP.

Written by Montana Poet Laureate, M.L. Smoker and Natalie Peeterse and  illustrated by Dale Deforest, Thunderous follows the unexpected  adventures of a Native American teen's journey into a magical world  where new friends and foes are discovered. The novel for young readers  serves as a launching point for future publishing opportunities as well  as potential brand extensions from Curiosity, including a recurring TV  series, feature film and consumer products. Thunderous will be available  wherever books are sold.

I want to look more closely at the GROM subsidiaries as I believe the  true value of the company lies in the diversity of its developing  verticals.

**Grom Social, Inc.** ‚Äì **Revenue streams include:** Advertising, Subscription Based Premium Content, Online Game Fees, Licensing Merchandise, Publishing and Distribution.Based on data provided by Google Data Analytics and Joomla Management  Systems, in February 2021, GROM platforms have generated approximately  25.0 million users in over two hundred countries and territories since  their inception. **As of March 1, 2022, there were approximately 1.8 million Monthly Average Users on all GROM platforms.**

**What can children do on the Grom Social Mobile App?**

Record videos of themselves to post in a social environment and use enhanced facial features, masks, filters and more.

**Upload videos that are COPPA compliant.**

View 1,450 hours of exclusive Grom TV content and a video on demand  platform for kids which is free and curated to provide only safe and  educational content for children.

Communicate with cartoon characters and cast members.

Communicate with users and parents regardless of where they may be  navigating on the Grom Social website. This feature eliminates the need  to leave the section of the site in which they are engaged.

**TD Holdings Limited** ‚Äì Currently the top revenue  generator for GROM. This company contracts with third parties to produce  animated films and televisions series, employing four hundred artists.  They provide services to high-profile properties, including Tom and  Jerry, My Little Pony and Disney Animation‚Äôs Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero.  Its studio produces over two hundred half-hour segments of animated  content for television annually, which makes it one of the top producers  of animation for television worldwide.

**Grom Educational Services, Inc.** \- Sells hardware and/or  subscriptions for web filtering software to thousands of schools with  more than four million children in attendance. Clients pay for hardware  within 30 days of delivery and in advance for filtering service ranging  between one to five years.

**Curiosity Ink Media LLC.** ‚Äì Acquired in August 2021  (80%). This subsidiary is headed by Russell Hicks, formerly President of  Nickelodeon Animation Studios, Russell Hicks has masterminded countless  iconic franchises like Scooby-Doo, SpongeBob, and Dora the Explorer.  Curiosity is a kids and family original content and media company that  focuses on building and managing entertainment brands and franchises.  Curiosity leverages its creative talent, established media distribution  networks, and industry connections to market proven media properties  through strategic licensing agreements, partnerships, and original  content creation.

1/13/2022 UBS Group Initiated Coverage with a Buy Rating

GROM shares have fallen below all their Simple Moving Averages and the  current RSI (14) is an exceptionally low 38.28. This data can be a clear  indicator that the shares are oversold. Note the spike to $1.67/share  on March 18th, and the double bottom that has formed since.

https://preview.redd.it/t56ujq5d6su81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa619c04aebbb3f54d7c210ad66394c0a8978d7a

Conclusion: GROM could easily reach it's book value of $2.07/share and beyond in the near term for over 100% in gains.

Float secretly remains tiny for coming weeks.|"$ARQQ got a bit of attention yesterday from the WSB crowd on a post hyping a gamma squeeze potential there. But they missed something that makes this play even better short term: a miscalculated float that is much smaller than you will see at any data aggregator. The company itself is a speculative, though interesting long idea in the new quantum computing space. 

**THE FLOAT IS MUCH SMALLER THAN YOU THINK:**

The WSB DD mentioned that there isn‚Äôt a lock up in play, which was the plan according to the original prospectus. But, the tendie gods at ARQQ HQ [slipped us a little something back in October](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001859690/000110465921122323/tm2127896d4_6k.htm) that totally changed the game:

&gt;*On October 4, 2021, the Sponsor, the Arqit Limited Shareholders and their transferees, agreed to amend and restate the Original Lock-Up Agreements, and have agreed not to transfer any ordinary shares of the Company received pursuant to the Business Combination during the period commencing from the date of the closing of the Business Combination until the earlier to occur of (i) 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the close of trading on the second full trading day following the public dissemination by the Company of its financial results for the six months ended March 31, 2022 by press release to the national wire services or by making a filing with the SEC; and (ii) such time as determined by the board of directors of the Company as being in the best interest of the parties to permit transfers (the ‚ÄúNew Lock-Up Agreements‚Äù).*

They extended the lockup agreement until the results through March 31 2022 are **released**. We don‚Äôt know when that might be yet. But, if history is any indicator, it was December 16 2021 that they released their results for the period ending Sept 30 2021. **We‚Äôre still under lockup and will be for at least the next few weeks.**

**What does that mean for the float?**

Shit son, I‚Äôm glad you asked. It turns out that this De-SPAC hasn‚Äôt had shit for volume because there aren‚Äôt many shares available for public trading. Let‚Äôs break it down:

Currently there are 120,073,430 shares outstanding. That is 110,073,430 as of the last filing + a note indicated in subsequent events that another 10,000,000 were issued as part of the earn out agreement for the merger. That sounds like a lot‚Ä¶ but it isn‚Äôt shit today when we pull away everything locked up.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yoji7qusmit81.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87d0af0ff85e906d6fd4de46f2dc1548ca7ef9f2

First, let‚Äôs cover the 10 million earn out shares issued after [this last prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001859690/000110465921125321/tm2127896-6_424b3.htm):

&gt;***Issuance of Earnout Shares***  
*Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination, if at any time during the three years following the closing of the Business Combination, the closing price of the Company‚Äôs ordinary shares during such period was equal to or exceeded $12.50 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days during a 30 consecutive trading day period (the ‚ÄúEarnout Condition‚Äù), the Arqit Limited Shareholders were entitled to be issued a further 10,000,000 ordinary shares of the Company (the ‚ÄúEarnout Shares‚Äù). On October 5, 2021 the Earnout Condition was met, and therefore on October 6, 2021, the Earnout Shares were issued to the Arqit Limited Shareholders.* ***The Earnout Shares are subject to the Amended and Restated Lock-Up Agreements.***

**Done. 10,000,000 gone. 110,073,430 to go.**

Next, who is subject to the lock up that was extended:

&gt;***Amended and Restated Lock-Up Agreements***  
*In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company entered into lock-up agreements* ***with Centricus Heritage, LLC (the ‚ÄúSponsor‚Äù) and the former shareholders of Arqit Limited (the ‚ÄúArqit Limited Shareholders‚Äù) (the ‚ÄúOriginal Lock-Up Agreements‚Äù).***  
*Pursuant to the Original Lock-Up Agreements, the Sponsor and the Arqit Limited Shareholders had agreed not to transfer any ordinary shares of the Company received pursuant to the Business Combination during the period commencing from the date of the closing of the Business Combination until the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which the closing price of the Company‚Äôs ordinary shares during such period exceeded $12.50 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days during a 30 consecutive trading day period and (ii) 18 months after the closing of the Business Combination.*  
*On October 4, 2021, the Sponsor, the Arqit Limited Shareholders and their transferees, agreed to amend and restate the Original Lock-Up Agreements, and agreed not to transfer any ordinary shares of the Company received pursuant to the Business Combination during the period commencing from the date of the closing of the Business Combination until the earlier to occur of (i) 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the close of trading on the second full trading day following the public dissemination by the Company of its financial results for the six months ended March 31, 2022; and (ii) such time as determined by the board of directors of the Company as being in the best interest of the parties to permit transfers (the ‚ÄúAmended and Restated Lock-Up Agreements‚Äù).*  
***In addition to the Sponsor and the Arqit Limited Shareholders, Heritage Assets SCSP entered into an Amended and Restated Lock-Up Agreement with respect to 1,825,096 shares assigned to it by the Arqit Limited Shareholders at the time of the closing of the Business Combination, which were previously subject to an Original Lock-Up Agreement.***

So we‚Äôve got *Centricus Heritage LLC* locked up. Go up to the share count table above and that‚Äôs the *Centricus Initial Shareholders.* **They‚Äôve got 8,625,000 shares and they can‚Äôt sell a goddam one of them right now.**

Next is on the agreement is *Arqit Limited Shareholders,* who holds...where is it again‚Ä¶ **88,174,904 more shares that are off limits. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF**

Then we‚Äôve also got this little guy at the bottom *Heritage Assets SC.* **Their 1,825,096 shares are also subject to the revised lockup.**

Quick tally on where we stand so far:

**110,073,430** subtotal after the earn out shares are removed

**Less:**

**8,625,000** from Centricus initial shareholders

**88,174,904** from the Arquit limited shareholders

**1,825,096** from Heritage Asset SCSP

Remain float shares: **11,448,430**

At 11.4 million things are looking a little spicier. If it weren‚Äôt for those 7.1 million PIPE shares, we would be in low float nirvana. But I didn‚Äôt read 2,000 pages of SEC filings to leave you hanging with some ‚Äòif only‚Äô bullshit. **Who are the PIPE investors?**

&gt;***PIPE Subscription Agreements***  
*Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, Centricus and Arqit entered into the Subscription Agreements with the PIPE Investors, pursuant to which the PIPE Investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and Arqit agreed to issue and sell to such PIPE Investors, an aggregate of 7,100,000 ordinary shares at $10.00 per share for gross proceeds of $71,000,000 immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination. The PIPE Investors include Garth Ritchie, a current director of Centricus and who became a director of Arqit upon completion of the Business Combination, and Cristina Levis, an executive officer of Centricus, each of whom invested $500,000 in the PIPE Financing. The PIPE Investors also include Heritage Assets SCSP, which invested $50,000,000 in the PIPE Financing. Mr. Lefebvre d‚ÄôOvidio has sole investment and voting power over the shares held by Heritage Assets SCSP and is a director of Centricus and became a director of Arqit upon completion of the Business Combination. Arqit has granted the PIPE Investors certain registration rights in connection with the PIPE Financing.*

Remember that it isn‚Äôt just locked up shares that get pulled from the float. We also remove those owned by board members and other insiders. **5.1 million of the 7.1 million PIPE shares are owned by current directors of Arquit and are not part of the publically trading float.**

**11,448,430 from above less 5,100,000 PIPE shares leaves: 6,348,430 floating shares.**

Nice.

Don‚Äôt forget about our buddy Mr. Lefebvre d‚ÄôOvidio from the PIPE above. It turns out we see his name again further down the filing for another tranche of shares.

&gt;***Business combination agreement***  
*On May 12, 2021, Centricus Acquisition Corp. (‚ÄúCentricus‚Äù/ ‚ÄúCAC‚Äù), Arqit Limited (‚ÄúAL‚Äù), and the shareholders of AL entered into a Business Combination Agreement whereby: (i) on September 2, 2021, Centricus merged with and into Arqit Quantum Inc (‚Äúthe Company‚Äù / ‚ÄúAQI‚Äù), with the Company surviving the merger, and the security holders of Centricus became security holders of the Company, and (ii) on September 3, 2021, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding share capital of AL from the shareholders of AL in exchange for ordinary shares of the Company, such that AL is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.*  
*In consideration for the merger between the Company and Centricus, each Centricus shareholder received one ordinary share and one warrant of the Company for each ordinary share and warrant they held in Centricus, respectively. Each ordinary share of AL was acquired by the Company in exchange for 46.06 ordinary shares of AQI.*  
***Prior to the merger of the Company with Centricus, Heritage Assets SCSp purchased 2,200,000 Class A Ordinary Shares of Centricus in open-market transactions for a cash consideration of $22,000,000 and, as an incentive to Heritage Assets SCSp for such purchase, Centricus and certain shareholders of AL transferred to Heritage Assets SCSp an aggregate of 1,825,096 Ordinary Shares in the Company as part of the recapitalisation.***

It turns out his 1,825,096 shares from the very first section were given to him because he saved the SPAC deal when too many shareholders tried to redeem their shares for NAV. He bought 2,200,000 of the Centricus public shares and pledged not to redeem them in exchange for a big fucking freebie of another 1.8 million shares. Great deal for Mr. Lefebvre d‚ÄôOvidio, but great deal for apes too. 2.2 million of the 4.34 million publically trading shares are removed from the float since they are owned by an entity controlled by a current board member.

Where does that leave us: **4,148,430 public float on ARQQ**

&amp;#x200B;

With a float of just over 4.1 million and much more open interest on the April and May options contracts, go back and re-read the original gamma squeeze DD with this new information. Fucking beautiful, isn‚Äôt it?

Better still: This new float number changes the context of a short squeeze dramatically. Take a look at the most recent exchange reported data and today‚Äôs Ortex estimated data:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/insdqedwmit81.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=792e71bf2012a2c8b59079934cb1c63128cc4426

**Now with a short interest of 1.6 million shares we are looking at a short interest of nearly 40% of the float and a CTB of 200%. This squeeze is dual threat. Shorts are fukked. Market makers are fukked.**

Why does every other data collector and aggregator out there show a much higher float of over 20 million and a crayon eater on Reddit has to dig this out of a fucking file box worth of filing documents?

Float is not an ‚Äòofficially‚Äô tracked metric. It generally defined as the share count available to openly trade in the public. But search in any company‚Äôs SEC filings and you won‚Äôt find a reported float number or breakdown of how they get to that number.

We rely on companies like S3, Ortex, Capital IQ and others to do their own due diligence to make sure they are counting shares correctly as floating, or not floating. Unfortunately, without regulation on the matter, most of them are using scraping and algorithms on the text in filings to try to back out the non-floating shares and then minimal human intervention supervises the results and calls it good.

As you can see from our above analysis to arrive at the true float, no algo today would be able to piece all of this together on its own. The 1,000+ pages of filings needed to do it manually are much more than those companies are going to pay an analyst to beat their face against for a week. They aren‚Äôt nearly as retarded as a desperate WSB shill. I digress.

**Warrants:**

These little shits always pop up and dilute at the worst possible time when a despac is making a run.

We‚Äôve got private warrants and public warrants with ARQQ. The first step is easy. There are 6,266,667 private placement warrants outstanding and they are all owned by Centricus Heritage LLC, the sponsor of the deal:

&gt;*Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 6,266,667 warrants (the ‚ÄúPrivate Placement Warrants‚Äù) at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Centricus Heritage LLC (the ‚ÄúSponsor‚Äù), generating gross proceeds of $9,400,000, which is described in Note 4.*

They are part of the lock up agreement. They are insiders. **They are not float if/when they are redeemed.**

Then we‚Äôve got public warrants. There are 8.6 million of these floating. Those might seem like an imminent dilution bomb. But it might not be as dire as it seems.

***This section more rooted in my personal opinion than hard facts as we cannot know for certain when or how the warrants might be exercised. I present my own argument. Draw your own conclusions.***

The warrants offer a right to buy one share of common stock at $11.50 per share. As I write this, the warrants last traded at $3.96 per share. To buy a warrant today and redeem it would cost you $15.46 per share. With the underlying common shares at $14.57, you can see how warrants redemptions are not a quick flip investment in most cases. It can also be capital intensive compared to other shorter duration derivatives like call options and the liquidity of the public options can be spotty if you want to trade them actively. So how do I foresee these options converting if many won‚Äôt be explicitly exercised by traders in the near term? And when might it happen?

I believe the company will take care of that for us with a forced redemption. **And better still, it won‚Äôt be in the immediate future and it could be for far fewer shares than 8.1 million.**

A provision in the warrants allows the company to ‚Äòforce‚Äô the redemption of the warrants under the following conditions:

&gt;¬∑ *Upon minimum of 30 days‚Äô prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and*  
¬∑ *If, and only if, the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three trading days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.*

That helps us answer when. The share price will have to be over $18 for at least 20 trading days **THEN** a 30 notice of redemption is sent **THEN** the warrants will be redeemed. **The important part: A forced redemption is at minimum two months away.**

The redemption can be done one of two ways: cash or cashless. The company has reserved the right to opt for either in the warrant agreements. What is the difference?

**In a cash redemption:** the warrant holder sends ARQQ $11.50 in cash and in turn receives one share of stock. Pretty straight forward.

**In a cashless redemption:** the middleman cash transaction is cut out and instead the company transfers the warrant holder a fraction of a share of stock equal to the profit they would have had in a cash transaction. To calculate this fractional share, they use a complex options pricing calculation assuming volatility and time until the warrant expired. For ARQQ that redemption table looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zqnsdnxxmit81.png?width=681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b409c2d6b58cfd656e8bd62415c7e56b95e4dfa

0.361 shares per warrant is the maximum share issuance in a cashless redemption. If ARQQ meets the requirements to redeem all of the warrants, I believe they will choose to do so in the more shareholder friendly cashless basis. Why?

* They have stated that the cash received from their IPO is more than enough to fund the product development and business plan
* Without a need for cash, the company can reduce dilution by redeeming warrants for fractional shares
* The company just recently went post revenue and with a large sales pipeline, should reduce their cash burn rate quickly

It is impossible to know what warrant holders will choose to do with organically requesting redemption or what management will choose to do if given the opportunity to redeem all warrants. But there is a window of opportunity for fractional redemptions that could reduce the 8.1 million outstanding public warrants to less than 4 million shares of dilution. To top it off, it would be far enough away that the lockup period has likely past and the squeeze has already squozen.

**The company is an interesting long even without a squeeze:**

I‚Äôve already blown up the scroll bar hard enough, so I‚Äôll save you some time here and keep it shortish:

Quantum computers are coming and they could quickly become extremely powerful. The brute force of quantum computers could quickly overwhelm existing algorithms and technology for generating hashing and encryption. ARQQ offers a product aimed at ‚Äòquantum-proofing‚Äô hashing and other security sensitive ‚Äòbrute forceable‚Äô infrastructure.

You can get a more technical sense of the problems the company is working to solve in their own words [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001859690/000110465921093381/tm2122531d1_425.htm). It is all abstract and a bit of a stretch for me to fully grasp what they are doing and I consider myself relatively technically literate. Some numbers that turned me on to ARQQ as a possible long despite this futuristic new product are in their early sales numbers:

&gt;*As of September 30, 2021, Arqit‚Äôs backlog estimates consisted of approximately $130 million in customer contracts, and Arqit had an estimated $1.1 billion in pipeline.*

That $130 million in contracts from the likes of the USAF and Virgin Orbit is a figure now more than 6 months old and has very likely grown. It was also driven by a sales staff of just two (one dedicated sales person and the CEO). The company has indicated that the proceeds of its IPO will help it not only deliver its products to market, but to build up the sales and marketing muscle to dominate this new space.

The company just went post revenue in just the last days of their last reporting period, which is why you see a paltry 5-figure revenue for that period. With the next earnings release coming likely in May, we will be able to get a much clearer idea of the pace at which ARQQ will be able to beef up that sales pipeline and convert it in to revenue. It is highly speculative. But at a $1.6 billion valuation today, you might think about holding on to some of this one. Even if there is a gamma/short squeeze scenario in the coming weeks.

**TLDR; There was a DD** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u2r8uu/arqq_ultimate_gamma_squeeze_with_massive_oi_and/)**. It‚Äôs pretty awesome, right? But the float on ARQQ is actually tiny compared to published data.**

**Short % of float could be in the range of 40% based on this new float number. With a CTB of 200%+ on Ortex and 160%+ on iBorrow, this would be the #1 short squeeze on retail‚Äôs radar if it wasn‚Äôt for cucks at the data aggregators being lazy assholes that publish incorrect data.**

**It‚Äôs actually a pretty fucking cool company with a robust sales pipeline. Keep them on your watchlist, even if you don‚Äôt want to get degen on the squeeze.**

My position includes commons and May $15c

This AMA saw our fave self-proclaimed RegTech friends @ Banxa speaking with one of their most exciting partners, Loopring and answering various questions from anyone who was interested.

&amp;#x200B;

**Who or what is a Loopring?**

Well, they build infrastructure, user products, and protocols for the DeFi space on the Ethereum blockchain (specifically Layer 2). According the Loopring, they state users need not to choose between security and performance. Their platform is low-fee, high-speed, all for trading, liquidity providing, swapping, and payments. In short, Loopring is designing and actively building the best zkRollup exchange and payment protocol on the ETH blockchain and democratizing this.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok cool, but who cares? I am an equities (specifically small-cap investor)...

&amp;#x200B;

**No, but for real, who cares?**

Well my friend, $BNXA has Loopring as one of their partners in their stable. And in my humble opinion, a very exciting partner! As $BNXA continues to grow, it seeks all avenues of growth and not just partner additions. Additionally, $BNXA is partnering with the likes of Loopring for the things they are doing internally and the offering it opens up for $BNXA to penetrate new markets and reach even more users.

&amp;#x200B;

**AMA takeaways:**

&gt;\- April 11, 2022 starts a 0% fee promotion with Loopring for two weeks  
&gt;  
&gt;\- No cap on the amount that can be deposited on Loopring via $BNXA  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Some exciting NFT based projects around the corner for Loopring  
&gt;  
&gt;\- BNXA on ramps an incredible amount of users and Loopring is a huge part  
&gt;  
&gt;\- 130+ countries and over 50+ supported  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Regulations (from $BNXA POV) are positive to an extent. Provides certainty and trust for projects (for the average and new users). This will facilitate mass adoption  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Needs to be a safe bridge from traditional fiat to digital currencies backed by regulation  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Banxa views themselves as essential to educating and onboarding new users safely  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Crypto in inevitable one way or the other  
&gt;  
&gt;\- DeFi protocols have and continue to gain many everyday use cases (the goal is the future of an individual being ""their own bank"")  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Banxa is just launching brand new Fiat to NFT (L1 and L2 blockchains) allowing NFT purchases using different payment methods, chargeback and fraud protection, no KYC required up to certain values (not much else was said about this)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Off-ramp with Loopring is on the roadmap and will be coming

KOSS is a stonk in the theoriezed ""Meme basket"", a group of stocks put together in derivative swap trades that allow shorters to short those stocks without trading via total return swaps. The stocks seem to be GME, AMC, KOSS and BBBY (BB and Nok with smaller correlation).  

The latter names aren't popular with retail and aren't meme-y so there is obviously more to the story than "" meme stocks "" its likely a derivative packaging up companies Wallstreet expected to fail in 2020.

Pros:

-Tracks Gamestop closer than AMC BB NOK and maybe BBBY

-KOSS has the lowest float of the basket stocks. 9 million shares outstanding 

-Has the lowest share price of the basket stocks highly correlated with GME. 

-The executives appear to be with the shits, they have not diluted the stock in spite of the share price running up over 2k%! Its actually pretty incredible. 

Cons:

-No options, don't expect much help from WSB

-The company is doing worse these days in sales and from supply chain issues. Yeah yeah I know ""who cares about fundamentals in a squeeze play? "" but it might compell them to dilute on the next runup. 

- 12% institutional ownership. At these prices lots of paperhands/long term institutions have already taken profit. Don't expect much more institutional ownership for confirmation bias but this is a good thing. Less people who can rugpull. 

-The execs DID cash out their own shares from the Jan 2021 spike. Idk how much they have left but it shows they not above it.

ELYS is a growing online gaming company with B2B platforms as their primary business and the company has shown steady growth year YOY since 2018 but their growth in 2021 looks like its their biggest revenue gain in recent years. As I‚Äôm writing this, and as you will read below, the company revenues are running slightly behind their market cap creating a price to sales ratio of only 1.20X.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion and based on my due diligence, ELYS value could double and could still look like a value. The company is growing, is a leader in online gaming technology and that sector is on fire with a 17.34% CAGR ahead of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, ELYS gave investors a heads up on data from its forthcoming FYE ended December 31, 2021 earnings report and 10-K filing. The big news is a 22% increase in revenues over FYE2020 to $45.5M. Additionally, the company expects web-based gross gaming revenue to increase by approximately 74% to approximately $54.9 million for FYE2021, compared to approximately $31.6 million for FYE2020.

&amp;#x200B;

These figures represent a big leap forward as the company expands geographically into North America. It was just 3 weeks ago that the company announced that Gaming Laboratories International, LLC (""GLI"") granted certification for the Product Development and Change Management Policies and Procedures on the Elys Gameboard sports wagering technology for Washington DC‚Äôs Gaming Control Board. GLI provides the gaming industry‚Äôs leading testing and certification services. They are the gold standard for certification in the online gaming industry.

&amp;#x200B;

The GLI certification is a big step as ELYS begins to expand its North American operations. The company is already a prominent player in the European online and land-based gaming market. While the company has already been operating on a limited basis in the U.S., the Washington DC project may launch them further into the North American market.

&amp;#x200B;

The United States online gambling market was valued at $2.1B in 2020, and it is projected to register a CAGR of 17.34% during for the period 2021-2026.

&amp;#x200B;

As stated by Michele Ciavarella, Executive Chairman, ""we believe that we are extremely well positioned to convert investment in technology into revenue generating customer relationships in the U.S. and Canada heading into 2022, including our recent partnership to challenge for top position in North America by combining our leading-edge US. designed sportsbook technology with industry giant Lottomatica and their highly experienced and talented management team. We anticipate meaningful near-term milestones and look forward to providing updates on these developments as they unfold.""

&amp;#x200B;

ELYS statistics: Outstanding shares -23.3M, Float- 14.9M, FYE ‚Äì December 31, Insider holdings ‚Äì 38.8%, Cash (mrq) - $9.41M, 52-week high - $6.72/share, Revenue (ttm) $46.4M, Market value - $54M.

&amp;#x200B;

The three analysts below have a consensus price target of $7.91/share representing the potential for an upside of 239%.

&amp;#x200B;

10/6/2021 Fundamental Research Buy $5.72

8/24/2021 HC Wainwright Buy $8.00

7/26/2021 Maxim Group Buy $10.00

&amp;#x200B;

The chart below indicates shares that may be oversold. Having slipped below all the SMA levels and with an RSI (14) of 41.29 the company shares could be positioned for a significant swing. ELYS is a vibrant growing company and that doesn‚Äôt seem to be reflected in the PPS.

 **What Does Iconic Brands and Monster Beverage Have in Common?**  


Successful beverage companies, whether it be energy or alcohol are some of the highest growth stories in the market. Monster beverages is a great example in comparison to Iconic Brands.  


New Additions to the ICNB Sales Team Just Announced.¬†**These are key players with a history of building $Billion dollar brands.**  


Good day everyone,  


**Iconic Brands, Inc. (OTCQB: ICNB)**¬†sells, develops, and makes alcohol and non-alcohol beverages, operating through four subsidiaries.  


ICNB shares opened at $.3905 in the Monday session and gained to $.415 early. Trading volume in the first 30 minutes was at 47K shares.  


Current price $.40/share (+ 2.43% at 10:00 am EST 3-31-22)  


In news released this morning,¬†[ICNB announced new regional sales](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iconic-brands-bolsters-national-product-134100698.html)¬†leaders have been added to their team. The latest sales team brings over 150 years of expertise and industry experience in sales and marketing, and distribution of wine, beer, spirits and soft drinks for major brands and alcohol beverage companies including Jim Beam Brands, Diageo, PepsiCo, and others.  


These new members of the Company‚Äôs sales team have a history of successfully building multi-billion-dollar brands.¬†**Follow the link above**¬†for a bio of each of these new members, and the current members, of the ICNB sales team.  


Looking at ICNB makes me think about the success of Monster Beverage (MNST) and their story. Years ago, MNST was a stock trading at $.50/share, same range as ICNB. MNST was able to identify a trend in energy drinks, able to capitalize on it and the company grew to what it is today with its shares trading at $80 and a market value of $4.5B.  


ICNB has not only joined the Ready to Drink (RTD) trend, but they are also innovators in the Ready to Freeze (RTF) and Better for You (BFY) niches and are going to lead in the box/pouch packaging trend in alcoholic beverages with their¬†**new solar powered, state of the art manufacturing facility**. RTD/RTF/BFY beverages, along with box/pouch packaging are the hot trends in the alcoholic beverage sector. Could Iconic Brands be the next Monster Beverage level growth story?  


**Once again:**¬†Premixed cocktails sales in the United States surged 42.3% to $1.6 billion compared with a year earlier, becoming the fastest-growing spirits category, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S.  


  
**original report below** 

&amp;#x200B;

Good day everyone,

With two catalysts at work, Iconic Brands, Inc. (OTCQB: ICNB), a company that sells alcohol and non-alcohol beverages looks like it could be climbing to new highs. Their accretive acquisition from last year is adding significantly to their verticals, and they just announced a new product line with their partner, supermodel Christie Brinkley.

Current price $.42/share

As I outline the revenue growth figures below, notice that Q321 revenues equal the total of FYE 2020 revenues reflecting the expansion moves the company has been making.

**YOY revenue gains:**

FYE 2018 $566KFYE 2019 $1.2MFYE 2020 $2.8M (+235%)

**QOQ revenue gains:**

Q121 $634KQ221 $585KQ321 $2.8M (+480%)

**ICNB is in a high growth mode**. I expect the company could release its FYE 2021 financial results in mid-April (two weeks) if they stay consistent with previous practice. I‚Äôm eager to see the level of FYE revenues given the giant leap in Q321.

**ICNB statistics:**

Outstanding shares ‚Äì 89.6M. Float ‚Äì 61.59M shares, FYE ‚Äì 12-31, Most recent quarter reported 9-30-21, Q321 revenue $2.8M ‚Äì 52 week high - $1.00/share. I expect ICNB may file its FYE21 10-K in a few weeks.

In¬†[news that just broke Tuesday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iconic-brands-launches-line-premium-130500823.html), the company announced that it has launched Bellissima Zero, a new line of zero sugar still wines created by Bellissima Prosecco and co-developed by Bellissima brand partner, supermodel, actress and entrepreneur, Christie Brinkley. Bellissima Zero is available in five expressions: Pinot Grigio IGT, Chardonnay IGT, Ros√© Wine, Merlot IGT and Cabernet Sauvignon IGT.

Christie Brinkley, who has appeared on over 500 magazine covers worldwide, served as a spokesperson for CoverGirl and performed on Broadway, on television and in film, stated, ‚ÄúI am incredibly proud to introduce Bellissima Zero sugar still wines. We have worked tirelessly to create a delicious line of premium quality still wines that provide a delicious taste and a unique experience and continue our vision of providing healthier choices for our customers. I believe Bellissima Zero is a perfect blend of flavor, appearance, and sustainability at an ideal price.‚Äù

Earlier this month,¬†[ICNB invited investors and media](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iconic-brands-hosts-tour-newest-150000556.html)¬†to attend the March 1, 2022, unveiling of TopPop‚Äôs (their July 2021 acquisition) state-of-the-art 65,000 square foot facility. The new facility is solar powered and FDA-registered, Safety Quality Food (SQF)-certified, Kosher and Organic production-certified, TTB &amp; NJ ABC approved.

The facility will produce frozen ice-pops, stand-up flexible pouches, single-serve shots, organic juice pops, dog treats and more. During the tour they were able to demonstrate their eco-friendly flexible packaging solutions for Ready to Drink (RTD), Ready to Freeze (RTF) beverages, and other applications. Premixed cocktails sales in the United States surged 42.3% to $1.6 billion compared with a year earlier, becoming the¬†**fastest-growing spirits category**, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. The facility is starting production of those products now. A 65,000 square foot facility can generate significant revenues. This new facility may be the driver for growth at ICNB.

**INCB subsidiary operations:**

**BiVi Sicilian Vodka**¬†(51%) - acquired in 2015.The company has a license agreement for endorsement and royalties with an entity owned by Chazz Palminteri.

**Bellissima Sparkling Wines**¬†(51%) ‚Äì acquired in 2016 and distribute sparkling and still wines through a variety of distribution avenues. The company has a license agreement for endorsement and royalties with an entity owned by Christie Brinkley, and as detailed above just added a new product line.

**United Spirits**¬†(100%) ‚Äì recently acquired in July 2021. United provides distribution services for Iconic, BiVi and Bellissima.

**Top Pop**¬†(100%) ‚Äì recently acquired in July 2021. Top Pop is a brand owner and contract manufacturing and packaging company specializing in flexible packaging solutions in the food, beverage, and health categories. Its first branded and contract products are alcohol-infused ice pops. Its manufacturing facility in Marlton, New Jersey is registered by the Federal Drug Administration and holds a Safe Quality Food certification.

As the chart below indicates, ICNB shares crossed their SMA20 of $.40 and SMA50 of $.42 this week before a soft retreat. With the recent developments at the company, I can see a potential bounce past the SMA200 of $.48/share, moving closer to the November high of $1.00/share. I note the chart pattern of peaks, indicating the potential for a gain near term. I note that the company shares were at $.51 (+34%) just 23 days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

This is an exciting time for Iconic and its stakeholders as revenues take a giant leap. The Ready to Drink (RTD) and Better for You (BFY) alcoholic beverage markets are hot right now and ICNB is poised to benefit with their new line of Zero sugar still wines and a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for RTD products.

I will have updates on this report soon.

**M&amp;A and Partnerships**

* Exclusive partnership with **LiUNA**, the **largest construction union in Canada,** along with employers and union groups complements Entourage‚Äôs direct sales to medical patients. ( 500,000 members throughout North America, with over 100,000 members across Canada. Not including extended benefits to family members)
* Relationships in the **seniors‚Äô market and supply agreements with Shoppers Drug MartEight provincial distribution agencies** where adult-use brands Color Cannabis and Saturday are sold.

**New of 2021**

* **Canntx** Craft Cultivator **Acquisition** with addition of its assets (5 to 25M according to [Sedar](https://www.sedar.com/DisplayProfile.do?lang=EN&amp;issuerType=03&amp;issuerNo=00045925) documents)
* **Boston Beer** \- Cannabis **Beverages** \- (Started Production in 4th Quarter 2021)

* **Revity -** Fire &amp; Flower - **Edibles** (available now)
* **Olli Brands** \- **Edibles** (available now)

**Canntx is the biggest and most relevant purchase.** I find it very interesting how little detail was released about this acquisition. I can‚Äôt find any information of its Guelph, ON facility size, plant yield, margins etc. but in the most recent earnings Entourage praised Canntx on conference call for its quality and ability to cultivate good product and plans to implement its producers across the board which will allow them to 'command higher price points'

Another is the Medical Patches.. Liuna labour workers + medical patches =‚Ä¶ hmmmmmm????

**Their Board**

* **CEO - George Scorsis (aka. Papa Georgie)** \- Former Red Bull Management of 10 years, with an edumaction in Marketing and Strategies
* **VP - Jeff Keyes** \- 20 years of management in production of perishable foods for companies like Maple Leaf foods. Last 4 years have been pharmaceuticals and Entourage Health

Honestly, This list goes on and on, even the people who came from Canntx are experts of their craft with extensive education and experience in their specialty. This aint Nikola where the Management is made up of family.

**Insider Trading of 2021/2022**

I‚Äôm not so much interested in the shares but how a lot of the new board members opted for options that had strike prices of $0.60 to $1.80 which gives me a bit of confidence in my position. If their belied was that it could make .60 but not for a year or two. Board members would be buying shares.

Not as notable because of the small size of investment but the hedge fund below picked up shares this past quarter which shows someone smarter than me did research and thought this was a play worth some investment.

However they did reduce this position by about . 4% (yeah not a huge difference but I‚Äôm trying to be as transparent as possible)

**This is a Pro vs Con situation. -** Share Dilution vs Vote of confidence because right now none of these are worth jack sh\*t. But the implication is that The companies who were given the warrants this year entered into the contract because they believe the stock will surpass that price point.

***Ok Cool beans let's talk Fundamentals - because it‚Äôs a bit of a trip***

**Fundamentals &amp; Projections**

**Debt**

They currently hold 98M debt and had a gross revenue of 54M last year. They‚Äôve never been unable to make good on their debts, and It seems their gross rev will surpass their debt this year.

**Cashburn**

Cashburn is the real  issue of this company. This is what has created such a negative sentiment, as they spent money to improve infrastructure, shuffling of procedures, acquisitions, the stock suffered greatly. If you own a portion of Entourage prior to reading this, there is a 98% chance you lost money.

Net Profit last year was $-80M. And they are at a deficit of $-97.8M.

https://preview.redd.it/y4l9aujm80q81.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c856e41e1515fee0c383684af29ea34110d7032

Okay So - they are making more money then ever but ‚Ä¶. They are losing more money than ever??

But are they? Yes and no. No because 2020 -12 - 31 has completely skewed their financials.

Yes Because their Margins are still sh\*t regardless.

Okay so it‚Äôs losing money - Here is 4 reasons why I bought them:

1. Decreasing Costs
2. Increasing Revenue
3. Scalability
4. Forwards Statements
5. **Cost Decrease:**

* Cost Per gram decreased from 2.11 to 0.55$ per gram
* Refinancing of Debt is at the forefront of their efforts right now
* Selling And admin costs fell by over 50% to 4,660($M)
* On January 7, 2021, Entourage  announced that it reallocated all medical packaging, labelling and distribution activities from the Bowmanville Facility to the Aylmer Facility that also houses Entourage ‚Äôs extraction hub. This reallocation was part of Entourage‚Äôs ongoing plan to maximize the use of its facilities, improve operational efficiencies and further align its cost structure while focusing on growth.

1. **Increase Revenue:**

* Revenue increase YOY of 92%
* Retail increase YOY of 102%

1. **Scalability**

* Intent to scale their 296,000 sq. ft Facility with 18 greenhouse flowering rooms.to a total **footprint of more than 500,000 sq. ft**.
* **ability to increase to a total of up from 27 to 100 acres of outdoor cultivation**.

1. **Future Developments (the hypest sh\*t ever)**

* Their intention to leverage their current product into higher quality for larger margins (this is huge)
   * Especially when they supply the biggest labor union in canada in an aging population
* **Confidence to turn a 25-30% Gross EBITA Margin  NO LATER then 4th quarter.**
* ‚ÄúMedical - commands higher quality - you may see royal city cannabis leveraged into this portfolio as a higher margin return in upcoming months‚Äù
* ‚Äúlooking at high margin for products and leverage their product into higher sku‚Äù - Q3 conference call
* ‚ÄúAggregate numbers will change with automation and other changes‚Äù  - Q3 conference call
* Regarding there recent 20M loan ‚ÄúThe Credit Facility will be used by Entourage for **general working capital purposes** as the Company continues to focus on sustainable profitable growth, part of which will be driven by **upgrading and standardizing** its cultivation practices with **recently acquired tissue culture business,** and by **introducing new genetics for high-margin products** expected to drive commercial growth in 2022.‚Äù - found on SEDAR

The excerpt from sedar (above)  is of high interest to me Since on Canntx‚Äôs website (before it was redirected to ENTG) their two main marketing points were: high grade medical cannabis &amp; [VERTICAL Farming.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak4RHYpfHIU&amp;ab_channel=FluenceByOSRAM)

https://preview.redd.it/ml6uqlwq80q81.png?width=934&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84047adf1e3788161fb179e3a88f3e4697fb37a9

which is exactly what [medmen did to yield an additional 157% more cannabis annually](https://fluence.science/cannabis-vertical-farm/) However, There is some speculation because of increased costs with this setup, i.e. more power for lights, more HVAC etc.

**Technicals/ Intrinsic Value**

25-30% Gross EBITA Margin  NO LATER then 4th quarter.That little statement on their conference call (around the Q3 - 30min mark) Implies there is something massive we aren‚Äôt being told.

https://preview.redd.it/45c54g7t80q81.png?width=572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eb41f474a1b77385c7f960d72fecb48e4cac448

The above chart it a hypothetical with some easy math to get the right number (hopefully I‚Äôm not too lazy to come back and fix this)

We‚Äôll come back to this in a moment

**Cannabis Yield**

I have some done some attempts to interpret the following information, to which I welcome and encourage criticism

* 27 acres have the ability to yield 70,000kg of biomass per year (I‚Äôm assuming they mean ‚Äòwet‚Äô product)
* Commercial horticulture, a 5%-8% annual loss can be expected due to insect infestations, plant disease. However this will require labor and effort to remove and stop regardless if it can't be sold
* where yield from dried cannabis is traditionally ¬º of ‚Äúwet weight‚Äù
* 70,000\*1000(to convert to grams) \*0.25 (¬º for dried weight)\*.95(for 5%loss of product) = 16,625,000g

Production Cost 0.55$ per gram and 1$ gov taxation per graham

**REVENUE POTENTIAL** Using Past Quarter Sales % Multiplied by projected max output

https://preview.redd.it/6wg3gybv80q81.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12cb6ced5d66a04e877e38bdcc760fec6ac4f1bd

**Does not Take into account the following:**

* High Margin Goods:
   * Edibles - Fastest Growing market in Canada
   * Beverages - which is their new market (production just started)
   * Increased interest in Medical Cannabis (which is their intent)
* Canntx - their revenue/debt (they have a 333,000 sq ft facility with vertical farming)
* Potential that some of the facilities into vertical farming for higher cheaper yield

In my DCF analysis:  I am using FCFE not FCFF because with cross references the recent $20M makes NWC in conflict.

If you‚Äôre a value investor, you‚Äôre about to punch air when you see this janky af DCF, It‚Äôs just for visual purposes please calm down. Yes it‚Äôs really predicting quarterly growth.

https://preview.redd.it/mhfyfxlw80q81.jpg?width=743&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9863dd0c04de1b3e025427adbb72cffeb848935

https://preview.redd.it/4fwetc0x80q81.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6a63560fa478bb622c8ac4bd1f45358f6e62f31

I will revisit these numbers after the Fiscal EOY review (April 1st)

I found The **Current Fair Value to be $0.42 (intrinsic value)**

**Canaccord** fair value analysis was $0.40 - 9 months ago.. (‚Äú9 months? Is this still relevant?‚Äù Yes, as on the ENTG Q3 Conference call they asked questions regarding the company's NWC which indicates they are still very much so involved.)

2022 EOY Value Estimate - **$0.76**

**Keep in mind THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE Canntx Facilities and their Revenue/COGS etc as information is limited. Canntx acquisition included a 330,000 Sq ft. Facility that was purchased at a value of $17 Million**

But that's still **only Intrinsic Value** = Does not include extrinsic value. I.e. Brand awareness, percentage of market share, reliability of income.

**True Intrinsic Value + Extrinsic Value = $1.56? $1.60?** The companies who accepted warrants sure think so. Maybe they know something I don‚Äôt.

**Assumptions to Create DCF:**

* 100M revenue because they have grown profits YOY around 90% prior to Canntx acquisition so this is feasible especially with new partnerships and Canntx. (UPDATE: Fiscal end year reports 22M made last Q - unaudited)
* EBIT - 29.1% as EBITA is projected for high 20s mid 30s. I went with 27.5 + D&amp;A which resulted in 29.1%
* Taxes - averaged
* EBIAT - filled itself
* D&amp;A - averaged
* CAPEX -averaged
* (adding) NWC + 20M funding - reduced by 4.5 over the course of the year, as their intent is profit rather than acquisition I see this being feasible. reduced from their average yearly of 5.4
* Shares Compensated dilution due to warrants

Overall Annual Net income predictions: **2-4.5 Million dollars**. Lol yes really. But hey **profit is profit back to the share holders,** and they have absolutely insane growth they are achieving year over year and making good on paying all their dues on time. This could really be something beautiful in the making

Perhaps something for the watch list at least - for the sake of watching me blow up my account.

2026 EOY Value Estimate - ??? I can‚Äôt make a DCF for that until things level out as growth HAS to slow at some point. I would think maybe 3-4$? But I‚Äôm not trying get excited about 5000% gainz until things are proven a bit more

**SPECULATIONS OF FUTURE OUTPUT**

* Will update these predictions in April and March after earnings reports
* Expand their 27 acres to (already owned) 100 acres is nearly a 4x increase in cultivation
   * Also the possibility of vertical farming technology they now have
* expand their 296,000 sq ft facilities to 508 sq ft. (nearly 2x) (which could be necessary to process this much product)
   * They also have Canntx Facilities of 330,000 Sq ft. that produces high grade cannabis

Conservatively you could say without any additional acquisition and just building out their current operation they could over time build up to have a revenue of upwards of **$500 Million.** From 54M(unaudited).  **The potential of a x9.26% increase in revenue.**

Reasons why they may not be accurate:

* cost of infrastructure build out
* labor costs may not be linear
* time of infrastructure build out may not be linear
* human error(on site and in my own predictions)
* Possibly Not enough Demand
* Canada cannabis legislative changes (reducing costs) in 2023
* America Legalizations (ENTG is a supplier for Luina aka America's biggest labour union!)

The Last two years they mostly disregarded profits in favour of getting ahead of the competition and product development.. They have arrived. And I‚Äôm doing deep.

Positions: 350,000 shares @ average of $0.1032

\- I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE CRITICISM, PLEASE POKE HOLES IN MY THINKING -

\*\*This is not investment advice, purely for entertainment and possibly educational purposes. Do your own research, call bullshit on everyone and everything. You don‚Äôt know me. I could work at a banana stand. Think about it.. what rational person puts majority of their portfolio in one stock?. \*\*

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: I was reliant on these past two earning reports to establish an upward trend, They have has increase in sales and revenue - however they still have a large deficit every month of about 10M.

I am sitting at a 51% loss and have **closed out** 225k of 350k share excepting a loss of about 16k. The  of risk management. 

short term i.e. remainder of 2022 I do not expect to see a positive turn around and expect a quarterly cost to remain negative. The lack of transparency and interest in generating a positive return to shareholders in interest of debtholders says for the meantime money is best invested elsewhere. They however have their annual shareholders meeting June 10th so it is possible they will have something to bring back a bit of confidence in shareholders. 

Long term - 2023 I will consider rebuying in if they have quarters where they are near to having a positive growth month that EXCEEDS expenses. this is a company that has amazing connections but I feel I was wrong to place my confidence in this early.

**Cosmos Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: COSM)**¬†is a pharmaceutical company, with a proprietary line of nutraceuticals and distributor of branded and generic pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, OTC medications and medical devices through an extensive, established global distribution network.

**Current price $2.38/share**

**Note: COSM shares had a 1.2% uptick in the last 30 minutes of the Friday session, then gained 4.6% more in after hours trading.**

I consider COSM a value right now as the company shares have fallen off recent highs of $3.57/share on March 4th, and $4.15/share on December 29th. The 52-week high is $7.77/share.¬†**The company is currently valued at a¬†very¬†low .74X of sales.**

Cosmos Holdings up listed (formerly listed on OTCQX) to the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol COSM on February 28, 2022. The company celebrated the listing by ringing the NASDAQ Closing Bell on March 11th in Times Square, New York City. COSM is based in Chicago and conducts most of its product distribution business in the European Union and Mediterranean countries.

The company is presenting at the Virtual Growth Conference, presented by Maxim Group LLC, and hosted by M-Vest, on March 28th - 30th from 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. ET. (happening now)

**Last week CEO Greg Siokas** [**issued a letter to shareholders**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cosmos-holdings-ceo-provides-letter-132500565.html)**, and I want to point out some of the highlights:**

This year COSM will increase its digital marketing and e-commerce investment to gain market share, lower cost of entry, and speed time to market in new geographic territories, including the growing number of online-only e-pharmacies.

It plans to add 40 to 50 new, advanced nutraceutical products, including the new SPL Mediterranean Line in Q2 2022.

It expects to launch Amazon Stores in Germany, Italy, Spain, and France starting in mid-2022; and in Singapore, Brazil, and the U.S. in 2H22.

COSM aims to increase 2022 revenues to over $65M while increasing gross margin to 18%.

The company is actively looking for accretive acquisitions to scale their business through vertical integration.

Expansion beyond their current EU and Mediterranean geographic markets, moving into the North American and Asian markets.

COSM wants to expand its nutraceuticals product lines citing better margins than the generic and OTC drugs it sells and is looking at an addressable global market reaching $658B over the next six years.

**I included a detailed description of the COSM operations, taken from their most recent 10-Q, at the bottom of this newsletter and here are the highlights:**

COSM has a large network of over 160 clients &amp; vendors in Germany, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Denmark, Italy, France, Singapore, Ireland, Sweden, Poland, Netherlands, and Greece. They have offices and distribution centers in Thessaloniki, Greece &amp; In Harlow, UK.

**The company operates three subsidiaries:**

Sky Pharm - trades the excess amounts of about 500 medicines that can be exported within the EU countries. They buy from Greek wholesale pharmaceutical companies and multinational pharmaceutical manufacturers, and export to European markets where demand and prices are substantially higher.

Decahedron Ltd. - is a pharmaceutical wholesaler incorporated in the UK. They import and export branded, generic and unlicensed POM, OTCs, and medical devices all over the world. Their network consists of 25 clients and vendors and has expanded to nine countries.

Cosmofarm Pharmaceuticals - is a fully licensed pharmaceutical wholesale company operating in the greater Athens area and serves approximately 1500 independent retail pharmacies and 40 pharmaceutical wholesalers in the greater Athens, Greece region by providing brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and dietary supplements.

COSM shares have fallen below their SMA50 of $3.16 and SMA200 of $4.69 absent any negative events. I feel the chart set up is ripe for a significant swing near term.

The company outlook for 2022, just publicized by the CEO, combined with the conference presentation happening NOW, seem to be generating investor interest in this oversold company. I don‚Äôt expect the price/sales ratio of .74X to last.

**Company description and acquisition plans from the last 10-Q:**

""Cosmos Holdings Inc. is a multinational pharmaceutical company. The Company imports, exports and distributes pharmaceutical products of brand-name and branded pharmaceuticals, over the counter (OTC) medicines, and a variety of dietary and vitamin supplements through its established network. Currently, the Company operates its business through its three wholly owned subsidiaries: (i) SkyPharm, headquartered in Thessaloniki, Greece; (ii) Decahedron Ltd., head-quartered in Harlow, United Kingdom; and (iii) Cosmofarm, headquartered in Athens, Greece. Cosmofarm was acquired in 2018 and we believe this expansion has increased our sales and profit margins as we vertically integrate our business model. The Company also has an extensive and established distribution direct and indirect network within the European Union (EU).

The Company‚Äôs cross-border pharmaceutical business serves wholesale pharmaceutical distributors and independent retail pharmacies across the EU through a network of three strategic distribution centers, as well as an additional warehousing facility. Pharmaceutical manufacturers generally implement variable pricing strategies within the EU market. Identifying and evaluating price spreads between EU member states enables the Company to source brand-name pharmaceuticals from countries where ex-factory prices are comparatively low and export to countries where the same products are priced higher. The Company focuses on leveraging its growing purchasing scale and supplier relationships to secure discounts and provide pharmaceuticals at reduced prices and on continuing to drive organic growth at attractive margins for its cross-border pharmaceutical wholesale business.

The Company regularly evaluates and undertakes strategic initiatives to expand its distribution reach, improve its profit margins, and strengthen its competitive position. In 2018, the Company entered the vitamins and dietary supplements segment and in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company posted the first sales of its own brand of nutraceuticals: Sky Premium Life¬Æ. Through the December 2018 acquisition of Cosmofarm, the Company entered the full-line pharmaceutical wholesale distribution segment. Cosmofarm now serves approximately 1500 independent retail pharmacies and 40 pharmaceutical wholesalers in the greater Athens, Greece region by providing brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and dietary supplements. We invest in technology to enhance safety, distribution and warehousing efficiency and reliability. Cosmofarm operates two robotic ROWA‚Ñ¢, a German fully automated warehouse system, that ensure 0% error selection rate, accelerate order fulfillment, and yield higher cost-efficiency in our Athens distribution center.

We make use of analytics and customer feedback from our EU-wide network of wholesale pharmaceutical distributors and independent retail pharmacies to identify and evaluate which nutraceutical product codes of the brand Sky Premium Life¬Æ to be developed, commercialized and to be added to our portfolio. We intend to continue to bring Sky Premium Life¬Æ products to market primarily through our existing network of over 160 pharmaceutical wholesale clients and vendors and approximately 1,200 independent retail pharmacies within the EU market. Moreover, we have penetrated several markets through digital sale channels. There is growing demand for vitamins and food supplements, and we are committed to developing quality products and creating enhanced customer value.

We regularly evaluate acquisition targets that would allow us to expand our distribution reach and/or vertically integrate into the supply chain of the products that we currently distribute. We believe that the demand for reasonably priced medicines, delivered on time and in the highest quality is set to increase in the years to come, as the population‚Äôs life expectancy increases. With our product portfolio of patented and non-patented medicines, we contribute to the optimization of efficient medicinal care, and thereby lowering cost for health insurance funds, companies, and patients. We also believe that the demand for non-prescription wellness products such as food and dietary supplements will continue to increase as individuals are increasingly supplementing their nutritional intake.

We believe the EU pharmaceutical import/export market will continue to grow. We continue to encounter competition in the market as we grow. The competition comes in the form of level of service, reliability, and product quality. On the procurement side, we continue to expand our vendor base.

Are we sure that he wasn't a simulation?

I was hiking today and saw a vision in the distance.

It looked like a monkey holding a golden banana.

As I walked closer, the monkey turned into a duck holding a water gun motioning me to come closer.

Then all of the sudden the vision turned into a cell phone.

And the cell phone started ringing.

And ringing.

And ringing.

And then I heard a ""Hello.""

And a ""Stop there.""

So I stopped.

Then after thirty seconds the voice from the phone told me that DFV is coming. Not today but soon. And not tomorrow but maybe the next day. Or the day after that. But not until the market crashes and GameStop returns back down to $4 per share. 

And on the day that DFV returns, we will start the MOASS.

And that will be the grandmother of all MOASSes.

And that once he was done, he would be a billionaire and share tendies with all of the true believers.

Or maybe I was just hungry.

TLDR: $NNDM is insanely low risk, has great financials, and could be a 20x


Ok so, let me paint a picture. I‚Äôve been spending the last 7 weeks or so, trying to find a high value play that could potentially work as a high value play. I have been using market screeners etc and one of the few stocks which is 
1. Undervalued
2. Has huge cash reserves
3. In a significant decline 

Is, NNDM.

Ok, so what do Nano Dimensions do? 

*Nano Dimension is an Israeli manufacturer that specialises in intelligent machines for the 3D printing of high fidelity active electronic and electromechanical subassemblies. Components such as these are essential to the functioning of things like AI drones, cars, satellites, smartphones, and in vivo medical devices, all of which demand iterative development, and thus rapid prototyping and production. Using additive manufacturing methods Nano Dimension are able to produce integrated circuits at unprecedented speed and performance. In order to do this the company uses software with a SOLIDWORKS add-in and their proprietary DragonFly LDM‚Ñ¢ technology, an extension of the award-winning DragonFly Pro precision system.*

They have Huge contracts and with $1.4 **billion** (yes billion) in cash reserves have the money required to make potential acquisition and continue business for years. 

They are pioneers and at the cutting edge of their industry, an industry which is required in developing cars, phones etc. Some of our most used every day objects.

A company like this, worth less than its own cash reserves and with so much potential should not be so cheap. My personal price target is $40-60 in 3 years. Very ambitious, I know. However I truly believe it could happen. In addition to this, it is reporting earnings on the 31st of March. Their last earnings have all resulted in huge gear on year increases in revenue and I believe this could be a catalyst that‚Äôs gives us a good 15-20% of the start.

Disclaimer, this is my first time writing up my DD so forgive me if it isn‚Äôt the neatest of best set out."|0.81|9|0|9

But the Fed Chairman Mr Powell said due to the Ukraine war's effect on consumer prices they might not only raise it bit raise it by more than the standard 25 basis points.

What does this do? Well, it increases the amount of money in government bonds, so more people will lend the Fed money. But the Fed will not spend this money, but delete it in order to reverse all the money they printed earlier. It's an expensive process, but necessary to keep world currency stable. Yes, I mean world as a lot of internation trade is done in dollars and a long list of foreign currencies are pegged to the dollar.

This effects your mortgage as the Federal funds rate is the rate banks borrow money from the government. If the Federal rate goes up, the bank's rate goes up. This effects companies that are growing as they will be able to borrow less, which is a big deal with stocks because growth stocks must borrow money to, well, grow. Also, people buy growth stocks on the assumption they'll make money later, hense the occasional absurd valuations. If the math says they cannot grow as fast because interest rates, people will dump growth stocks.

In case you were wondering why your Tesla calls got demolished recently. ;)

Value stocks are the opposite of growth, and they aren't effected by this as generally these companies lend instead of borrow. But ordinarily value stocks don't do as well as growth stocks for obvious reasons. However, in high interest environments and in non-growing economies, value will outperform growth as market forces will quickly tear up any company that isn't immediately profitable.

Now I'm not here to bore you by saying you should drop your favorite high risk stock, instead I have a play to capitalize on this. I am holding:

SPYG: -60 shares

SPYV: 100 shares

SPYG is an ETF holding the growth companies from SPY, and SPYV holds the value stocks. Unsurprisingly,  their biggest holdings are Apple and Berkshire-Hathaway respectively. Due to stock prices this is a slightly bullish position, and I chose shares because my broker allows leverage based on portfolio volatility. Buying a call and put would reduce my allowed borrowing significantly brutal expiry dates would ensue because the Fed moves like a snail. I must be content with 2.5x leverage.

If I am lucky, after the Plunge Protection Team meets at the beginning of next month they'll raise the rate by 25 basis points or higher. This will destroy your calls and make me a tidy profit... As long as value outperforms growth."|0.86|5|0|5

9:50 AM ET 3/22/22 | Dow Jones
    
   -- Company reports pre-order sales from existing customers of its wireless 
      wearable device for early detection of cardiac arrhythmias 

REDWOOD CITY, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 22, 2022 / Biotricity, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTCY) (""Biotricity"" or the ""Company""), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, will officially launch the commercial sales of its FDA cleared, wireless wearable cardiac monitoring device, Biotres, in April 2022. The product has been available for pre-orders to physicians, medical offices, hospitals and individual use since late-February 2022. 

Biotres is the Company's revolutionary technology that represents the future of Remote Patient Monitoring and the delivery of real-time diagnostic data. It serves as a three-lead device designed to continuously record electrocardiogram (ECG) data for early detection of cardiac arrhythmias, disrupting the conventional one-lead patch Holter monitor which takes longer analysis time and diagnosis time. 

Biotres received FDA 510(k) clearance in January 2022, opening up a new market and expanding Biotricity's total addressable market to $5.7 Billion. Since taking pre-orders last month, the Company has experienced strong demand for Biotres from existing customers. The Company has plans to roll out additional complementary products throughout 2022, following the same approach as Biotres. Each solution will grow the company's TAM, creating new revenue streams for existing customers while expanding its customer base. 

Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq, Biotricity Founder and CEO, commented, ""After months of anticipation, our Biotres product is finally available for sale. Judging by the amount of pre-order interest we've seen since February, Biotres can provide millions of individuals with an early detection method to easily and efficiently record cardiac arrhythmias. We are optimally positioned to penetrate a $2 billion-dollar holter market that needs a faster and more efficient approach, critical to improving patient lives.""

I'm back to share with you some important information.

AMC Bagholders are in a bad spot.

A Aron decided to buy into a gold miner with shareholder capital.

Sure. Gold is doing well, but what does this guy know about running or investing into a mine?

To keep things short. He knows nothing. Nada. Zero.

Seriously. He does NOT know one thing about it.

Don't believe me?

Read this:

https://doomberg.substack.com/p/a-fool-and-his-gold?s=r

See. He doesn't know anything about what his company bought.

Because if he did, he wouldn't have signed up shareholders for the absolute dumpster fire coming. 

So if you own the shares, get out before it dumps.

Because you still have time to move it to something else.

Like gift certificates at Chipotle or bags of potato chips.

Because at least with those, you'll have something to eat after the SEC gets finished with AMC.

It's really sad. AMC used to be a great company and innovator in the movie theater business before this moron got put in charge.

Happy trading and remember:

Only you can prevent portfolio dumpster fires."|0.61|15|0|15

NAV is currently sitting at near marketcap 122M

Total Assets 146M , 62,000 in cash, Total liabilities 22M.

Current FCF is negative \~250k quarterly, but that's probably fine if they can use assets to leverage more credit I'm assuming.

Net income isn't terrible. Negative a few million quarterly here. Positive a few million quarterly there.

I assume dilution and downtrends are done after despac. Insider ownership is high like 75%+

P/S and other ratios look decent.

I've heard they're projected to reach 600M in revenue and price targets are 8-16+,

Seems their business model is changing to digital pay per view, not subscriptions, and also along with kiosks and existing brand image. Apparently that's something analysts are talking about competing well with subscriptions is pay per view etc. there's a technical term. Eh whatever, need a full analysis on their business model still.

I haven't done the full DD yet but with this near NAV and the fact that it's not being spammed everywhere I assume it's still early to this.

I'm taking decent position size and will be ready to scale in if somehow we dip again. I don't think so though.

I still have my MULN and other positions. Learn to make multiple plays in this market at the same time.

**UPDATED 03/16/22 7AM EST**

**Let‚Äôs Look at the Team Driving Success at U.S. Gold (USAU) and How Their Experience Fits the Development of the CK Gold Project**

**USAU News Out: ‚ÄúUpdated assay results further support the company‚Äôs projections of one million ounces of gold‚Äù**

Good day everyone,

U.S. Gold Corp. (NASDAQ: USAU) is a gold exploration and development company with properties in Wyoming, Nevada, and Idaho.

Current price¬†¬† ¬†$8.60/share

In¬†[news that broke Today¬†](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gold-corp-finds-further-134700224.html)/ Tuesday, the company updated the assay results for a portion of the drilling conducted during the 2021 field season and the news is good. The updated assay results further support the company‚Äôs projections of one million ounces of gold and 248K tons of copper as indicated in their Pre-Feasibility Study from last year.

Kevin Francis, V.P. Exploration and Technical Services, of USAU said: ""While we know that we have a high-grade zone starting at surface with minimal waste rock stripping required, we are encouraged by further evidence of higher grades than currently modeled."" In the press release Mr. Francis details the assay results and you can look at them at the link above. I read it and the gist of it is ‚Äúthe results are better than we anticipated.‚Äù¬†

I have followed and reported on USAU for years and it‚Äôs my favorite Junior Mining company. Not only do they have some great properties with enormous potential, but they also operate in an investor friendly transparent environment. The commencement of a Feasibility Study at the CK Gold Project is a major milestone for the company and potentially a significant catalyst.

As the company begins the Feasibility Study at CK Gold, followed by permitting approval, financing and construction, the foundation of their management becomes crucial. I have always believed in the future success of USAU because of the team the company has put together.

I wanted to talk about the management at USAU and how they may contribute to the future of the company. The list below is neither complete nor are the full bios reiterated. Visit the¬†[company website](https://www.usgoldcorp.gold/about/management-team)¬†for full biographical information.

George Bee ‚Äì President, CEO and Chairman. Mr. Bee became President of the company in 2020 and is responsible for recent developments at the company and their current focus on the CK Gold Project.

In 2018 Mr. Bee concluded a third term with Barrick Gold as Senior VP Frontera District in Chile and Argentina to advance Pascua Lama feasibility as an underground mine. This capped a 16-year history with Barrick Gold with positions that included Mine Manager at Goldstrike during early development and operations, Operations Manager at Pierina Mine taking Pierina from construction to operations, and General Manager of Veladero developing the project from advanced exploration through permitting, feasibility and into production. Beyond his history at Barrick Gold Mr. Bee has been involved in senior management positions at several major mining operations all over the world. Mr. Bee is a respected member of the international gold mining community.¬†

Before Mr. Bee came on board, USAU focused on its Keystone Project in Nevada and CK Gold (then called Copper Creek) was an investment property the company held. Mr. Bee saw the size of the CK Gold property, and the Preliminary Economic Assessment done a few years earlier. He immediately turned his focus to the Wyoming property and has transformed the company into a mining exploration force. Mr. Bee‚Äôs leadership has been, and will continue to be, an integral component of the development of USAU.

Eric Alexander - CFO. Mr. Alexander has over 30 years of corporate operational and business experience, with over 15 years of mining industry experience. Previously he served as the Vice President Finance and Controller of Pershing Gold Corporation, a mining company (formerly NASDAQ: PGLC), from September 2012 until April 2019. Mr. Alexander‚Äôs mining specific financial experience will help as financing becomes critical to development of CK Gold.

Kevin Francis ‚Äì VP of Exploration and Technical Services. Mr. Francis has held many senior roles within the mining industry and most recently, he consulted to USAU as Principal of Mineral Resource Management LLC, a consultancy providing technical leadership on the CK Gold Project through his association with Gustavson Associates. Mr. Francis is a ‚ÄúQualified Person‚Äù as defined by SEC S-K 1300 and Canadian NI 43-101 reporting standards and holds both an M.S. degree and a B.A. in geology from the University of Colorado. His history with the CK Gold Project and specifically the Pre-Feasibility Study will be invaluable in working with Samuel Engineering during the Feasibility Study process.

The Honorable Ryan K. Zinke ‚Äì Director. His military career includes being a Navy Seal Commander with two tours of duty at SEAL Team SIX. He has been a State Senator (Montana), U.S. Congressperson and the 52nd Secretary of the Interior. He holds an MBA in Finance, an MS in Global Leadership, and a BS in Geology. Mr. Zinke would be a positive force at any company. The associations and contacts he made in his military and political careers may be vital to USAU particularly during the permitting process.

Robert W. Schafer - Director. Robert Schafer is a registered professional geologist with over 35 years international experience exploring for and discovering mineral deposits, four were producing mines including the Briggs (over one million ounces) and Griffon gold mines and Birkachan (over one million ounces) gold mine. Mr. Schafer has worked in more than eighty countries. His world class geological experience and expertise speaks for itself, and his presence lends credibility to the company.

Tara Gilfillan - Director. Tara Gilfillan is a CPA with over 25 years of experience as a financial executive and serial entrepreneur. She is currently the Founder and President of Optimize Group Inc. a mine-to-mill project development engineering company with offices in three continents. Ms. Gilfillan has held executive positions including CFO and Controller of several mining companies. Her project development and finance experience come at a crucial time for the company as the development of CK Gold and the associated financing loom ahead.

Once again,¬†

**Why I believe USAU shares may swing quickly:**

New developments at their CK Gold Project (see below)  
The prices of gold and copper are rising (see below)  
Tiny share structure with only 6.31M shares in the float  
Insiders own 14.26% of the outstanding shares and institutions own 12.25%  
Cash (mrq) $7.14M. FYE is April 30th.  
Current value is considerably below analyst‚Äô target of $20.75/share - over 100% upside (see below)  
USAU shares are still trading 30% off their 52-week high of $13.20/share

Now you should be seeing the full picture as to why I love this Gold Miner!

**Is USAU Next to be Part of the Consolidation (Buyout's) in the Red Hot Gold Sector?**

**AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) Just Bought a Stake in Hycroft Mining (NASDAQ: HYMC), Could U.S. Gold (USAU) Be Someone‚Äôs Else's Diversification Investment?**

Good Day Everyone,

**U.S. Gold Corp. (NASDAQ: USAU)** is a gold exploration and development company with properties in Wyoming, Nevada, and Idaho.

After closing the Monday session at $8.13/share, USAU climbed to $9.59 early on heavy¬† volume of 138K shares.¬†

Current price ¬† ¬†$9.05/share (**+ 11.32%** as of 10:04 am EST 3-15-22)

In news that broke this morning, AMC Entertainment (AMC) said it would invest $56 million in gold and silver producer Hycroft Mining Holding Corp (HYMC) along with Canadian fund manager Eric Sprott, a move the theater operator's CEO said would help the company diversify.

That move by AMC makes me wonder if USAU could become an acquisition target. Diversification into gold, silver, copper, and other minerals may be a savvy move for companies with cash that want a commodities-based cushion against economic woes. USAU could be a potential target due to its low market value and gold rich properties.

The price of gold, at this writing, is $1,919/oz, only 8% off its all-time high of $2,074/oz.

Very exciting development with USAU, working on feasibility study.

Good day everyone

**U.S. Gold Corp. (NASDAQ: USAU)**¬†is a gold exploration and development company with properties in Wyoming, Nevada, and Idaho.

Current price $8.13/share

**Why I believe USAU shares may swing quickly:**

* New developments at their CK Gold Project (see below)
* The prices of gold and copper are rising (see below)
* Tiny share structure with only 6.31M shares in the float
* Insiders own 14.26% of the outstanding shares and institutions own 12.25%
* Cash (mrq) $7.14M. FYE is April 30th.
* Current value is considerably below analyst‚Äô target of $20.75/share - over 100% upside (see below)
* USAU shares are still trading 30% off their 52-week high of $13.20/share

With¬†**gold prices trending to new highs**¬†and the company at a¬†**new advanced exploration level**, I believe that the USAU valuation could rise to a new high. I think it may get there soon, creating an opportunity for investors right now.

I last reported on USAU in January and now I want to update you on recent developments. For our many new members since January, USAU has four gold and mineral exploration projects; the CK Gold Project in Wyoming, the Keystone Project located on the gold rich Cortez Trend in Nevada, Maggie Creek, located on the prolific gold producing Carlin Trend in Nevada, and Challis Gold in Idaho. The company‚Äôs current focus is on developing the CK Gold Project.

The CK Gold property comprises about 1,120 acres (2 square miles), is¬†**100% owned by U.S. Gold**¬†Corp. and is located about 20 miles west of the city of Cheyenne, Wyoming. There is a fuller description of CK Gold at the bottom of this report.

The price of gold has been staying above $1,900/oz this month and crossed the $2,000/oz level last week. The current price of copper is $9,220/ton. Copper demand is on the rise and gold prices are trending. Aggregate, a byproduct of mining sells for $9.00 -$18.00/ton. These are three products USAU expects to produce at their CK Gold project. Gold companies at all levels do well when the prices of gold gains.

**Recent milestones at USAU:**

The next phase of engineering for the CK Gold project was¬†[just announced last week](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gold-corp-contracts-samuel-134700871.html). The company has awarded a contract for the next phase of engineering work to Samuel Engineering Inc. as USAU works towards a full Feasibility Study (FS). Samuel Engineering has a 25-year history, having serviced more than 300 customers worldwide (more on the FS below).

Earlier this month,¬†[in an update](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gold-corp-strengthens-balance-134700611.html)¬†on the CK Gold project, company President and CEO, George Bee said, ‚ÄúWith proven and probable reserves that currently stand at over 1 million ounces of gold and 248 million pounds of copper in a rising price environment, we believe that bringing this US domestic production will have widespread benefits.‚Äù

**At today‚Äôs prices, those proven and probable reserves mentioned above translate into $3.0 billion.**

On January 26, U.S. Gold Corp.¬†[announced a variety of updates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gold-corp-issues-ceo-141500814.html)¬†related to the advancement of its CK Gold project. The company continues to move the project through the permitting stage and towards a production decision in FY22 based on the recent publication of CK Gold‚Äôs Pre-feasibility Study. In turn, the company expects to file its mine plan permit in mid-FY22, while management anticipates about a 12-month approval process from state regulators. Given this timeline, U.S. Gold currently anticipates having its permit approved by mid-FY23 (the company FYE is April 30th).

In my opinion, the developments above transform USAU into an Advanced Stage Exploration Company.

The consensus analyst‚Äô rating on USAU is ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù and the average twelve-month price target is $20.75/share representing an upside over 100%.

**3/11/2022 HC Wainwright - Boost Target ‚Äì Buy $16.00 ‚ûù $16.5012/2/2021 Alliance Global- Boost Target ‚Äì Buy $20.00 ‚ûù $25.00**

HC Wainwright, in their recent analysis, states their USAU Discounted Cash Flow Valuation and boosted target price is based upon: ‚ÄúOur DCF analysis results in a valuation for the CK Gold project of $83.1M, or $9.71 per share. We add an unchanged total of $50.0M for the Challis ($28.0M), Keystone ($20.0M), and Orevada (Maggie Creek) ($2.0M) projects, in addition to U.S. Gold's cash balance of about $7.1M, to achieve our overall firm NAV of $140.2M, or $16.39 per share. Finally, we round this figure to our¬†**final price target of $16.50 per share.‚Äù**

**A Feasibility Study**¬†(of a mine proposal) is an evaluation of a proposed mining project to determine whether the mineral resource can be mined economically. Samuel Engineering will be looking at all the data collected by USAU thus far and much more as the company generates it. A Feasibility Study has several key objectives, and these are a few:

Demonstrate with reasonable confidence that the project can be constructed and operated in a technically sound and economically viable manner.

Provide a basis for detailed design and construction.

Enable the raising of finance for the project from banks or other sources.

The scope of a Feasibility Study is massive and a big step toward the future for USAU. This is the step where an outside company states, ‚Äúyes they can do this‚Äù and that‚Äôs when permit approval and operations start to happen.

Stay tuned for a full report on USAU where I discuss the management team that is moving this project along so quickly.

**About the CK Gold Project:**

The CK Gold Project was reportedly discovered in 1881, high-graded and saw limited mining. The first exploration work reported is drilling by ASARCO in 1938. Several additional rounds of drilling have been conducted since that time. In the 1972 Henrietta Mines Ltd. acquired the property and completed a comprehensive program of exploration and development. In addition to drilling, an I.P. survey, geologic mapping, geochemical sampling, and metallurgical testing were conducted (Nevin, 1973).

Drilling campaigns were conducted by Saratoga since 2006 and Strathmore since 2012, with a hiatus in drill exploration until the acquisition of the project by U.S. Gold Corp. from Energy Fuels in 2014. U.S. Gold Corp. conducted drilling in 2017, 2018, 2020 and is currently concluding its 2021 drilling program, focused on data collection to support post PFS and feasibility studies in 2022.

The CK Gold Project property is in the Silver Crown mining district of southeast Wyoming, approximately 20 miles west of the city of Cheyenne, on the southeastern margin of the Laramie Range. The Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) Granite Canyon Quarry sits just three miles south of CK Gold.

The property comprises about 1,120 acres (2 square miles) and is 100% owned by U.S. Gold Corp. In December 2021, the company released the project's SK-1300 Technical Report Preliminary Feasibility Study, PFS (by Gustavson Associates LLC). The project offers the company near-term, open-pit production potential as well as compelling value.

We will be back with more on USAU. This introduction should get everyone acquainted with US Gold and a good starting point for your analysis.
