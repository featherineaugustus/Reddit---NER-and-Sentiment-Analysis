t3_xcuhf1|1663033245|wallstreetbets|DD on Centra Tech Inc.|"Hi,

I believe I'm actively uncovering a government coverup. I believe it all starts with Centra Tech Inc.

There are 3 individuals that started this company. Robert Farkas, Raymond Trapani, and Sam Shurma. They all worked together in Miami at Miami Exotic Car Rentals.

Of these three individuals facing up to 70 years for their crimes for stealing over $30m in investments by using fraudulent information, Sam Shurma has the harshest sentence for 8 years due to his ""cooperation"". I also know that two of the co-defendants were found guilty of perjury in the 1st degree.

I also know that during the time of Raymond Trapani's arrest, he had heroine, cocaine, marijuana, and several other drugs such as Xanax and Adderall, implying a connection to criminal organizations.

During the FBI investigation, they asked Sam Shurma where the startup capital came from. He told the authorities that he had a private investor by the name of Mike who was Harvard educated. The FBI investigated and found that this individual never existed, however, they never followed up on the question of **where** the startup capital came from.

This is leading me to a dead end and where I need WSB's help. Given these individuals worked at an exotic car dealership in Miami, I have a firm belief that they knew or had connections to someone who knew Donald Trump. I would like to ask for your help tracking the money from Centra Capital Inc. Particularly, where their startup capital came from. I am completely lost of where to go from here without warrants or more information.

I have a theory on this that I'd like to share with you, as crazy as it sounds.

I believe Donald Trump heard about these guys from government officials. I believe Donald Trump was the reason the rap industry became what it was - he was the merger between rap/hip-hop by using his connections with the wealthy to put people like JayZ all over the radio. But not just JayZ - the key to this all is DJ Khaled.

Consider this theory for just a second. DJ Khaled has a wife who's brother is a drug dealer (this is a fact, you can find an article where he was murdered by 5 men). DJ Khaled is a known devout Muslim, and in one interview, he says he doesn't eat his wife's pussy because man is king. I believe this was a hint towards extremist Muslim views.

I believe there were certain US government officials that knew about these connections. Particularly, I think he had a way to get in touch with Al-Tuhamy Mohamed Khaled. I think Trump and these US officials used this to develop a backchannel to Tohami Khaled. In 2013, Tohami Khaled is wanted by the ICC for his crimes against humanity and the war crimes he committed in 2011.

In 2017, the Prosecutor for the ICC's son (Fatou Bensouda) is murdered. 4 months later, she reveals a warrant to the public to make known that Al-Tuhamy Mohamed Khaled is wanted for his arrest. In 2018, Libya approached the ICC to attempt to drop the charges, but they were rejected. From 2017 to 2020, Trump and Mike Pompeo continue to obstruct Fatou Bensouda. Why? I believe she was trying to make it known that Trump is working with this individual, so he used his presidency to suppress her with threats.

Sept 7th 2022, Al-Tuhamy Mohamed Khaled has all charges dropped from the UN for his war crimes due to his ""death due to covid"" that was reported from Libyan officials and an annexed death certificate. All the other information that said this was sufficient enough evidence for his death has been redacted.

Given the timeline of every event (Centra Tech, DJ Khaled's popularity at the time, Al-Tuhamad Mohamad Khaled's arrest warrant, when it went public, etc.), I have reasonable doubt that Tohami Khaled is actually dead. In fact, I believe the money gained from Centra Tech (over $60 million in cryptocurrency seized by the FBI and SEC) was used to bribe or threaten both US or ICC officials and help fake the death of Tohami Khaled.

If you know JayZ and Kanye West as billionaires, we can classify them as the 1%. JayZ certainly knows a lot about drugs, gangs, and crime, and has connections to this. It is entirely possible that Trump used his connections and his drug money to fund bribes, assassinations, and politic to the Presidency of the United States.

I have an absurd amount of research and articles to support this, so please give me some if you believe I'm insane. At this point, I'm dead in the waters without warrants or more resources."|0.71|3|0|3

ESG policy is destroying what we consider modern life with energy being the most egregious and immediate failure of the three nightmare letters, due to the fact that if you fuck up energy management, you fuck up all of what we consider civilization and this is the case right now.

The current energy crisis unfolding the world over, due to these deranged cultist and utopian ideals regarding ‚Äúrenewables‚Äùwill be the end of what you consider a comfortable and familiar daily existence and this has already arrived for many.

Germany specifically and Europe as whole are just beginning to get the tip of the massive dick that‚Äôs going to fuck them this winter and all nations are going to get it in due time if they aren‚Äôt experiencing it already.

Oil, natural gas, coal and uranium (in no specific order) plays are severely undervalued given how deep world markets are in renewables and ‚Äúgreen‚Äù plays.

I will speak quickly and broadly and say that the energy sources that are currently being demonized by powerful lobbyists, activists and politicians are the base of our daily lives and civilization as a whole and they always will be, with occasional change ups as new technologies prove effective.

Whether you play options or are a value investor, bet against this trend in any creative way you see fit.

Like with Jim Cramer, whatever ESG zealots invest in, do the opposite: INVERSE ESG

One section that covers most of the bases.

&gt;It appeared that Cohen, the billionaire founder of Chewy, the ‚ÄúAmazon for pets,‚Äù was using the same playbook he‚Äôd applied to the video-game retailer GameStop. In early 2021, Cohen led an activist campaign to resurrect the company‚Äôs left-for-dead stock, inspiring retail investors on Reddit to send its share price soaring and, in the process, blowing up a hedge fund or two that had shorted GameStop. With Cohen‚Äôs investment, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had officially become a meme stock.

&gt;After an initial pop on the news of Cohen‚Äôs involvement, its share price sank back down, dipping below $5 in July. But in August, when Cohen had to redisclose his position in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond owing to a change in the company‚Äôs total amount of shares, the apes on Reddit interpreted it to mean Cohen had gone bullish again on the company ‚Äî despite the fact that he hadn‚Äôt traded any shares in months. The filings once again showed that Cohen owned far-out-of-the-money call options on Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, essentially wagering that the stock would soar above $80. It was old news, but Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stock jumped 70 percent following the disclosures.

&gt;Retail investors had played right into Cohen‚Äôs hands. By the end of the following day, he had sold all of his stock, according to a subsequent filing. The revelation sent the company‚Äôs stock crashing, while Cohen walked away with a $68 million profit.

&gt;Now, some investors are wondering if Cohen had planned this from the beginning ‚Äî exploiting his reign as meme king to execute what critics are calling a pump-and-dump scheme. The out-of-the-money options struck investors as particularly suspicious. ‚ÄúWhy are you buying $80 calls with the stock under $20 if you‚Äôre not looking to manipulate the stock?‚Äù says Marc Cohodes, a famed short-seller.

&gt;It‚Äôs hard to allege Cohen committed a securities violation on the basis of simply making accurate regulatory disclosures and legally selling stock on the open market ‚Äî which has made many on Wall Street all the more upset. ‚ÄúThe way he did it reeks of a pump and dump, just reeks of it,‚Äù says Whitney Tilson, the CEO of Empire Financial Research, who filed a complaint with the SEC alleging Cohen engaged in securities manipulation through a pump-and-dump scheme. ‚ÄúThis has been going on for forever ‚Äî Ryan Cohen just came up with a clever, innovative, nefarious twist.‚Äù

&gt;In the days following Cohen‚Äôs sale, however, the true extent of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond‚Äôs woes became clear. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs highly problematic for Ryan Cohen to place individuals on the board, dump all of his shares, and then the next day we learn that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond has hired restructuring experts and now they‚Äôre engaged in some financial difficulties,‚Äù says Daniel Taylor, a Wharton professor who specializes in fraud."|0.47|0|0|0

Overall a really tough day to trade. Not only that but the VIX was rising most of the day (which to be expected with CPI tomorrow) and Apple hit 4.3%+ at one point and while Apple was going for ATH it seemed like SPY struggled almost all day. Definitely an interesting disconnected day. I traded until about 1130 and after that I refused to touch it. I didn‚Äôt really see any of my idea trade setups today either with the chop and random little dumps SPY would have.

I am going to keep this TA super short and simple and to the point.. why? Well because in the end while technical 100% matter and eventually tomorrow regardless of a big dump or a big pop SPY will find a key level to hug to but until then its just a guess. So lets look at some bigger ‚Äútargets.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ryn3jouoohn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a30c097f2c88154cd936ba0ec57036828e36fda4

Currently credit Suisse released a report that they think CPI will be 7.9% and forecast/ consensus is 8.1% and Cleveland fed CPI nowcast which is usually pretty close is predicting 8.22%. Overall we should expect to see CPI hit that 7.9 to 8.2% range tomorrow in my opinion. 

So If we get a bullish CPI reading tomorrow then most likely we will see a big green open. The biggest openings we usually have from CPI at 1.4 to 1.8%. So on average we can say a 1.5% +/- opening regardless of reading. 

So if we get a good CPI reading tomorrow we should expect an opening closer to 417. Which would be pretty huge as this would put us right at key 417.3 level resistance. From there that will be a big fight that rages on. 

If we break through that resistance then we should look for 421.22 gap fill.  

However, if we get a bad CPI and expect a -1.5% opening we could see 404.8. This would be significant as it would put us back below key level support if 405.3.

Breaking below key 405.3 we could attempt a gap fill down to 400.86. 

Overall we can expect high volatility and a good CPI or a bad CPI in my opinion will guide the markets for the next week until FOMC..

Its hard to give a sold TA based prediction here but in my opinion good cpi + 75bps hike= rally‚Ä¶. Bad cpi and 75bps= rally‚Ä¶ bad cpi and anything but 75bps hike= dump‚Ä¶ bad cpi and anything but 75bps hike= dump

Apple broke through that major resistance from the early august top and that should continue to open up the upside for Apple and the rest of the market as long as CPI comes in strong tomorrow. 

We should expect a solid 3% +/- from Apple tomorrow with a possible range of 168.3 to 158.5.

Not surprisingly we did see a small green day on the VIX today despite SPY in sell off mode. But that should be expected with CPI tomorrow and the increased ‚Äúfear‚Äù in the market. 

I know this post is not like most of my posts but honestly there is little reason to do a complete full blown technical based report when we know that CPI is going to break all norms and cause a bigger move. Tomorrow will be back to your normally scheduled TA‚Ä¶ 

The question is what will CPI be? What way will the markets move based on that CPI and what will markets do once they open? 

10% challenge-

As I had said today was one of those days where the way spy and the markets moved none of my ideal setups were hitting and if I had wanted to enter a trade I would have needed to break my rules. I was able to get 3 small trades in but that was about it. After about 1130 I just refused to trade it.

I just wanted to share some charts I colored on to show you that GME is going to have some gains this week and I'm hoping that maybe some of you degenerates can make some tendies.  None of this is financial advice, I'm very regarded and eat crayons.  GME is about to have a positive crossover on the 1 day MACD, everytime GME has had a crossover there has been a significant increase in price.

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0fbt4ywnhn91.png?width=1056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d4786692e4bce816e6b5f8713871fa6a9869a00)

The main take away from this is highlighted by the purple circle.  Looks like there is a golden cross headed to a positive cross over on the 1 day MACD. The last cross over was on 8/3 and the stonk went from 36 -&gt; 48. Another one on 7/11 when it went 31 -&gt;40. This cross over that's about to happen looks very similiar to the one on 5/24 when it went 21 -&gt;37.  Positive crossover's on the 1 day MACD for GME has been a reliable indicator for me to tell when gme is about to go up. This positive momentum is confirmed by the other indicators I use.

Parabolicsar ( yellow arrow) - flipped to postive = this is bullish

Stochastics (orange arrow) - has had a golden cross, is going up and diverging = also bullish

Accumulation/ distribution (pink arrow) - is going up

Aroon (Blue) - is also going up

&amp;#x200B;

Overall - GME has been in a down trend since 8/16, is currently oversold and is about to have a positive cross over on the 1 day MACD. This means stonk goes up and is confirmed by other indicators being super bullish. I'd like to zoom out to show you the stonk on a macro level

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the 1 week chart](https://preview.redd.it/ccgsw7u1ohn91.png?width=1023&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0431f2a1e730c280abcaf966b621c9c3560a8e3)

The main take away is highlighted by the purple circle.  There is about to be a golden cross on stochastics.  This tells me that GME likely has found a bottom and will be going up. The last chart I color on for you is the 4 hour chart.

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the 4 hour chart](https://preview.redd.it/1cr7b2e4ohn91.png?width=1037&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=106df95168681dcbd41b71cece3f90974d0d7b34)

This is showing what GME is headed into for tomorrow.  Highlighted by the purple circle, GME is at a critical resistance right now at 30.  With the set up right now, I speculate that resistance won't hold long.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lz726crbohn91.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e7876c3171a06e71b933625527052fa3ea99587

TLDR: GME is about to have a positive crossover on the 1 day MACD.  This means GME is about to go up

t3_xcm3c6|1663011635|wallstreetbets|A great, gay ape.|"I had a childhood friend pass recently. Young guy, early 30s. He was a harmless fellow. A vegan. He played on a flag football team. He was a unicycle hobbyist. We believed he suffered from low T. In many ways he epitomized what this sub represents. This man was not only full-blown autistic, he was completely retarded. 

I won‚Äôt go into the details of how my friend crossed over, but I‚Äôll just share that it involved him on a bicycle and a speeding ice cream truck driver. The velocity and impact of the two was enough to activate spirit mode. In addition to his other hobbies, my friend was also a member of a band and at his funeral they played some of his band‚Äôs favorite songs. As soon as the music started playing I saw some attendees fighting back tears. It got emotional very quickly‚Ä¶I turned to my buddy who was at the funeral with me and whispered, ‚ÄúWow, ya know‚Ä¶ this music is fucking awful. It‚Äôs no wonder we all refused to listen to it.‚Äù He agreed, ‚ÄúFor sure, this sounds like a dozen cats getting gang raped.‚Äù

While most of the crowd was fighting back tears of sadness, my friend and I were now both fighting back tears of uncontrollable laughter. People were audibly sobbing all around us while we were laughing so hard that we started to cry. We appeared inconsolable and strangers started coming up to us to share in our grief.

Our friend was on a few spectrums. The autistic spectrum, most notably. We also suspected he was firmly on the LGBTQ spectrum. Of course, we didn‚Äôt care about either. We were far more concerned with his highly secretive investment strategies (more on that later) and the fact he rode a unicycle.

I recalled a conversation I had with him once. I was picking him up to go somewhere and when I pulled into his driveway he was riding his unicycle and juggling old bowling pins like a real-life circus clown. He hopped in my car and we pulled out of the driveway and I asked him, ‚ÄúDude, why don‚Äôt you wear a helmet? Aren‚Äôt you worried you‚Äôre going to land on your head one day?‚Äù My friend, always with an odd yet astute observation, responded, ‚ÄúOnly rich people wear bicycle helmets. They don‚Äôt want their life to end, it‚Äôs too good. Helmets aren‚Äôt for Poors. All Poors know this.‚Äù

He pointed this fact out while we drove through the poorer outskirts of a beach town and then eventually towards the expensive beach homes. He was right, only the Poors rode helmet-free and every WASP had on a goofy bicycle helmet while pedaling 5 mph along the flat beach roads. 

I was reminded of his helmet theory because a picture of him helmetless and with a Special Olympic-sized grin just came across the TV. His family had arranged to sync someone‚Äôs phone to the smart TV. The TV screen was automatically shifting from sentimental picture to sentimental picture. The ceremony was over at this point and everyone was now just noshing on hors d'oeuvres and enjoying the ‚Äúcelebration of life‚Äù when all of a sudden my deceased friend‚Äôs grandmother let out a sound that was part shriek, part I‚Äôve-fallen-and-I-can‚Äôt-get-up. 

We had turned to see what was wrong and then suddenly the entire crowd of roughly 40 people simultaneously saw my deceased friend blowing another dude while dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow at what appeared to be a gay Halloween bash. The next picture elicited an even greater gasp from the crowd - my friend, in what appeared to be the back of an adult store with shelves adorned with X-rated DVDs, was kneeling blindfolded while an elderly Asian man stood naked and erect beside him. The auto-shuffle had inadvertently entered deep into his own personal erotica album. A third photo appeared and before anyone could make out what is was, the TV abruptly shut off. The gasps and chatter among the attendees continued for another minute or two. My buddy eventually turned to me and said, ‚ÄúAre you at all surprised by this?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúNot at all. I‚Äôd be more interested to know what stocks he was long. That‚Äôs the real secret he kept from us.‚Äù My friend agreed that we needed to see if our deceased friend‚Äôs twin brother could open his WeBull app with FaceID. 

An hour or so had passed and we decided it was time to approach the twin brother, who, somehow was entirely opposite from his deceased brother in every possible way besides his physical appearance. The twin was successful, married, wore a nice Breitling and drove an M-series. He definitely was the type of guy to wear a helmet. Luckily for us, he was more than willing to unlock WeBull as he too wanted further insight into the mind of his unfathomably autistic brother.

The screen unlocked. Then the app. And then we saw it, an account that had only one open option position and was long only one stock. The option position - fifteen SPY DEC ‚Äò24 $250P. Our friend was anticipating a full blown market crash. There was one stock, however, he liked very much. He was bullish on $TLRY. His cost basis was $16.42 and he owned 1,777 shares. Our friend had been bag holding Tilray shares since the first half of 2019. He had YOLO‚Äôd $29,178.34 total (likely every dollar he had in the world) and had been DCA‚Äôing over the last two years. Today his shares are worth only ~$6,000. He was down roughly 80% at time of death. We all looked at each other, the twin brother included, and started cracking up. And then silently we all had the same thought - did this gay ape know something we didn‚Äôt? We agreed to each open a small Gay4Tilray position in his memory.

If you know any austistic, gay, poor apes, hug them and remind them - Poors can wear helmets too.

TLDR: Autistic man gets outed at his own funeral. YOLO‚Äôd life savings into $TLRY. Down roughly 80% at time of death.

With only 78 trading days left in 2022, Wall Street‚Äôs brightest minds are still split on where the S&amp;P will end the year ‚Äî with live year-end S&amp;P 500 price targets ranging from 52-week highs to 52-week lows. And by the end of September, we‚Äôll likely have a clearer picture of who‚Äôs going to come out on top. 

**September Double-Header: CPI Report and FOMC**

After Jerome Powell‚Äôs hawkish Jackson Hole warning, all eyes are on these two September events, which some analysts believe are likely to set the tone for the rest of 2022. While there will be additional FOMC meetings to come, the one scheduled on September 21st is the only one remaining where the market expects another 75 basis point rate hike. With the third quarter already flying by, Wall Street‚Äôs most bearish and bullish analysts have a lot of ground to cover if they want their predictions of double-digit S&amp;P moves to come true by the end of the year. But they aren‚Äôt backing down: Here‚Äôs how bulls (and bears) think they‚Äôll get there.

**The Bull Case: Falling Inflation, Economic Resilience, and ‚ÄúBaked-In Bad-News‚Äù**

CPI Reports are lagging indicators ‚Äî meaning September‚Äôs CPI Report will reflect August inflation. This has some analysts, like Bull-Team-Captain Tom Lee doing the math. In a September sit-down with CNBC‚Äôs Scott Wapner, Lee told The Judge that the September CPI Report was likely to show inflation well-below expectations. 

**Tom Lee‚Äôs 2022 Predictions Thus Far:** 

Predicted that the first half of the year would be ‚Äútreacherous‚Äù.

Predicted a summer bounce.

Predicted that the summer bounce would take us back to a retest of $3,900, which would hold.

Fundstrat‚Äôs official 2022 S&amp;P 500 price target: $4,800 (+18%) ‚Äî a return to the all-time high.

While a round-trip back to all-time highs may sound far-fetched, Tom Lee isn‚Äôt the only bull bold enough to make the call. JPMorgan‚Äôs Chief Economist Marko Kolanovic and BMO Capital Markets‚Äô Chief Investment Strategist Brian Belski are both on board with matching $4,800 year-end S&amp;P 500 price targets. 

The ‚Äúfalling inflation‚Äù, positive CPI piece of the bull case: We know that one of the top drivers of high inflation has been the soaring price of gasoline. And we know that it fell dramatically throughout the month of August. While energy prices aren‚Äôt something that the Fed has direct control over, this can have a broadly positive effect on other key measures of inflation. For instance the price of food, retail goods, airfare, the cost of synthetic materials like plastics that are involved in petroleum and refining ‚Äî and much, much more. 

The ‚Äúeconomic &amp; consumer resilience‚Äù piece of the bull case: The cause-and-effect relationship between falling gas and the consumer extends far past decreasing inflation ‚Äî it‚Äôs largely a tailwind for the broader economy. And consumers are already catching on. After three consecutive months of weakening consumer confidence, August 30th depicted a big bounce. Americans are ‚Äúless pessimistic in both their current and future economic outlooks‚Äù, giving the most positive read on consumer confidence since May. What‚Äôs driving it? You guessed it: falling gas prices. Whilst analyzing the results of the most recent consumer confidence survey, one economist said,

‚ÄúExpectations are more sensitive to movements in gas prices. We expect a further increase in September as the lagged effect of the drop in gas prices kicks in.‚Äù 

A strengthening outlook on the economy mixed with falling inflation could indicate that the Fed‚Äôs path to a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù is less narrow than what the market has already priced-in. That note about what is and isn‚Äôt priced-in is the last important piece of the puzzle for bulls. 

**What‚Äôs ‚ÄúPriced-In‚Äù to the Market?**

The Fed Fund Futures market is pricing-in 80% odds of a 75 basis-point hike at the September FOMC meeting. If Powell was telling the truth when he said that the Fed would consider ‚Äúthe totality of the data‚Äù before making their decision about whether to hike 50 or 75 basis points, then a significant drop in inflation could set the stage for a dovish surprise. 

Despite a VIX reading that is running below average for the calendar year, bearish sentiment is at a fever pitch. Last week, Wall Street crowded into put options at the highest rate since 2008, racking up the highest total put premium in more than two decades. Whether this was outright bearish betting, or an influx of ‚Äúcatastrophe insurance‚Äù, one thing is for sure: investors have taken a highly bearish position. If the market starts to move higher, the high quantity of ‚Äúcash on the sidelines‚Äù and the market‚Äôs lack of bullish positioning could create a stampede of positive momentum ‚Äî at least, according to the bulls.

**Good Morning!**

 

Unfortunately posting daily premarket sometimes becomes redundant since the bulk of the moves have been happening intraday. But today is definitely a day to look at!

SPY sitting above 406 support  
410-412 resistance overhead.

As we trade at 408 in the PM we're sort of trading in no mans land but we must remain bullish in the short term above 406

 It's also important to remain objective, not emotionally responsive to this rally we've seen because we must still keep in mind that SEPTEMBER IS A VERY BEARISH MONTH.

Therefore it is important to remain bullish in the short term but it makes sense to start scaling into shorts for a few months out =)

We also have CPI and PPI data coming out this week.  
Trade light, pile it on after we see proper direction.

t3_xcazlt|1662984213|wallstreetbets|The DOJ says Google illegally dominates the search market by paying billions of dollars to other companies. Do you agree that it is illegal?|"Google pays billions of dollars to other companies -- Apple, Samsung Electronics, etc. -- to keep its search as the default option on phones and in browsers, something the Department of Justice (DOJ) believes creates an illegal dominance over the search market.

Deals like this ensure companies like Apple stay out of the search business. The practice has gone on for years. Google, at one point, paid Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion annually to appear as the default search engine on iPhones and other Apple devices, according to a law suit filed in 2020.

DOJ attorney Kenneth Dintzer didn‚Äôt disclose the amount Google spends to remain the default search engine on browsers and U.S. mobile phones, but described it as ‚Äúenormous numbers,‚Äù reports Bloomberg.

‚ÄúGoogle invests billions securing defaults, knowing people won‚Äôt change them,‚Äù Dintzer told Judge Amit Mehta during a hearing in Washington, admitting that Google buys ‚Äúdefault exclusivity because defaults matter a lot.‚Äù

In 2019, Google began giving Android users in Europe a choice to select a provider to power a search box on their device's home screen, and as the default in Chrome when installed. The changes complied with a competitive European Union ruling. The EU fined Google, saying it had an unfair advantage by pre-installing its Chrome browser and Google search app on Android smartphones and notebooks.

The change gave users with a phone running the Android operating system and Chrome browser an option to customize and personalize their device, choose and change their search engine based on their preference. It included selecting the apps to download.

Google, for example, added private, decentralized search engine Presearch as a default option on all new and factory-reset Android devices in the U.K. and Europe.

Since Google added Presearch 2021, its daily searches have grown from about 200,000 a day to more than 4 million, said Alex Carrabre, head of growth at Presearch. ‚ÄúAt the peak it was 6 million per day in the past 20 months,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just in the Europe economic area.‚Äù

Carrabre estimates Android has about 70% of smartphone market share in Europe, which means there‚Äôs strong potential for the fledgling search engine to grow its user base.

Google‚Äôs private contracts with companies like Apple, and Samsung form the basis of the DOJ‚Äôs antitrust lawsuit, which alleges the company has sought to maintain its online search monopoly in violation of antitrust laws.

The trial isn‚Äôt expected to start until next year. Thursday‚Äôs hearing was a daylong tutorial where each side laid out its views on Google‚Äôs business.

Apple Inc. isn't sending Globalstar's business to the moon, but near-Earth orbit might just be enough.

With the unveiling of its iPhone 14 family on Wednesday, Apple finally confirmed a longstanding rumor that the devices will be able to connect directly to satellites. The feature, called Emergency SOS, will allow iPhone 14 models to message from remote locations not covered by traditional cellular infrastructure. Apple says the service launches in November and will be free to iPhone 14 buyers for two years. It didn't specify what it might cost after that.

Globalstar confirmed in a filing Wednesday that it will be operating the service through a partnership with Apple. Under that agreement, Apple will cover 95% of the capital expenditures made by Globalstar to build up its network, including new satellites, to provide the service. It will require Globalstar to allocate 85% of its ""current and future network capacity"" to support the service, which analyst Mike Crawford of B. Riley describes as ""in one fell swoop converting an underutilized asset to a productive asset.""

The deal will include service fees and potential bonus payments, allowing Globalstar to project total revenue in a range of $185 million to $230 million for next year and $250 million to $310 million for 2026, which is expected to be the first full year that all of the company's new satellites are operational. Even the low end of the near-term target would be a record high for the satellite-service provider, representing a gain of 44% above the annual revenue Globalstar has averaged for the past three years. Globalstar notably broke from the traditionally dry language of SEC filings to describe the deal as transformational.

The reality still seems to have cost Globalstar some altitude, with the stock sliding 19% on Thursday. Some of that might have been sparked by a tweet from Elon Musk, who claimed to have ""some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity."" Starlink is a satellite service operated by Mr. Musk's SpaceX, which announced a deal last month with T-Mobile to launch a text-based service by the end of next year.

The limited nature of the Apple-Globalstar service might have cooled some enthusiasm. It is designed for emergency texting only, as opposed to providing a more typical smartphone experience in the wild. Apple noted at Wednesday's event that the phone would need to be pointed directly at a satellite to work, and that even light foliage could make such a text take a few minutes to send. Still, Globalstar's stock remains 17% above the price it was fetching in late August 2021, when rumors of a deal with Apple first surfaced.

That might still seem like lofty territory for what was once a financially distressed company operating in the high-risk satellite space. But the Apple deal becoming public should help Globalstar establish a stronger connection with investors. The company hasn't even hosted a quarterly earnings call since early 2020, which not coincidentally is when it first started describing in its filings a project with an unnamed customer to assess a ""potential service."" Globalstar said Wednesday that it will host an in-person investor meeting in mid-November to provide additional details on its business and address questions.

Its timing is good, as more satellite-to-smartphone projects come to fruition. In addition to T-Mobile's venture with SpaceX, the Globalstar rival Iridium announced in July that it has entered a development agreement with an unnamed company for a smartphone service that it expects to complete by the end of the year. Ric Prentiss of Raymond James wrote Thursday that the total addressable market ""for satellite-smartphone off-the-grid connectivity is quite large with room for several initiatives globally.""

iPhone 14 users might not be FaceTiming from the top of Kilimanjaro, but Apple has ensured Globalstar a place in the sky above."|0.75|21|0|21

# Why is this gobbledygook relevant?

The Federal Reserve creates money and uses it to buy bonds. They do this to push interest rates down and to put more money into the economy. Low rates mean people can borrow more, spend more, and afford higher prices. More spending and higher prices mean people feel rich, and businesses hire new employees.

But, if prices rise too quickly or people borrow too much, the Fed does the opposite. It sells the bonds it has and then destroys the money it receives. These sales push interest rates up and take money out of the economy. Higher rates mean people can't borrow or spend as much and must pay lower prices. It makes people feel poorer than before, stops them from being able to spend as much, and makes businesses trim employment.

In addition to this, the Fed borrows and lends to banks. If a bank doesn't have enough money for a day or two, it can borrow from the Fed. If it has too much, it can lend to the Fed. A group of people who work for the Fed, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), decide the interest rate that the Fed will pay for, or demand of, these short-term loans.

The Fed does these because they believe in two objectives: first, a low and stable inflation rate is good for the economy, and second, that minimising unemployment is desirable.

# FAQs

W**hy do you look at weekly average balance sheet data instead of the Wednesday level?**

It takes time for asset settlement to occur. The holdings on any given day will fluctuate wildly‚Äîespecially given that the Fed owns almost $9trn of assets. The weekly average is smoother and more indicative of the monetary policy trend.

What's up fucker's and fuckette's,

\[Background\] So I've posted a few discussion threads on this sub where I (subtly) suck Disney's dick and try to see any cons or disagreements people have about the companies financials &amp; overall strength . . .  besides the usual 'groomer' comments, I can never really get a serious viewpoint on how/why I should stay away from this company, so please, hold nothing back if you think what I'm saying is complete bullshit. 

I'm putting my dick on the table and telling you regards to buck up and load up on some Disney.

D23 just happened this weekend and although there wasn't anything crazy revealed, I believe that a lot of their ideas and upcoming media can finally start bringing that creative edge Disney is known for. . . wishful thinking but go fuck yourself.

Now for the stuff you sick fucks want to hear: There is absolutely no way people are going to stop visiting the parks or consuming Disney media unless a nuclear war starts. Even then, little shit ball kids are going to beg their parents for the mouse. There's really nothing I can say that hasn't been said on another DIS dick riding post.

For my financial investors out there: Disney is slightly recession proof in my eyes. At least in southern california where I live, people will literally forego their rent for the month in order to pay for their 'Magic Keyholder' pass. Disney is slowly phasing these 'unfavorable guests' out seeing as how they go to the park every week without spending money where it really counts: Merchandising. Disney loves a good consumer who doesn't frequent the park and will use up their savings to get their kids $40 Mickey ears, but I digress. Looking at their financials for the past two quarters looks like their on the right path to showing shareholders that people will spend their money at the parks or on their media even when they really shouldn't be. I believe that as long as Disney+ continues to expand internationally and maintain the significantly lower price than netflix, D+ is going to be able to grow company revenue where cable and their linear networks have been lagging. 

Until China fucks up the rest of the world economy, I also believe that Disney will continue to see a steady flow of visitors to their parks outside of the US as well as a steady stream of tourists to US parks. 

People want to hate the new CEO Bob Chapek, but honestly the bald fuck seems to be reminding these entitled fucks that visiting Disney is a 'luxury' not a right.

Allright listen up retards, and listen well. I'm an OG and I have some hard to swallow truth for you. This sub has been overtaken by nefarious actors, bots and actual retards since the GME drama. Squeeze this. Squeeze that. Squeeze my fucking dick and fuck betting on lame has-been retail companies and fucking silver. 
 
It's time we reclaim this sub and start posting proper autistic bets and DD again.
 
Now, for those of you cowboys with at least a braincell remaining, boys do I got a bet for you. Something asymetrical and long term. *ewww, long term*, I hear you say? Well, perhaps I can change your mind about that!
 
As many here may already know, AST SpaceMobile ($ASTS) is a pre-revenue company aiming to deliver world-wide satellite-based direct-to-cellphone broadband. That means 2G/3G/4G/5G all over the world, from space, on the device in your hands right now. No more dead spots.
 
I could talk for hours of the benefits and desirability of this service, the adressable market of billions, their partnerships and MOUs for distribution through cell-phone service providers, their 2400 patents, their amazing CEO and how he personally funded ASTS' beginnings, the marvels of technology they have built, how stupidly faster than GSAT IRDM AAPL and starlink it will be, how they launched yesterday their first satellite and are about to demonstrate their tech in the coming weeks, etc., but I'm going to take you by the sentiments. *Let's talk money*.
 
ASTS plans to deploy 168 sats. Sats will cost somewhere around 16M and launches 5M. Each sat will be able to give 1.8M GB per month. 
 
*Yes, but how much is a GB of space internet worth?* I hear you ask?
 
Well I kid you not, Globalstar and Iridium are managing to sell their GB for more than *2000$* a pop. That's fucking right. And they're slow af, not even comparable.
 
Now, for the sake of pessimism (üåàüêª), let's imagine ASTS and their partners decide to sell at a much lower price and ASTS gets half. Say 20$ per GB, so ASTS gets 10$. And again for the sake of pessimism (üåàüêª), let's say they sell only 10% of their capacity.
 
Once the full constellation is up (likely before 2030) that means a yearly revenue of 10$x168satsx1.8M GBx12 monthsx10% = **3.63B$**

Yeah, *that's fucking right* **.** My üåàüêª case is 3.63B$ per year for a constellation that will cost about the same only once to build. They may *very well* be able to sell *a lot more* at a *much higher* price. I'll let you do the math and come up with stupidly high valuations by yourselves.
 
If we give that a 10 years valuation that's 36B$. Currently stock is trading at 10.76$ with a 1.97B$ market cap. 
 
That means a 2030 share price of **196.7$** or 18.3 times today's price share.
 
So here's the bet. **&gt;**18.3x in 8 years if ASTS succeeds, or zero if they fail.
 
Position: Long shares, warrants, 2024 leaps, and other calls.

The puts and calls were bought, lottos and longs together. The bears hoped for a big miss, in hopes of avoiding a fat lump of coal. The bulls hoped for a soft reading, in hopes of starting the santa rally early. The bears and bulls nestled themselves all snug in their beds‚Ä¶ with visions of lotto wins dancing in their heads. 

Note- this is a revised and updated CPI document‚Ä¶ I deleted the previous one as a lot has changed and I felt like it was a disservice keeping that one up.

**Previous CPI trends and data analysis**

Of the last 8 CPI days.. we have seen SPY open up red 5 out of 8 times and of those 5 times 4 out of the 5 times have been &gt;1% red. Of the 3 out of 8 times that have been green two have opened less than 1% green and one opened 1.8% green. 

Of the last 8 CPIs the two days before CPI releases is averaging a total drop from open to close of  -0.75%... however, if we look at the last five CPIs (April, May, June and July) we are averaging a two day drop of -2.19%.

Now when we look at the previous CPI we must look at the way the markets sentiment of CPI has changed. Markets used to see CPI as a big scary thing with no stopping or slowing insight. Even worse markets used to not know how the fed would react to CPI readings with their rate hikes or if there was a potential for a fed pivot. 

With the fed being clear in continued rate hikes (clear on 75bps regardless next) the markets in my opinion care less about what CPI will actually be. I believe instead of seeing a April, May, June and July red we are about to see a big green much like August CPI. 

Comparing the last 5 CPIs which averaged a 2 day drop of about -2.19% to the last CPI which had a drop of only 0.52% over the two days‚Ä¶ when we look at Fridays (which was day 1 of 2 before CPI release) we already put in a 1.55% green day. 

Of the two days before CPI dating back to march this is the biggest green day (individually) dating back to March. 

**Intraday movement the day before CPI**

The January 11th, February 10th, March 9th and August 10th (days before CPI) were all considered flat days. However, When we look at the four CPI days (April, May, June and July) all four of them have had pretty significant dumps from about 1pm to close. If you had bought puts around 1pm almost all four of these days you would have ended up extremely profitable. 

The average drop of those four CPIs from 1pm till EOD is 1.425% with the smallest being 0.8% in April and the most being 2.3% in June. 

Intraday puts are almost certainly the play once the morning chop is over‚Ä¶ only if there is a bigger 1pm sell off that starts, however, when we look at the last CPI on August 10th if the sentiment is still bullish going into CPI we might not see the sell off. 

**What will CPI be? Are we bullish or bearish?**

If we look at July to August releases of CPI we saw a decrease from 9.1% to 8.5% for a total drop of 0.6%. Now the very interesting thing about Augusts release is that this was the first time we saw the forecast and the consensus differ from each other. Not only that this was the first time we had seen the consensus be revised to a lower number prior to the release of CPI (it was edited just under a week before hand). 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7g9bbmp8fbn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0716f198f2fa3765346313d66fcabaac45389fa5

When we look at the current projection for consensus/ forecast of CPI you can see its currently rated at 8.1%. Now the significance of this is that these reads did not come out till Thursday and Friday. The odd thing about this CPI is that the markets had no idea what to expect for CPI this weak. My opinion has changed on why. 

We were in a 4 week long sell off (it ended last week officially with the 3 green days to close the week). I had initially interrupted the fact that consensus and forecast were unavailable, JPOW Jackson hole speech (and his Thursday Q/A) along with the fact that literally every single fed member has said and continues to say ‚Äúinflation has not peaked‚Äù that they were purposefully withholding the CPI consensus and forecast to as close to CPI as possible to prevent a June sell off, however, no I view it differently. 

Lets objectively think about the market for a second here‚Ä¶ I know its hard but lets do it together‚Ä¶ What does the market care about? They care about KNOWING ahead of time what is going to happen and then when that thing does happen they care about it being the SAME as they expected. Markets want to naturally go up. It takes a great deal more of effort to cause a sell off in the market then it does to cause a rally in the markets. The markets do not care about the economy, the world, you, me, your mom, your brother, Joe Byron, the queen, no one‚Ä¶ it gives no fucks‚Ä¶ its like Switzerland its neutral. 

So when you realize that and you look at things from that perspective you can change your idea of what to expect next. Yes 8.1% inflation is dogwater and that sucks when you look at the fact that inflation is out of control‚Ä¶ but markets already know this‚Ä¶ and it doesn‚Äôt really effect the day to day of the markets. Even looking at earnings over the last two quarters where inflation has been 1%+ higher then current inflation‚Ä¶ earnings were still pretty okay. If that didn‚Äôt drop earnings what will? My point is‚Ä¶ markets need a NEW reason to sell off and I don‚Äôt think they have it. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/puocgt89fbn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fe4aafe3d68b1b87d4cbfff3bfeaca1add4ecaf

What did JPOW say during his Jackson Hole speech and did he say during Thursdays Q&amp;A? There is going to continue to be aggressive rate hikes regardless of what the CPI rating is. They will NOT make the same mistake the previous feds have where they stopped rate hikes too soon. So here is a scenario to chew on‚Ä¶ If the markets have already priced in 91% chance of a 75BPS hike and it would be pretty unlikely that inflation would increase high enough without the consensus/ forecast catching it‚Ä¶ What if regardless of what CPI comes at markets STILL rally? Why? Because does CPI really matter in the grand scheme of things? Honestly no it doesn‚Äôt (to the market) all this number does is tell us what the fed is going to do rate hike wise which DOES actually matter to the markets‚Ä¶ So if CPI comes in over 8.5% does it really matter? We are getting a 75bps hike regardless‚Ä¶ Think about it‚Ä¶ 

**Why did they hold the consensus/ forecast for so long?**

This is where I go back to the psyops of the markets that always seem to surround CPI. Remember the rogue leaked CPI report that called for crazy high inflation in July? When that report hit all the algos tore the market apart and sold us off. What this did was ‚Äúreset‚Äù the algos and when inflation came in high BUT less then the fake report the market rallied intraday. 

So this is my conspiracy theory psyops of why they held off. If you see that article above and if you have looked at the put/ call ratio for the next 30-45 DTE people are beyond jacked to the tits with puts. I mean heavily heavily invested in puts‚Ä¶ Most of that OI has been put back on in August/ September with this 4 week sell off. In my opinion the markets were already running too hot and it wouldn‚Äôt have been sustainable for us to really hit 440s then have a good CPI to then hit ATHS. That would be pretty crazy and is what would have happened based off that rally we had‚Ä¶ markets sold off on purpose on the idea that CPI was gonna break us. Look at the media for the last month the media all of a sudden became the doom and gloom patrol. Everything was the bottoms not in, we aren‚Äôt gonna see ATH, this bear markets gonna be a bad one, the crash of 2008 is coming, etc. etc. etc. That fueled this sell off and now its being tacticfully slowed by that bullish consensus/ forecast (purposefully lately added to trap EVERYONE deep in puts). Remember the market is good at wrecking the most people at once. There is no way they are going to let all that crazy high put OI expire ITM‚Ä¶ 

I believe CPI comes in bullish we rally, FOMC drops that 75bps hike and we rally till end of October till earnings start. 

**So whats the play? How am I going to play CPI?**

Remembering like FOMC I trade off the data I have analyzed and what the highest probability risk to reward is‚Ä¶  

If we were to see the president or the feds front run CPI with a presser I would feel even more confident in puts and a bigger CPI miss. Historically whenever the president or feds step in to front run CPI release the day before (so that‚Äôs tomorrow Monday) its cause its gonna be hot hot hot! IF we have radio silence tomorrow for Biden we are good to go. 

Now if you follow my TA you know I was hella bearish last week but im riding that sweet sweet bull train. 

Taking previous CPI (since its really our only big green open to analyze properly). April did open a 0.71% green but its nothing like the big CPIs which are 1-2% +/-.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jrbg8nx9fbn91.png?width=572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fef56db1d7dadfd28df7f168eea1f94e64a3c7d

Don‚Äôt worry DD did the work for you on what the best option to play is IF you want the best risk to reward‚Ä¶. So assuming your treating this as a TRUE lotto‚Ä¶ which means it‚Äôs a VERY small sized position compared to normal‚Ä¶ then statistically speaking the SPY 0dte 5 strikes OTM bought at 414pm (or just before close) would be the bigger reward at nearly 300%. Now mind you we don‚Äôt have enough data to really get an average as we only have one big green open (but I expect another one). 

So the interesting thing about this CPI is its being released on a Tuesday‚Ä¶ so that means there are NO 0dte SPY options so we would be left with a 0DTE SPX contract. That 0dte SPX contract did received quite a bit less reward then the SPY 0dte counter parts (peculiar and intriguing). Just for reference I did a 10strike OTM SPX call also and it only rewarded about 296% which is still less than the 0dte spy 5strike call. 

Now keep in mind‚Ä¶ IF you are wrong you are going to get WRECKED with anything OTM. Yes the CPI release IV pump will help some but being that Tuesday is the release and I will utilize SPX I would stick to more of a 3OTM call vs going crazy out of the money‚Ä¶

**My current Game plan** 

Assuming the feds don‚Äôt surprise us with a front run of CPI tomorrow and CPI comes in bullish this is my plan for CPI and FOMC (FOMC analysis and trade breakdown will be posted next weekend). 

Monday September 12th around 414pm= Buy 3strikes OTM SPX Call

Tuesday September 13th within the first 5 minutes of opening= sell call (regardless of profits)

\-One could do a stop loss or trailing stop here but with the volatility I don‚Äôt like my odds of a fill and would rather realize gains then take a chance of getting wrecked.

\-If I am wrong and CPI dumps us if there is anything left on my call I will sell immediately

\*wild card play\* Wednesday DTE calls bought Tuesday before market close to hold till FOMC expecting a big green move.

Tuesday September 20th= calls going into the night before FOMC (more details to come on this) 

Wednesday September 21st= sell calls at open 

Wednesday September 21st= buy calls after the FOMC presser begins (more details to come) 

Note- if obviously im wrong on CPI here and the market does tank us on CPI then I will be revisiting all of this. The one thing that I am nervous about though is a massively green day tomorrow (Monday). I would like to see a red day honestly. A green day tomorrow would be the 4th green day in a row and while yes we can of course do 5 in a row and especially do 5 in a row on a big news day that would leave less upside reward. A red day small or big tomorrow would give me even more confirmation bias.

t3_xbqxbn|1662923603|wallstreetbets|DD - Arrival (ARVL) is due for Start of Production Announcement by end of Q3|"Arrival - a EV SPAC company has been absolutely destroyed this past year (along with most other EV SPACs). However, unlike most other EV startups Arrival has confirmed that they will hit SOP in their Bicester plant by the end of Q3 (In about two weeks).

**The Good:**

SOP is a big deal, and the announcement should cause the SP to bounce. Shares have found a floor around $1.10, with significant resistance at $1.00. The price also just broke out of a descending channel, and is clearly waiting for the announcement to begin a move back up.

**The Bad:**

In their recent earnings Arrival said that they were only going to deliver 20 vans to UPS this year, down from announcing that they were going to produce 600. Unfortunately this info might mean that the SOP announcement won't mean much and won't cause the SP to move one direction or the other.

**The Conspiracy:**

Some of you might remember me from Canoo, where we very strongly suspected a deal with Wal-Mart  long before it happened. Arrival already has a deal with UPS, but their delayed SOP announcement is puzzling. If they're truly only making 20 vans, they could easily announce SOP at any time. With only 20 vans being made by the end of the year, they could basically hand-make each one and still fulfill quota.

In the Q2 earnings, Arrival said:

'*Some of the vans produced this year will go into an Arrival fleet for customer demos and trials and approximately 20 vehicles are expected to be delivered to customers in Q4 2022.*'

While only delivering 20 vans isn't amazing, Arrival never outright said they were only going to **make** 20 vans. The share price took a nosedive on this news, but I believe it has been overplayed. Arrival made a generic statement, and is looking to surprise with numbers to get SP back up.

**The Conspiracy-cy:**

Once again, Arrival could announce SOP at *any* time, and still make their quota. What are they waiting for? There was a recent picture of a presentation for the Saudis on Arrival, as well as their microfactories and composite technology. While this may be a nothing-burger, it is possible that given the very low SP that arrival is in the process of being bought out and we will hear about SOP at the same time as the M/A.

Additionally - the options chain on this stock is very limited in terms of weeklies. With SP sitting around $1, weeklies only go up to $2 or $3. If this runs, there is very little ability for hedging via weekly options and the SP could really move.

**The Plays:**

**Safe:**

Shares are cheap and should give a 20%+ return once SP has been announced. I personally expect us to get back to the $1.50 range at least on the SOP announcement, but $1.30 is a good bet.

**Gamble:**

Jan 2023 $1.50 calls are dirt cheap and could make massive returns if SP moves up to $1.50.

**Degeneracy:**

If you think that an M/A is in the cards soon, October $1.50 calls are $5. A $5bil buyout would net a  **11900% gain.**"|0.81|24|0|24

I got it, when Ryan Cohen bought a 9.8% stake in the company.  Hey, look what happened after he bought GameStop.  This could be the same thing.  Yeah, OK.  Then, I could see why people wanted to jump into Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.

Then, when the stock fell lower following RC's investment.  Sure.  Hell, if Cohen and his masters of financial calculation saw value in this stock at a much higher price, it follows logically that others considered it a great buying opportunity to jump in at an even further discounted price.

And when the short interest started to rise dramatically...Hey, I'm with you there.  Even when the stock roared higher during the squeeze, I can see people buying at $25 and $28, because, hey, who knows?  Maybe this thing roars into the hundreds like GME did, right?

But after it was perfectly clear that RC had bailed out of his position completely, and the squeeze had lost its momentum, and the CEO came out with her ""strategy"" for the future, and the CFO perished under tragic circumstances...What is the catalyst that people are believing will move this thing higher?  Is is just a bunch of bagholders hoping against hope that something will save them?

I'm as much of a ""Give'm Hell!"", regarded ape as the next person.   I'm HODLing X,XXX shares of GameStop because this whole DRS movement still has legs (23% of all outstanding shares direct registered as of the end of July 2022).   I want to see more evil short hedge funds collapse like Melvin Capital.  I consider Kenneth C. Griffin to be the antichrist.   So, I consider myself a tinfoil-hat-wearing, conspiracy-buying, nut-job.  But I just don't understand why people think that BBBY is the way.  I don't get it.   What's left in that stock that will make it rise higher?

I would appreciate any propaganda that anyone would like to share that in any way, shape or form even vaguely resembles due diligence on Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.   Help me understand what I'm missing.

So I've been recently shit on by a bird while standing under a tree, so ima take that as a sign of good luck.

I've got 3 plays , 1 ok play, 1 risky play and 1 cultish play.

Some caution  - join them at your own peral


The ok play, or at least I think it is...

ON  - semi conductor Corp.


Someone posted an awesome DD on this company a month ago here
Company making profits, in good industry and what not

Plays -  Jan 23 - 110 strike


The risky play  - SAVA - cassava sciences 


Bio pharm company trying to produce drug to cure alzeimers 
They are doing a presentation at some conference soon, hopefully they announce something good

They did get hit with allegations of fraudulent scientific data and results or something, but it might of been disproven? Not sure

Anyways plays are 
7 Oct 22, 40 strike
Feb 23, 55 strike

Something weird with this stock, it made a run last week, but for some reason my options wouldn't update in pricing, felt like there was low liquidity or no market maker for this stock , hoping someone could look into that


Lastly I got to include this play - GME

No need to reiterate all the DD, you all know it, if not it's on super S, lots of announcements recently. Can it be considered a cult stock? Sure. But tesla was considered cultish at one point too and see where it is now.

Plays - Feb 23 - 80 strike

At 8:30 AM on 9/8, positive news about the test satellite launch on 9/10 was announced: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ast-spacemobile-announces-bluewalker-3-123100434.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ast-spacemobile-announces-bluewalker-3-123100434.html) .

I believed it would have driven the stock price up. However, some confusing volatility happened right after the news. I sold thinking the stock would have kept sinking. Surprisingly, it started going up in the afternoon and went on the day after.

What do you think caused the delayed positive reaction after the news? Is it usual? Or is it because every stock will go down after I buy and go up after I sell?

    -etc, etc etc,.....


Here's what I've been thinking. This adage was fine and true, before social media. If we are in fact in a true bear market, market crash, and/or recession it would be the first of the social media age. That, in my opinion, changes the game. Main stream media pushes a narrative, social media is a shit storm of all narratives. So, during most down turns, people wouldn't see it coming because all they would have for news/updates is main stream media. Nowadays we have social media where every swinging dick voices their opinion a good portion of which say there's a crash imminent. 

So what I'm saying is, we can no longer rely on what had been true of the past because we are in a new age of social media. Especially since algos tend to only show you what you read most of. Good luck finding an opposing view.

t3_xb4hfe|1662856114|wallstreetbets|Shorting Biopharmaceutical strategy|"Biopharmaceutical Catalyst Options strategy

I saw a YouTube video where a guy shorted a small-cap biopharmaceutical company right before it had its stage 3 trial results released. His basis of reason was that a majority of small-cap pharmaceutical companies have a lot of funding and a lot of potential but usually fall short of creating a drug that is efficacious enough to actually be released in the market. For example, the company he shorted was creating a pill that blocks serotonin receptors to decrease the desire to drink alcohol in heavy drinkers. The trials showed that the pill indeed did decrease the consumption of alcohol but also had a series of hormonal side effects that come with blocking serotonin reception in the brain. So even though the drug worked it was not good enough to be a treatment and the stock plummeted netting him a very hefty profit

He used [https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/](https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/) to identify and obtain DD on pharmaceutical companies with upcoming catalysts.  This website not only provides the date of when the trial results will be released but also the results of previous trials and about everything you need to know about that company. You can use it for free but it will only show you catalysts a few days ahead of time which isn't enough to track companies through their trials and do proper DD. There is a 1-month free subscription but after that, it is 5 dollars a month which is very cheap for such exclusive and powerful information.

The fundamental logic of the strategy is solid. Small cap biopharmaceutical companies do not make it through the FDA dramatically more often than not and stage 3 trial results are usually a letdown. That is our edge. We focus on stage 3 trial results because stage 3 trials appear to be the most important stage in finding out whether or not a drug works and is marketable. We focus on small-cap companies because they usually have a lot more riding on a single drug compared to a large-cap or mid-cap biopharmaceutical company. A large company worth tens of billions usually has multiple drugs being developed at once and more resources which equals a higher chance of success. In the event of a failed drug for a large cap, the overall effect on the company will not be that large, however, in the event of a failed drug in a small cap where it is the only drug or 1 out of 3 drugs being developed, it is a devastating loss. This devastating loss is what causes the large 40%+ downside movements. 

Now that we have established a fundamental concept and edge we have to look at position sizing and risk management to have a profitable strategy. The problem with shorting shares is that we have limited downside potential(100%) and unlimited upside potential. While you might make 50% on 8/10 of the companies you short, you will lose well over 100% on the 2/10. This will not only wipe out your gains but most likely put you in the hole since successful biopharmaceutical companies have been known to exceed 1000% upsides if their drug is approved or effective. The solution to this is options. We can create defined risk put debit spreads. This gives you a defined upside and a defined downside. The risk vs reward ratio can be determined by adjusting how far OTM you buy your spread. If you buy the spread ATM or slightly OTM you will be looking at a 1:1 risk to reward. If you go 20% OTM you'll look at a 1:3 risk to reward. If you go 40% OTM you'll usually see a 6-10:1 risk to reward. This is based on a 7-DTE spread. 

Theoretically, if we purchased 10-15% OTM put debit spreads for a 2:1 risk to reward and 6/10 of our picks did not pass trials we are looking at 800$ of net profit if we bet 100$ each time. 

However, there is a problem because not all small-cap biopharmaceutical companies have options chains. Unfortunately, we can't do anything about this and will have to pass them by unless you are willing to get OTC(over-the-counter) options. I have not messed with OTC options so I cannot comment on them.  The other problem is that the small-caps that do have option chains usually have very low liquidity and very few strikes to choose from. This means that you will usually have to hold your spread till expiration and have the buying power to let them be exercised or the closest to the money spread that you can purchase is too far out of the money to be in accordance with what will give you a reasonably high chance of success. The solution to the latter problem is a ZEBRA or zero extrinsic value back ratio spread. Here is a link to explain it in depth ([https://www.tastytrade.com/concepts-strategies/zebra](https://www.tastytrade.com/concepts-strategies/zebra)). The Zebra allows you to mimic owning 100 shares of stock for approximately 50% of the cost and removes all extrinsic value from the spread. This gives you a built-in stop loss at 50% of what it cost to own 100 shares of the stock and for every 1 dollar the stock goes up you will make 100 dollars. While this spread requires a larger financial commitment it can be done on basically any options chain and you can sell for max profit at any time. You do not have to wait until expiration, unlike a debit spread. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is all I have put together for this strategy so far. I am excited to test it out. I am not experienced or knowledgeable in the biopharmaceutical sector whatsoever so I wanted to share the information I've collected and ask this subreddit if they have any insights they could share with me. Most specifically what catalysts are most important to look at? While stage 3 trials are pivotal I am curious if anyone knows if there was a better catalyst to be against on aside from stage 3.

&amp;#x200B;

Warner Bros Discovery is a media-entertainment giant that has hit rough times lately, debt is concerning and they have not been profitable as of their last earnings report, but the company has some interesting numbers as of lately that could show it being severely undervalued. ( All sources for the information on the DD will be provided at the end of the post).

# Streaming and Box Office

&amp;#x200B;

This year has been great for WBD in this area, movies like The Batman or Elvis have crushed the Box office and have posted great profits for WBD. In the case of Batman the budget was of 200 million and box office 770.8 million and in regards to Elvis budget was 85 million and box office gave 281.4 million. Special mentions to Fantastics beasts budget: 200 million box office: 405.2 million.

In regards with the streaming services of HBO MAX and Discovery+, how will they manage to merge them successfully is still unknown but separately they have posted great numbers, they ended 2021 with 73.8 million users and as of their last earnings call that number has grown to 92.1 million subscribers after adjusting for 10 million AT&amp;T mobility subscribers. This has been shown on their quarter over quarter sales of 220%. This growth is much faster than any of the other companies in the industry (NFLX: 8.60%, DIS: 23.3%, PARA: 18.5%. Source: Finviz).

On the negative side WBD has had to scrap projects that didn't have good outlook like batgirl. This happened because they have to be picky when deciding what should go through because of their debt levels and protect their new DC movies that started successfully with Joker(2019) and The Batman (2022).

# WBD Gaming

&amp;#x200B;

WBD has had a great hit with its latest release Multi-Versus. The game has raked up over 20 million players as of August 22, this can represent a massive cash cow since it is a free to play game which might bring more and more people as it keeps getting popular. This can generate huge gains via merchandise and in game cosmetics.

The gaming division is also scheduled to release Hogwarts legacy on the 10th of February of 2023, this shows a growing outlook and if the games are successful WBD might expand onto the growing market of gaming with some of their most knowledgeable franchises. This division of WBD has overall grown 4% in revenue against the previous quarter with the release of Leg0 Star Wars-Skywalker Saga.

# WBD Networks

&amp;#x200B;

This division for WBD has grown 1% on their last quarter, and advertising revenues 2%. This growth has been explained because of strong sports and audience ratings. This sector is expected to slow growing due to the rise of the internet and unless they manage to get those services in there in some profitable way this sector of WBD might have some trouble, Zaslav seems to have a plan for this according to some interviews .

# Debt

&amp;#x200B;

The largest issue for WBD is their debt, WBD has pushed the lever up to concerning points. Their debt to equity ratio is 1.02, this means that they have more debt than equity which is concerning, specially when going into a macro environment with higher interest rates which means WBD is not going to be able to refinance. The positive side is that when looking at their debt schedule is that their average maturity is 14 years which shows there is time to pay off debt and the interest they have to pay for this debt is mostly under 6% and for their larger bonds is less than 5%.

Zaslav has urged how important it is to reduce their debt levels and they have managed to reduce some of this debt during the latest quarters.

# Ratios and comparison with competitors.

&amp;#x200B;

When comparing with their main competitors WBD seems to be growing faster and their valuation is much more conservative than Disney or Netflix for example. WBD forward p/e is of 11.45 which is a good ratio, their P/B ratio is of 0.58 which means that if you take WBD and sell it by parts you are getting more than what you are getting by market cap. Their P/S ratio is better than any of their competitors with the exception of paramount and in regards of their price/free cashflow WBD\`s is much better than the rest of the giants of the industry. The company that seems to be comparably undervalued by ratios on the sector is Paramount($PARA)

# What are insiders doing?

&amp;#x200B;

Insiders have been consistently buying WBD which may hint at the company being undervalued, they have specially bought after the last dip after their earnings report.

# Conclusion

&amp;#x200B;

If WBD manages to get their debt under control, their streaming servicies continue to grow at the same pace and the WBD gaming section is a success I see this company going long past the target price of 24.74$ per share, specially because the management has added compensation if the stock goes to certain levels in the next few years. I already own WBD and have traded it a lot during the last few months, but at current prices I see it being a really good long term play for the next years

Robinhood is regarded as one of the worst if not the worst retail brokerage firm in terms of order execution speed and quality. But it‚Äôs dopamine consuming confetti and colors have you coming back, so I‚Äôm gonna teach you how a Robinhood order works, from when you swipe to confirm to when your order is filled.

After you swipe, your order is sent to Robinhoods order router, they checks things such as making sure you have enough money, potential dividend risk, potential credit risk, and Rho risk with certain interest rate sensitive derivatives. Then, if everything is good it gets sent out, but how depends on if it‚Äôs a derivative or equity.

Equity/stock.

Equity order execution depends on two different factors. Whether or not the order is a limit or market order, or if the order size is dividable by one standard lot(100shares, i‚Äôll be using the term lot from now on), or if it‚Äôs less than a lot that‚Äôs called a odd lot.

Odd lot orders are routed to a market maker only, this market maker depends on the security, time of day, and the current rate or rebate the MM is paying. Robinhood will always route to the market maker paying the highest rebate, leading to poorer executing quality, as the order will only be filled once the trade will be favorable to the market maker, not once there‚Äôs an auctionable exchange(seller and buyer). In a mixed lot order(ex 145 shares), the odd portion of the order(45s) will be routed in this manner. After hours, these orders are routed to an ATS, that is invisible to the NBBO. It will be filled by market participants on that ATS only.

Moral of the story, do not use Robinhoods ‚Äúinvest in dollars‚Äù feature and if possible avoid trading in odd lots.

If you are trading in lots, and you set a limit order that is not rejected, your order will be sent to GlobalOTC, this is the same ATS that will fill odd lot orders after hours. There is typically OK liquidity here and only slightly worse than trading on exchange. Unlike odd lot orders, orders here are not only fulfilled by market makers, other market participants can add or take liquidity on global OTC.

If you are trading lots after hours, it WILL be routed to an exchange. The current exchange RobinHood markets is partnered with is Archipelago(ARCA). Equity orders will only be routed via Arca, Robinhood will utilize no other exchange, even if there is less liquidity or you have a better chance of being filled on another exchange.

Options -

Trading options is much simpler. A lot in options is usually 10 contracts, and orders less than 10 contracts in size are usually given priority execution. 

In 2020, Robinhood quietly switched in the routable exchange for round and odd lot orders from PHLX to BATS for round lots and GOTC for odd lot.

Market orders for options Will be directly routed to a market maker for execution, The exchange liquidity a market maker puts up is usually depending on the security, But AMEX is popular for Robinhood preferred MMs.

Due to new rules in late 2020 option orders cannot appear off exchange and must appear in the NBBO, so even if your order is routed to GOTC, it will appear as BBO if the offer actually is best. This has led to actually less price improvement, but more transparency.

That‚Äôs all I got, many of the other free brokers operate in a similar way with changes. For example TD Ameritrade will route all lot orders to the exchange with the most volume.

t3_xb12ki|1662846690|wallstreetbets|Buy Puts on NextDecade ($NEXT)|"I will explain why NextDecade is substantially overvalued and why it is one of the most compelling stocks to buy puts. NextDecade‚Äôs market cap of roughly $900M is unjustifiable when considering its relative fundamental value and that the company will not produce any revenue for the next **four years**. Speculation can keep a stock price high for a long time, but eventually and without fail, the genuine, authentic state of a business will reflect on the share price.

Note: Every quote that is used to support my claims in this paper was taken from NextDecade‚Äôs most recent 10-Q filed on August 11, 2022.

NextDecade Corporation is an energy company developing technologies related to the liquefaction and sale of LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) and also the capture and storage of CO2 emissions. The corporation is building a terminal that if successful, will be capable of producing a lower carbon intensive LNG and provide a more sustainable LNG product to customers around the world. The business is essentially attempting to create more reliable and competitively priced energy in the hopes that customers and energy consumers will no longer have to choose between cost-efficiency or being environmentally friendly. The terminal, Rio Grande will lower the capital and operating costs of deploying CCS on industrial facilities.

The essential piece of information that my entire argument revolves around is that the estimated full completion of this terminal is at least four years away. NextDecade‚Äôs entire business is dependent on the completion and execution of this terminal! All future revenues for this business depend on the terminal being built. That is four years of zero revenues, four years of no value being created for the company, and four years of raising capital and public offerings in order to support cash burn:

*‚ÄúThe Terminal will not begin to operate and generate significant cash flows unless and until the Terminal is operational, which is expected to be at least four years away, and the construction of the Terminal will require a significant amount of capital expenditure.‚Äù*

NEXT stock has doubled in the last year on prospects that will not materialize for years to come. To their credit, the company currently holds a strong balance sheet‚Äîthough not high enough to validate its current market cap. The capital deployed so far into developing the terminal gives a net PP&amp;E of $170M. Add in their cash balance of $40M as well as low debt structure, and book value equates to roughly $200M. However, their current cash holdings are not even sufficient for short-term operational success:

*‚ÄúBased on our balance of cash and cash equivalents of $40.5 million at June 30, 2022, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that our consolidated financial statements were issued. We intend to fund the remaining portion of 2022 development activities through the sale of additional equity, equity-based or debt securities in us or in our subsidiaries.‚Äù*

If NextDecade can‚Äôt support itself for one year, how will it stay afloat for four without an ounce of revenue? The answer: debt and dilution. NextDecade can only continue to develop its terminal and other CSS projects through incremental public offerings:

*‚ÄúWe currently expect that the long-term capital requirements for the Terminal and any CCS projects will be financed predominately through project financing and proceeds from future debt, equity-based, and equity offerings by us. Construction of the Terminal and CCS projects would not begin until such financing has been obtained. As a result, our business success will depend, to a significant extent, upon our ability to obtain the funding necessary to construct the Terminal and any CCS projects, to bring them into operation on a commercially viable basis and to finance our staffing, operating and expansion costs during that process.‚Äù*

I am not doubting the success of the terminal and the company‚Äôs other projects. I am conveying that the tradeoff for NextDecade‚Äôs success are two things: diminished stockholder equity due to an over-leveraged balance sheet and drastically higher shares outstanding. The company is well equipped for the inevitability of dilution--while shares outstanding are 126M, authorized shares sit at over 400M! An action that could result in a 50% dilution if just a small fraction of those shares were offered.

NextDecade‚Äôs current market cap of $900M is unreasonable as well when compared to its current financials‚Äî that being a declining book value of $200M, no revenues, and high susceptibility to dilution. Obviously, many companies trade multiples higher than their current fundamental worth, but most of the time it is with the implied notion that they are growing and expanding, and also that value will be created for shareholders in the future. However, in the context of NextDecade, any prospects for success that they may achieve are at least four years away! And that is not only four years away from potential revenues, but likely even longer until genuine profitability is established. Markets can stay irrational for a long time‚Äîbut can speculation and ignorance sustain NextDecade‚Äôs overvaluation for the next four years while its balance sheet decays? I don‚Äôt think so."|0.61|4|0|4
t3_xb042x|1662844130|wallstreetbets|An insight into [SPY] daily high/low patterns|"I came across a table a couple of days ago that looked at SPY daily/high lows and what time they occurred. I didn't really like the fact that the data was sparse, and they did not share how they came about their analyses. This gave me the impetus to try to see if there was a pattern to the madness. This is not an exhaustive analysis, I do not have access to options data which obviously influences things, but the findings are pretty interesting nonetheless.


**Data:** I took 5 and 30-minute ticks for SPY from January 1st, 2019, to market close on September 9th, 2022, and performed the analysis on it. I stuck to binning the data in 30 min intervals as it makes it more palatable and understandable. All the numbers in the tables are percentages of the total number of observed highs or lows. 

#When does SPY hit its daily high for each day, and when does it make its daily low? 

[Table 1 : Daily Low/High on SPY by weekday and 30 min interval.](https://imgur.com/qduICfA) 

**Observations:** Generally, stonks go up. SPY will generally set a daily low for Monday in the first 30 mins and will set a daily high on Friday in the last 30 mins. This also supports the notion that ""buy the morning dip."" Almost all the time in this table, the first 30 mins have the highest chance of setting a low for the day. This also supports the Opening Breakout Range theory for those technical traders. 

#But is there a difference in the pattern if SPY opens higher/lower than the previous day's close? 

To observe this, I broke out the data set into two - one for when SPY opened higher than the previous day and one for when it opened lower than the previous day's close. 

[Table 2: Daily Low/High on SPY by weekday and 30 min interval when SPY opens lowers than previous day close.](https://imgur.com/rTeF8mB) 


**Observations:** What really stands out is if Monday opens lower than Friday's close, it will inevitably set the low of the day in the first 30 mins. BUY THE MF'ING DIP ON MONDAYS.  Generally, buying the dip in the morning session seems to hold on such days. What is really interesting, though, is that if on Thursday we open lower than a Wednesday close, we are usually in for a high of day at the end of the trading session. Moreover, on Friday, the highest chance for setting a high is in the first 30 mins. So what's the narrative? If opening lower on Fridays than Thursday's close, buy puts in the first 30 mins at the pump for some  0dte action.

[Table 3: Daily Low/High on SPY by weekday and 30 min interval when SPY opens higher than the previous day's close.](https://imgur.com/A99vT4j)

**Observations:** If we open higher, generally, the trend is that we set the low in the first 30 mins and then grind up throughout the day to set a high later in the day. This is especially true on fridays when the largest chance of setting a high in the last 30 mins of day.



#So, how does OPEX play out? 

I do not have options data, and since that is fairly important in how SPY moves on opex I cannot give you a narrative on how SPY will move. But I did breakout out all the OPEX days including quarterly expires and they are presented below. 

[Table 4: Daily Low/High on SPY by 30 min interval on OPEX days.](https://imgur.com/iSKSLMo)

**Observations:** SPY will set its high or low in the first 30 or last 30 mins of the day. Thats it. I can't tell you more. haha. 



##Some more general observations and commentary: 

1. The SPY generally snoozes in the afternoon and doesn't like setting a high/low in the afternoon hours. 
2. Stonks go up during the day.
3. Friday last 30 mins is usually power hour, especially on days SPY opened higher than close on Thursday.
4. Monday first 30 mins is best time to buy the dip, especially on days SPY opened lower than close on Friday.
5. Short /ES on Friday if it sets a daily high in last 30 mins.



#EDIT: UPDATES

Some readers across the subs where this has been posted have asked for a few more analyses. 

##Can you break out the pattern based on if the stay started red or green from previous close. 

Below is a series of four tables. They should be considered a 2x2 with Open (red/green) vs Intraday (red/green).

[Table 5: Daily Low/High on SPY by weekday and 30 min interval when SPY opens green and intraday green.](https://imgur.com/D8vIYRC)

[Table 6: Daily Low/High on SPY by weekday and 30 min interval when SPY opens green and intraday red.](https://imgur.com/iRIDNev)

[Table 7: Daily Low/High on SPY by weekday and 30 min interval when SPY opens red and intraday green.](https://imgur.com/6hPhekI)

[Table 8: Daily Low/High on SPY by weekday and 30 min interval when SPY opens red and intraday red.](https://imgur.com/jsyWmLc)

### Observations: 

1. Tuesday drill into close on red days is a thing. It is worse on Thursdays when you start red and stay red.
2. Friday pump on green days into close is also a thing. Look at that. 
3. On intraday green days, you can pretty much expect a power hour.


## Can you see how many green opens and green days we have by weekday? 

[Table 9: Intraday green vs Overnight green by weekday.](https://imgur.com/idPBvIS) 

### Observations: 
Wednesdays have the highest chance of remaining green if we open green. Moreover, thursdays have highest chance of red to green reversal."|0.91|50|0|50

But also there‚Äôs a short squeeze coming because 20% of the float is shorted and under water. 

As you can see majority of the shorts came in around $5.80. Cost to borrow is increasing so they‚Äôll probably start closing soon.

t3_xayp8u|1662840441|wallstreetbets|So why did Apple choose $GSAT to partner with over all the other telecom companies?|"HERE‚ÄôS WHY:

For years, there had been rumors that Globalstar (GSAT) was working with various tech and telecom companies. In 2013, *Amazon reportedly tested a wireless network on a spectrum owned by Globalstar that would have allowed customers to connect directly to the internet.

A finance professor at Tulane University was quoted saying ‚ÄúThis really is the holy grail for Globalstar.‚Äù

Under the agreement, Apple will pay 95% of the costs Globalstar incurs launching new satellites to build out the network. Globalstar said it will raise capital to cover the cost of building and launching the satellites; Goldman Sachs is working with the company to secure financing.

*The most important reason for why Apple chose Globalstar is to stay one step ahead of the competition. The fact that Amazon was so interested in a potential partnership with Globalstar definitely raised the eyebrows of Tim Cook and the crew.

Globalstar is the perfect partner for Apple. CEO David Kagan understands who‚Äôs the big and little brother in this deal. The company isn‚Äôt located in Silicon Valley trying to compete with Apple. They‚Äôre located in Covington, LA."|0.76|27|0|27

# WBD 

&amp;#x200B;

Warner Bros Discovery is a media-entertainment giant that has hit rough times lately, debt is concerning and they have not been profitable as of their last earnings report, but the company has some interesting numbers as of lately that could show it being severely undervalued. ( All sources for the information on the DD will be provided at the end of the post).

# Streaming and Box Office

&amp;#x200B;

This year has been great for WBD in this area, movies like The Batman or Elvis have crushed the Box office and have posted great profits for WBD. In the case of Batman the budget was of 200 million and box office 770.8 million and in regards to Elvis budget was 85 million and box office gave 281.4 million. Special mentions to Fantastics beasts budget: 200 million  box office: 405.2 million.

In regards with the streaming services of HBO MAX and Discovery+, how will they manage to merge them successfully is still unknown but separately they have posted great numbers, they ended 2021 with 73.8 million users and as of their last earnings call that number has grown to 92.1 million subscribers after adjusting for 10 million AT&amp;T  mobility subscribers. This has been shown on their quarter over quarter sales of 220%. This growth is much faster than any of the other companies in the industry (NFLX: 8.60%, DIS: 23.3%, PARA: 18.5%. Source: Finviz).

On the negative side WBD has had to scrap projects that didn't have good outlook like catwoman. This happened because they have to be picky when deciding what should go through because of their debt levels and protect their new DC movies that started successfully with Joker(2019) and The Batman (2022). 

&amp;#x200B;

# WBD Gaming

WBD has had a great hit with its latest release Multi-Versus. The game has raked up over 20 million players as of August 22, this can represent a massive cash cow since it is a free to play game which might bring more and more people as it keeps getting popular. This can generate huge gains via merchandise and in game cosmetics. 

The gaming division is also scheduled to release Hogwarts legacy on the 10th of February of 2023, this shows a growing outlook and if the games are successful WBD might expand onto the growing market of gaming with some of their most knowledgeable franchises. This division of WBD has overall grown 4% in revenue against the previous quarter with the release of Lego Star Wars-Skywalker Saga.

&amp;#x200B;

# WBD Networks 

This division for WBD has grown 1% on their last quarter, and advertising revenues 2%. This growth has been explained because of strong sports and audience ratings. This sector is expected to slow growing due to the rise of the internet and unless they manage to get those services in there in some profitable way this sector of WBD might have some trouble, Zaslav seems to have a plan for this according to some interviews .

&amp;#x200B;

# Debt 

The largest issue for WBD is their debt, WBD has pushed the lever up to concerning points. Their debt to equity ratio is 1.02, this means that they have more debt than equity which is concerning, specially when going into a macro environment with higher interest rates which means WBD is not going to be able to refinance. The positive side is that when looking at their debt schedule is that their average maturity is 14 years which shows there is time to pay off debt and the interest they have to pay for this debt is mostly under 6% and for their larger bonds is less than 5%. 

Zaslav has urged how important it is to reduce their debt levels and they have managed to reduce some of this debt during the latest quarters. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Ratios and comparison with competitors.

When comparing with their main competitors WBD seems to be growing faster and their valuation is much more conservative than Disney or Netflix for example. WBD forward p/e is of 11.45 which is a good ratio, their P/B ratio is of 0.58 which means that if you take WBD and sell it by parts you are getting more than what you are getting by market cap. Their P/S ratio is better than any of their competitors with the exception of paramount and in regards of their price/free cashflow WBD\`s is much better than the rest of the giants of the industry. The company that seems to be comparably undervalued by ratios on the sector is Paramount($PARA)

&amp;#x200B;

# What are insiders doing?

Insiders have been consistently buying WBD which may hint at the company being undervalued, they have specially bought after the last dip after their earnings report.

# Conclusion

If WBD manages to get their debt under control, their streaming servicies continue to grow at the same pace and the WBD gaming section is a success I see this company going long past the target price of 24.74$ per share, specially because the management has added compensation if the stock goes to certain levels in the next few years. I already own WBD  and have traded it a lot during the last few months, but at current prices I see it being a really good long term play for the next years

* **Link to ARK's reasoning &amp; model on why ARK can be $605 by 2026**:  [ARK‚Äôs Expected Value For Roku in 2026: $605 Per Share (ark-invest.com)](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/ark-roku-model-2026/) 
* **Today's share price**: $72
* **My price target by 2026 after reviewing ARK's model and updating assumptions**: $238

&amp;#x200B;

**My high-level assumptions by 2026 to get to $238:**

* **ROKU Active Accounts:** 85m
* **ROKU Revenue**: $6,100m
* **ROKU Gross Margin**: 52%
* **ROKU EBITDA margin**: 26%
* **ROKU EV/EBITDA Multiple**: 20x

&amp;#x200B;

**How I get to 85m Active Accounts for ROKU:**

* **Current situation**: ROKU started the year with **60.1m** active accounts. They would need to add **25m** accounts or **5m** accounts/year to reach my forecast
* **Global Population**: 8,280m
   * assumes a simple 5-year CAGR of **1%** from 2015 to 2020 projected out until 2026
* **Global Households**: 1,690m
   * Pew Research suggests that the average person lives in a household of **4.9** members (*8,280/4.9*)
* **Global Households with Broadband**: 1,566m
   * About **80%** of global households have broadband and I assume it will go up to **93%** by 2026 (*1,690m x 93%*)
* **Global Households with Connected TV**: 1,096m
   * About **57%** of global households have broadband and I assume it will go up to **70%** by 2026 (*1,096m x 70%*)
* **ROKU's Market Share of Global Households with Connected TV**: 8%
   * I assume ROKU's market share stays the same as today as they make progress with their international expansion efforts offset by competitors catching up with ROKU. 
   * **85m** ROKU accounts = **1,096m x 8%**
   * ARK assumed that ROKU could increase their market share to **13%**. That would yield **143** active accounts and a **$434** share price by 2026.

&amp;#x200B;

**How I get to $6,100m revenue for ROKU:**

* **Current situation**: ROKU makes **\~$46/account**
* I used the same modeling framework as ARK looking closer at how many hours per a day the accounts identified above would watch streaming, ad minutes per hour, video impressions per hour, ROKU's advertisement inventory share, video ad sell-through rate, and CPM
*  Those inputs assumed that ROKU would make **$72/account.** 
* Right now, **50%** of U.S. TV time is spent on streaming by consumers. But, only **22%** of TV ad budgets are spent on streaming by marketers. 
   * There's a big gap that will need to be closed over time if advertisers want to follow where customers are today.
* As a simple sanity check, ROKU would be making **$105** \[(*50% / 20%) x $46*) if streaming TV time and streaming TV budgets were at parity. 
   * My $72/account assumption is well below that so I like to assume my assumption is very conservative

&amp;#x200B;

**How I get to 52% gross margin for ROKU:**

* **Current situation**: ROKU's gross margin is **52%**. 
   * That includes **64%** gross margins on it's Platform business, which is **83%** of revenue
   * That includes **-11%** gross margins on it's Player business, which is **17%** of revenue
* I assume gross margins will stay the same for ROKU because I expect the Platform business to grow faster and account for **96%** of revenue. There will be a gross margin benefit from that.
* But, I expect Platform gross margins to decrease to **53.5%** since more of their Platform revenue will be based on a higher mix of video advertising.

&amp;#x200B;

**How I get to EBITDA margins &amp; multiples:**

* I just stayed with the same assumptions as ARK and the margin &amp; multiple makes sense since ROKU will be a more mature &amp; scaled company by then.
* In 2021, ROKU had an EBITDA margin of **16.8%** so a **26%** margin by 2026 looks reasonable since they won't need to spend as much once they're scaled.
* Also when ROKU is at scale, they won't be growing as much and will be valued more on EBITDA as opposed to revenue. A 20x multiple is conservative based on today's market conditions and what other scaled tech companies can fetch. 
* If market conditions improve, that multiple could go up to **25x** and increase the valuation to **$289/share**"|0.66|9|0|9

The banana barons aren't getting pampered as much, and the banana merchant doesn't get to see as many bananas (he does this because he loves looking at bananas, smelling them, etc even if they're not his)

So the banana barons and the banana merchants come up with a plan. They agree from now on, 1 banana = 2 bananas 

This sucks for the banana consumers, but it benefits the banana merchants. As a market taker now you have to pay 2 bananas for every 1 banana you need, but as a market maker with connections to the monkeys that own the banana trees, you can get 2 bananas from the central bank for every 1 banana you collect in payment.

Suddenly the banana consumers don't feel so safe about their savings, the banana merchants get to touch a million bananas a day, and the banana barons are getting pampered again."|0.31|0|0|0

And since this somehow became a thing in the comments of my last post - yeah, that's not a straight screenshot of any of my brokerage accounts, I put the images from Schwab, Fidelity, and ETrade together into one picture on MS Paint because I've got no interest in sharing my full accounts or account numbers with the internet.

The first crop scout reports on the US harvest are out and they're brutal. USDA revises their yield numbers next week. India, in addition to banning wheat exports has now added duties on rice exports. The current market bull run is on low volume and looks like it might be a fib retracement - hopefully it is, but it might run more before it comes back down. My account has been kept barely afloat by very short term calls on SPY and TQQQ that I've been running as hedges. Doesn't make up for the losses, but has allowed me to start to average down on my longer dated positions."|0.8|39|0|39

I respect ur conviction as I too share such a conviction. I shall share with you all a glimmer of hope. 

Thursday when Powell spoke, the market manipulators decided to finally release the estimate of the august CPI after withholding the estimates for so long which led to the market recovering and pumping from Powell‚Äôs impact. This was planned to create a squeeze which as we have seen has killed many of our üåàbrethren. I strongly believe next week we will witness a rug-pull. 

I‚Äôm gonna keep this short since I‚Äôm too lazy to attach images and explain them. But I went on the charts and tried to estimate by staring and using volume distribution to guesstimate the average cost of crude for July 22 vs July 21 and august 22 vs august 21. The results are wonderful bear bias and are as follows:

Average crude oil price 

July 22- $97
July 21 - $73

Aug 22 - $90
Aug 21 - $67

yoy % change/increase
July = 32% 
August = 34%

So I‚Äôm terms of oil price changes from 2022 and 2021 between august and July they are about the same. Meaning if oil was the sole component of CPI we would have 8.4-8.6 and not the estimated 8.1

Even if other shit dropped in price I HIGHLY doubt it will result in a .4% drop YoY. I believe this drop in oil prices is due to some macro seasonal effect cuz in 2021 oil also dropped those months. N=4 aka unreliable but good enough for conformers bias. Isn‚Äôt that what ur here for? So off that the september CPI should come in hot dung October (based off oil prices). Some say car prices this n that dropping but haven‚Äôt they already been dropping?

Imo the only reason we saw the drop from 9‚Äôs is because we had oil prices drop July and august which compared to a year priory the oil prices were rising/flat hence a smaller % change but in august 2021 oil prices were dropping so the current oil price decline shouldn‚Äôt be as impactful as a .4% decline to CPI. 

Tdlr: if we assume oil to be the only contributor of CPI then we should get a hot/flat CPI at about 8.4-8.6 which would cause a dump as it will be well above the fake estimate of 8.1 which was used to pump the market. 

Note: core CPI did not drop last month as it is not directly impacted by oil indicating that inflation did not peak last month (correction added as an edit ‚Äî‚Äî core peaked in May) 
Edit 2: core estimate remains at 6.1 compared to last month which was also 6.1 (came in at 5.9 which is same as month before) so at least big money doesn‚Äôt think we‚Äôre ready to turn down further on core despite it being lower than estimates last month. Make of this info what u want but it builds some foundation for the thought which is that core can come in higher indicating inflation did not peak yet


Edit 3: July 2021 CPI was 5.4 and august 2021 was 5.3 meaning the reference point for this august is 0.1 higher meaning assuming everything stayed the same between the two months then we‚Äôd have 8.6% YoY. If everything changed equally in terms of relevance between 2021 and 2022 just like oil priced then the CPI will come at 8.6/8.7%

Edit 4: also looking at he overall 2021 CPI data the cpi dropped sharply in July and august then spiked in September aka these are deflationary months for whatever reason. Maybe spending is slowing idk if it‚Äôs seasonal I‚Äôm too lazy to pick up and check past 10 years but one this is for sure. 1. We have a lower reference point 2. We have similar price changes to July meaning inflation will not be that much lower if even lower compared to last year.

Also obv I lack lots of data and these are all rough estimates. 

Every time now that I posted a bearish DD the market recovered and pumped like crazy and I was always wrong so u can inverse me based off my track record or pray that I am correct this time if ur a üåàüêª. I‚Äôve also been right in the past with forecasts but the market reacted opposite of what I anticipated so I‚Äôm really good at being wrong even when I‚Äôm right. I‚Äôm not guru, this is not financial advice, I‚Äôm on the last of my savings here, I am also jobless.


Edit 5: I think if he‚Äôs invoking volker we‚Äôre likley to see more than 1bps or more soon. CPI is YOY so rn we‚Äôre hiking rates and running QT so deflating aka if relative to 2021 the 2022 average CPI is 10% cuz prices rose 10% then if prices rise 2% in 2023 it‚Äôll seem like inflation has been defeated but reality is we‚Äôre actually 12% from 2021 before hyperinflation started. And in 2021 inflation was running abt 5-7% hence real inflation even with the bullshit formula would be around 15% compared to pre pandemic. Inflation much like stocks compounds. Right now with high numbers he had the ability to throw blame on the numbers and hike crazy. Once next year starts he won‚Äôt have such liberty. Inflation won‚Äôt go down until rates are higher than CPI so we‚Äôd need like 10%  rate at minimum and asap as Powell said himself before the consumer starts pricing it in to everyday life cuz that‚Äôs how the inflation spiral happens. He‚Äôs more than likley to wait post election to drop the big bomb of a hike.

Stop looking out in the world for your Dad and thinking you are dependent on some guy like Elon, Jpowel, Trump, Cohen...  Someone to save you from yourself and save humanity.  These people are not demigods or anything other than dudes who go home, take a handful of anti depression pills, get drunk and call ex girlfriends, yell at their wives and go to bed. They are normal as fuck and yes they are rich but they are simply lucky humans - right place right time and some talent- and mostly white.

That's the second part - why does this sub just worship old white American men who are fucking crooks?  Operah Winfrey is a billionaire - Kanye West is a Billionaire,  the world's 4th or 5th richest guy is Mexican, and hell, I'd even take a Putin worship tour on this sub rather than 1 more stupid meme of a washed out Elon musk or holder meme. 

 Back to point #1 - if you want a Dad, look to the person next to you, who has survived far longer doing better than you - you dumb fuck, look at them, and turn down your pride and get out your pencil.  It might be your neighbor, the woman working at Target, some uncle or aunt, your mother, a distant cousin you maybe had some jealousy of...  See thru all that and find a real mentor, a real friend a real parent - or someone you can actually reach out and learn from.

These carpet baggers are fun I guess and give community to this sub.  But I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I lost money on many little BS adventures out here since COVID - coins, Options trading on meme stonks, numerous pump and dumps on this sub.

I've never lost my shirt - I literally make all my WSB as money I do not intend to have - but over time it's not funny when you ARE the joke.  These people we may joke are ""dad"" - it's actually fucking sad and I blame myself.

But that doesn't mean we can't realize that getting nickeled and dimed and scammed - eventually the pot runs dry and patience runs thin with these crooks. 

Steal a thousand dollars from 1 person, expect a $1k ass whooping.  Steal $1k from 25,000,000 people - expect your life to not turn out as you planned.

So these guys are not your dad any more than Ophra Winfrey is your mom.  Fuck Elon and the only thing he is Papa of is his 20 fucking kids that he should spend time being a parent to.  Fucking clown."|0.38|0|0|0

Lets take a look at a few things before we get into the charts and the technical. 

If you follow me you know that I came into this week bearish and I was positioned with some 390p 14dte puts expecting a touch of 370-380. Now the question is why was a bearish? 

Well going into this week we had the attempted breakout at 430 that led to a massive sell off that led to 3 red weeks with us finally turning in a green week on SPY this week. On a technical standpoint puts made sense and calls would have been against the trend‚Ä¶ in addition we had the CPI looming. Going into this week and going into Thursday we had no forecast and we had no consensus on CPI. With literally every single fed member, JPOW himself and heck even Biden saying ‚Äúinflation has not peaked‚Äù with the massive sell off, the suspiciously long time we went with no CPI forecast/ consensus one would assume it was because they were going to predict inflation &gt;8.5% (higher then previous). However, Thursday the forecast came in at 8.1% and today the consensus also came in at 8.1%. 

Now that we have seen CPI come in bullish, markets have accepted the fact that we most likely will be seeing a 75bps hike no matter what CPI is and markets clearly rallying despite everything JPOW re-iterated Thursday morning‚Ä¶ and now looking at the technical with a massive V bottom rally off 390 (after consolidation) and a break through of the 405.2 level‚Ä¶ its pretty hard to not be bullish going into next week.

After 405.2 broke intraday today and we held it I took a loss on my then 12dte puts I have no reason to expect a reason for us to go down. Now the only reason I remotely could expect any sort of bigger sell off to break 405.2 next week would be IF CPI comes in dogwater like 9%. If CPI comes in at 8.5% or below markets are about to shrek back to 430 if not higher. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4kv3ovp6xwm91.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d3847b0ea297345adb8599983c311c6080d9f1b

Looking at SPY daily you can see we have a very sharp and distinct V bottom using September 1st and September 7th to start the V. We have now held that support for 3 days in a row. I spoke on the fact that in the last 16 days there had only been two times that SPY had back to back green days well this is the first time since the peak at 430 that spy has put in back to back to back green days. This in my opinion is the change of tide. The bear sentiment has left the market. 

We broke through that blue resistance line. This is the line using August 16th and August 26th tops. Breaking this line is saying the bear movement is over and we should be looking for the next bull run. In addition, a close back over that level resistance of 405.2 is extremely bullish especially after a failure to continue lower after breaking 390. While we could see a return back to 390 (but unlikely in current bullish sentiment and news cycle) a closure over 405.2 should lead markets to push back for a 417.3 level test. 

Bulls managed to close this daily candle completely over the daily 8ema. Until that daily 8eam is broken we should be bullish. 

Now today did leave a \~$2 gap on the daily chart that COULD be filled before we push higher. I do forsee a scenario Monday where we back fill that gap and see a little weakness going into CPI. Actually a red day Monday would give way for four green days in a row after CPI comes in positive. 

Key supports- 405.2 (level support) -&gt; 402.7 -&gt; 401.8 (V bottom recovery support) -&gt; 400.4 (gap fill at 400.86) -&gt; 397.8 

Key resistance- 409.6 -&gt; 412 -&gt; 415.3 -&gt; 417.4 (level resistance) 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at SPY weekly we are have broken out of that downward channel on the weekly too. Now the one interesting thing is that SPY weekly did break through the blue June/ July recovery support line (futures and Apple also did), however, despite that being a bearish signal we rallied off of that level. 

I called it out earlier in the week but we are seeing a double bottom like formation at 392.2 also on the weekly and closed higher then last weeks candle which should signal upside. With a weekly close back over the daily 8ema and 100ema as long as spy holds the daily and weekly 8emas we should be bullish. 

Key support- 390.3

Key resistance- 412.5 -&gt; 426.1

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/amrjf5x7xwm91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa7527fb19b7fbfd22fc44dc2de49d0b11408349

Futures has a similar V shaped recovery also, however, it did not break through its bear run blue resistance line as that was at 4105. While futures did close back over the daily 8ema it did fail to close over the 100ema. 

Key support- 4060 (v bottom support) -&gt; 4025 -&gt; 4008 -&gt; 3980

Key resistance- 4092 (blue resistance) -&gt; 4128 -&gt; 4148 -&gt; 4200

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/31lra5i8xwm91.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52f32bfa150d8713c893f39713f5cb61fc376bab

Futures weekly did break through that blue support line as I mentioned in SPY, but with this new bounce we will make the new support recovery line. We saw the weekly also break the black bear channel too along with closing back over the 8ema and 100ema. With a level close over 4025 we will next look for 4160 and 4280.

Key support- 4025 -&gt; 3900 (blue bull support)

Key resistance- 4160 -&gt; 4280

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/40erpo09xwm91.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11cf85d6f6dab4325067dce3bb701ce7283e5aa5

I had mentioned that pretty much all week and even some of last week that Apple was looking extremely weak compared to SPY. We did not see that v bottom recovery that futures and SPY were showing form until today. With two intraweek closed below the daily 200ema that would appear to be very bearish, however, we actually saw Apple put in quite a bit of strength today. 

Apple failed to close over its daily 8ema but we can look for that to take place next week along with pushing for that blue bear resistance from this sell off. 

Key support- 156.7 (v bottom support) -&gt; 155.5 (200ema) -&gt; 154.4

Key resistance- 158 -&gt; 160.3

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f35jp1j9xwm91.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1e2b74f697ccb2e88564a611cebe0a1b248160d

Now Apples weekly is where things get a little peculiar when you factor in Apples daily and SPY/ the general market and sentiment shift. 

The apple chart is still holding within the downward channel from the August 15th and August 22nd weekly tops. But unless Apple opens under 156.7 and holds there the remained of the week Monday will most likely open over that level. However, we are seeing a gravestone doji weekly candle closed (the opposite of what we saw the week of August 15th) and this should signal a push green next week. 

Key support- 154.7 (blue bull support) -&gt; 154 -&gt; 150.3

Key resistance- 156.7 (bear resistance) -&gt; 161.1 -&gt; 163.5

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s4maeh3axwm91.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8f35581154b61494d684630ebd463a800c0d84e

As I mentioned on Thursday the VIX had broken the recovery support line and has closed its 3rd consecutive candle below 25.5 With this failure to breakout to 30 and looming bullish (aka lessened fear) of CPI and FOMC coming up we should expect to see the VIX retest the 18s and 19s soon. 

Where am I at now? 

Overall going into next week I suspect Monday to be a red day or at a minimum a consolidation day with most like a 0.5 +/- finish. While the markets do expect CPI to be bullish I would be hesitant for the markets to close a 4th green day in a row and then have that proceeded by a good CPI and see 5 green days in a row. Crazier things have happened but after 3 pretty big green days (when you think about the last month of sell off) it would not be surprising to see small decline on Monday. A retest of 405.2 and possibly even a gap fill back to 400 could be in play. 

From there I do expect now that the forecast and consensus along with the Cleveland Fed CPI all coming in below previous CPI of 8.5% that we will get a ‚Äúgood‚Äù CPI reading (good as in reading less than previous CPI of 8.5%). I believe this will start a rally into FOMC (the next Wednesday the 21st). From there markets will get their expected 75bps hike (remember markets don‚Äôt like the unexpected so even if bearish‚Ä¶ if its known they handle it well) and from there we see a rally through end of September into October which takes us into the next earning season. 

To be honest with CPI expected (and again assuming its good) coming down, the expected 75bps hike and really no new bearish catalysts to be had (unless someone can tell me something im missing here‚Ä¶) once CPI drops on Tuesday‚Ä¶ there will be really little reason to not be playing calls into middle of October when we see the next earnings start. These earnings could be the only thing in my opinion that would take the market down but even there I don‚Äôt expect any more massive sell offs unless a new catalyst happens. 

My plan-

Overnight calls (small position) 3-5 strikes OTM (going to do some research this weekend on what will be the best play) Monday night into Tuesday morning (for the CPI good reading play). 

I will let Tuesday of CPI shake itself out‚Ä¶ there is a chance core CPI could come in high and we could see a sell off on that but would be unlikely as long as the actual CPI is decreasing (below 8.5%).

From there either Tuesday night (risk on) or Wednesday night (more conservative) I would consider opening some 30-45dte calls on SPY (and possibly Apple). 

If you are aggressive you could open calls on Monday and let those ride also. However, you risk here being wrong about CPI and having CPI cause a major break down. 

Note- I will have my FOMC post up next weekend with a trade analysis and trade plan

10% challenge-

Overall this was a GREAT week for me‚Ä¶ honestly one of the better weeks I have had in a very long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wvghhzyaxwm91.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be119a69e9517edf2668a9b6618d339f8284e9f7

So what did I change this week? I spoke on this a little in my last weeks TA but I went from about $1500-$2000/ entry down to about $700-$1000/ entry. I also over the last few weeks have found myself hesitating on entries. Essentially I would be watching my indicators and see the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù setup forming and I would see what would be a great entry forming, however, I would say well don‚Äôt be early‚Ä¶. Be patient‚Ä¶ and what I would end up doing is waiting for extra extra confirmation that the trend move I saw was actually happening. This would net me a great entry but I found I was missing such a large % gains because of this. Moves that shoulda easily been resulting in 15-25% gains were being capped at 3-5% gains because by time I was ready to enter the premiums had already priced the move in and the acceleration of the move was already done. This also resulted in many times that if I didn‚Äôt immediately enter I would end up red. 

With a little big more aggressiveness‚Ä¶ really pro-activeness on entries and recognizing its okay to be wrong as long as I keep a stop loss in place (definitely stuck to my -20% stop loss all week without waver) then I found myself with a much higher win rate and a much higher pay out on the wins I did bring in. This week was a really good mental week for me (and financial week). I look forward to carrying this success and strength into the rest of the month and year. 

Another thing I recognized this week and was able to adapt to was the trend. While I was holding 14dte puts most of the week I did not find myself staying biased the last 3 days. I was able to play the intraday trend while having an overall bearish trend in mind. 

The one thing I could have done differently this week when I look at my 14dte puts I opened after 390 broke and after we closed below 390 was to wait for extra confirmation. I could have waited one more day (which would have definitely resulted in not entering the same puts) and saw that we closed back over 390. A little bit of patience here could have resulted in not even opening that position and that also could have allowed me to more clearly see the support that and strength that 390 was putting in. I did begin middle of the week to recognized the consolidation that was taking place between 401.4 and 390, however, I would have liked to recognize that earlier. The one thing I will say though is that when Apple is known and has been historically driving the markets‚Ä¶ when apple is continuing to push lower and look heavily bearish despite SPYs movements, its not that out of line to expect SPY to catch up to Apples momentum. However, we saw this week that the general market (non-tech) was driving this rally. 

If you look at my intraday log I did open some 30dte calls on SPY and Apple near EOD today but I did decide to close them before EOD. I was going to be pro-active and let these run after the great CPI forecast and everything but I decided that with 3 green days in a row we should expect a consolidation day and possibly even a bigger red day to fill that gap before CPI starts a potential bull run. After being too aggressive with the put swings im okay with being conservative here‚Ä¶ and if I am correct waiting 2 more days to enter calls is not going to make a big difference. The magnitude of this next potential ‚Äúbear market rally‚Äù could take us up near 440-450s by middle to end of October‚Ä¶

(Proceed with caution, I am a poor smooth brain positions at bottom)

So first the short term: Zumiez ($ZUMZ)

Fear of a recession doesn‚Äôt cast a good outlook on any mall company, especially overpriced shoes and skateboards, and my local Zumiez has increased prices by relatively 40% by what my smooth brain can tell since I bought Christmas presents last year.

They have lost 45% of their value since the year‚Äôs beginning missing the last two quarterly estimates and this last Thursday missed by a HUGE amount going from 38.2M net income last quarter to a shit -397k. Earnings went from a prediction of $3.44 per share to around $1.55 a share.

Which brings me to my play: On Thursday the stock crashed about 14% on the news and since rebounded to higher than it was before earnings Thursday?! My brain is telling me with an ape like certainly it will drop at least $4.5 so at $27 that $25 put exp either 16 Sep or 21 Oct looking especially juicy!

(Positions: TRYING to buy 3 puts $25 exp 16 Sep, 1 put $22.5 exp 21 Oct, and 1 call $30 exp 16 Sep in case it somehow rockets)

So to my less hair brained long play:
Veon Ltd ($VEON)

This is an international cell phone provider network, 11th largest in the world, that also provides internet, sells transmission equipment, and does IP address hosting.

When the invasion started, as a company with over 1/3rd of their revenue from Russia, their stock tanked on fears of sanctions. The company itself was not banned from trading as their headquarters is in Amsterdam however. Still they remain down HEAVILY, why?

I believe it is due to the Russian ruble still not being accepted again by Western markets meaning 1/3rd of their net income is currently in a useless currency as well as they have been trending down over the last two years missing earnings and accumulating a large portion of debt trying to expand into new markets. BUT this will end soon and here is why:

1. A massive amount of their debt ($900B RUB) was transferred from their HQ to their Russian branch allowing them to pay off their debts with the otherwise useless rubles.

2. They have sold off their towers in all markets where they were losing revenue to other companies (Georgia &amp; Italy) increasing liquidity.

3. All their current markets are up in net income in their own local currencies (by an average of about 11%), the war currently makes the transfer of some of these currencies to USD currently show as an earnings loss.

4. They bought out Djezzy, a small satellite network, and invested heavily into Dajstyr, an extremely popular e-commerce platform in Pakistan for future sales partnerships and more of a monopoly in their area.

Which brings me to my play: Buy stocks, will at least return to pre-war levels ($1.4ish about triple the current price) being more profitable now than before the war. And in my smooth opinion it will go even higher once the ruble is accepted again internationally with the changes they have made to about $2

$COST is due to report earnings on Sept 23 with a 4.2% move priced in. Here's my bull thesis;

August sales, 2021 vs 2022 +15.3%  
July sales, 2021 vs 2022 +10.8%  
June sales, 2021 vs 2022 +20.4%

Unlike most retailers, Costco makes the majority of it's money from memberships, not from sales. Notwithstanding, the fact that sales have continued to climb is a good indicator that new member sales, and member retention remains strong. If you've been inside a Costco lately, you know that they are as packed as ever if not more and the shelves are fully stocked indicating they have their supply chain under control due to their low SKU count compared with hurting retailers.  


In the past decade, Costco has issued a special dividend 4 times, the last being in 2020 which makes them due to issue another soon.  


Their last membership price increase was in June of 2017, which makes them overdue. Given that many members use the more expensive executive membership, and get more than enough cash back to cover the cost, they should have ample pricing power to increase without risk of significant cancellations.

Costco's last stock split was in January of 2000, 2 for 1, which makes them due for a split.

Costco typically beats estimates, and doesn't usually move that much making options comparably cheap with IV currently 34 for 9/23. if they announce any one of those catalysts above, an IV beating spike is a reasonable expectation. If they announce more than one or all 3 it may re-test $600.

Some of you are up a good chunk of change since I posted last week. I just want to reiterate for the newer people that is is not a squeeze play, this is not a get rich quick thing, this is not dependent on WSB. I am holding this for 10-15 years.

RISK: At this moment, this is a high risk binary play. This company will either go bankrupt or it wont. I am going to show you 6 years of DD showing why it will not go bankrupt.

**The Problem: Amyris has been lighting cash on fire for 10 years transitioning from biofuels to its lab-to-market vertically integrated precision fermentation platform. Look at this graph (10 years).**

https://preview.redd.it/8eg9fl1p8wm91.jpg?width=577&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30363fea0100b14f6f47078617984ca26d18a8e6

&amp;#x200B;

Even when we zoom in (below 1 yr) we see that the market absolutely loved the reveal of its ""Lab-to-Market"" platform but still is pricing it for bankruptcy because of the low cash on hand combined with cash burn.

https://preview.redd.it/fjnnsg8q8wm91.jpg?width=3319&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61c0951d7593d19495bc249db0234ebbc2ba6f1e

**Why Bankruptcy is off the table:** Since 2016 Amyris has been working on its vertically integrated lab-to-market platform and started pushing out brands based on molecules that it has scaled up. I'm sure either you, your wife, or her boyfriend may have heard of these brands.

https://preview.redd.it/rudk09wq8wm91.jpg?width=1336&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=505c684bbd1d674a8c3a66e7cc825edd99995da8

All of these brands are based off of molecules developed from Amyris' lab to market platform. Squalane, Hemi-Squalane, CBG, RebM, Ectoine, Bio Silica, derivatives of Farnesene etc. By the end of the year, Amyris will be the FIRST company to scale up 20 molecules - more than all of its competitors combined.

Every molecule developed by Amyris is more sustainable than other methods. See RebM example below.

https://preview.redd.it/p2nb8gqr8wm91.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e19c007ab1794478726f05c665390a09fbc4118

&amp;#x200B;

The psychos over at the Amyris subreddit have realized that order numbers are sequential, so since 2017 we have been buying from all of Amyris' brands at the beginning and ending of each month to come up with Direct to Consumer Numbers.

[credit: Green\_and\_green](https://preview.redd.it/ql5pjk2s8wm91.jpg?width=2131&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc4ad63eb73336f8751e3c37530e68e27df87db2)

Amyris has been targeting beauty and cosmetics because this sector can have really fast market acceptance. Because of the ""Lipstick effect"", these brands will also do well during recessions. Not all brands will be a success, but that's ok!

&amp;#x200B;

Amyris also has names like John Doerr backing it, I'm pretty sure the guy behind Amazon and Google isnt going to let his synbio stock die off.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Now... none of this means that Amyris is safe. But it does mean there is an opportunity at hand. Here are the two events that we will be watching for.**

**1) What will Amyris' price be if it proves that it wont go bankrupt?**

**2) What will Amyris' price be if it proves that it is the first viable synbio company after (1)?**

**I don't know the answers to these questions... but I'm pretty sure its more than $3.70**

I think this is the last cup of tea before the 10 year tendie train takes off. There is also a big gap that can be filled.

**TL;DR -** I am betting Amyris is going to be the first viable precision fermentation company capable of targeting an endless TAM of molecules - creating them biosynthetically.

We have been on a bull run for the past 10 years, and the labor markets have been very soft. Businesses were able to operate very optimal and lean because there was a macro environment that provided such stability. The Labor Participation vs Average Wages were trending inline with each over for years, Fed Rate was promoting basically free money borrowing, and CPI and PCE were predictable and stable. That all changed with COVID and as the macro economic model was thrown out the window as we  detached from fundamentals. I believe this has and will continue to effect the macro economics as we may be shifting from an environment of aggregate supply into one of aggregate demand and distribution.

# Lets look at some macro economic trends 

[10 year, 5 year, 1 year and 6 mo TTM's, vs St Dev for those time frames.](https://preview.redd.it/d5ssk4uwkvm91.png?width=902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d62da716210dad27266653fc40ee6adfe0908540)

Let's look at the facts:

1. Core PCE is currently *way* above the average, for the last 6 months, averaging 4.84% which is over 2x the 10 year average bench mark. PCE measures the change in goods and services consumed households. It's much more sensitive to change in spending, however it's flaw is that it won't account for the change in behavior, only tracking change in TTM. So even if consumers switch to cheaper alternatives, it may not necessarily be impactful if overall CPI remains high. You can say we are trending down, but again this number does not account for shift in behavior in spending (aka cheaper alternatives).
2. CPI is obviously up, everybody knows it. Currently we are seeing it averaging about 2x the 5 and 10 year benchmarks. With PCE elevated, businesses have been pricing this in for over 6 months now. Gotta put the genie back in the bottle.
3. Now lets look at workers. Labor participation is steady ***but*** are wages highly elevated. This means that there is sticky labor wages from inflation getting priced into the labor market. This is a problem, as reflected in PCE and CPI.

**In brief, inflation appears to be sticky.**

# Now let's examine the chart below from 2019 - Current.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0ftslzvmjvm91.png?width=4304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57f71de17ca61903203959a70c18c3024c44ae91

Follow Labor Participation, this represents TTM Change %. Compare it to Unemployment (TTM Change %). This represents how strong the job market is. Compare the Labor Participation to the Average Wages now, and compare it to CPI data. This represents how much more people are making in this market, and how much it is in return sticking to core pricing in the economy. 

We can now compare this information to see how the FED  uses it's lever of interest rates and how this in turn has an impact on the greater economy. There is generally a lagging effect for rate prices to hit the market, as represented in 2006, FED raises to 5% in 7/1/2006. Unemployment did not peak until late 11/1/2006, 4 months later.

If we extrapolate this out, we most certainly have all the necessary elements for more movement to the downside. CPI is appearing to stick to Core PCE, which is currently about 1.75x over it's normal range. Wages to participating labor are diverging still. In other words, the economy needs to contract to shake off these inflated prices. Job market needs to get softer, wages need to drop so core PCE and CPI will deflate.

# Thesis:

Core PCE must return to normal ranges, currently Wages and PCE are extremely elevated, meaning the high inflation CPI is effecting and sticking to prices and spending over the long term.

In order to cage inflation, FED is going to raise it's rates aggressively to slow down economic growth. Shiller PE shows economy is already in a downturn, which has shown in the past to be a good indicator of an oncoming recession or economic shrinkage.

**Let's review how the TTM change in Shiller PE**

https://preview.redd.it/0sfpvbaenvm91.png?width=4604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01a9d9d9b31538730e3c83f06a780773ea22ba52

All the necessary elements and political headwinds point to a shift dynamics, I believe the FED will push us to a recession to cage inflation before it sticks to core pricing and most importantly wages. I also believe if we are to go into a recession, it will not be brief.

# ELI5: This is not a bullish environment, trade selectively and hedge your bets. Expect more downside. Good luck everybody, and have fun at the casino.

 Annaly Capital Management, Inc. Announces 3rd Quarter 2022 Common Stock Dividend and Reverse Stock Split

BY Business Wire

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Annaly Capital Management, Inc. ([NLY](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Feresearch.fidelity.com%2Feresearch%2Fgoto%2Fevaluate%2Fsnapshot.jhtml%3Fsymbols%3DNLY&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7C91e52145539946c46b2708da92799a10%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637983348226295779%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=n5J4Ovxh9x7rskP84zvQc8sxlSboZoXM5sCrGjaWHL0%3D&amp;reserved=0)) (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚ÄúAnnaly‚Äù) announced today that its Board of Directors declared the third quarter common stock dividend and has unanimously approved a reverse stock split of the Company‚Äôs common stock at a ratio of 1-for-4.

**3rd Quarter Common Stock Dividend**

The Board of Directors of the Company declared the third quarter 2022 common stock cash dividend of $0.88 per share of the Company‚Äôs common stock (maintaining the Company‚Äôs dividend of $0.22 per share before the reverse stock split, adjusted for the 1-for-4 reverse stock split). This dividend is payable October 31, 2022, to common stockholders of record on September 30, 2022 (based on the number of shares of common stock held by each stockholder on such date after giving effect to the reverse stock split). The ex-dividend date is September 29, 2022.

**1-for-4 Reverse Stock Split**

The reverse stock split is expected to take effect following the close of business on September 23, 2022 (the ‚ÄúEffective Time‚Äù). Accordingly, at the Effective Time, every four issued and outstanding shares of the Company‚Äôs common stock will be converted into one share of the Company‚Äôs common stock. The Company‚Äôs common stock is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on a post-reverse stock split basis beginning on September 26, 2022, under a new CUSIP number: 035710839.

The Company is implementing the reverse stock split with the objective of reducing Annaly‚Äôs number of shares of common stock outstanding to more closely align with the number of common shares outstanding for companies of a similar market capitalization. As a result of the reverse stock split, the number of outstanding shares of Annaly‚Äôs common stock will be reduced from approximately 1.8 billion to approximately 445 million. 

Furthermore, the Company believes the reverse stock split will make the common stock more attractive to a broader range of investors, which has the potential to reduce share price volatility over time.

No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Instead, each stockholder that would hold fractional shares as a result of the reverse stock split will be entitled to receive, in lieu of such fractional shares, cash in an amount based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on September 23, 2022. 

The reverse stock split will apply to all of the Company‚Äôs outstanding shares of common stock and therefore will not affect any stockholder‚Äôs ownership percentage of shares of the Company‚Äôs common stock, except for de minimis changes resulting from the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares. Stockholders of record will be receiving information from Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the Company‚Äôs transfer agent (‚ÄúComputershare‚Äù), regarding their stock ownership following the reverse stock split and, if applicable, payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares.

Stockholders with certificated shares of common stock will receive a letter of transmittal from Computershare with instructions on how to surrender certificates representing pre-reverse stock split shares, which will become book-entry shares post-reverse stock split. Stockholders should not send in their pre-reverse stock split certificates until they receive a letter of transmittal (which will also include a lost securities affidavit with respect to any certificate that cannot be located) from Computershare. In order to receive new shares of the Company‚Äôs common stock, cash payments in lieu of fractional shares, and any future dividends or distributions the Company may declare with a record date after the Effective Time of the reverse stock split, stockholders must return these certificated shares of common stock or a lost securities affidavit. Stockholders with book-entry shares or who hold their shares through a bank, broker, or other nominee will not need to take any action.

t3_x9z1re|1662738799|wallstreetbets|Beware low-volume rallies. The final fib.|"TLDR; The Nasdaq is currently rallying with an abnormally low volume of daily trading over the past few days (\~400,000,000 to \~600,000,000) with respect to the 3mo average (\~1,100,000,000). This comes off of a local bounce from a significant Fibonacci level, but will not sustain.

The market is currently experiencing another significant ""rally"". This is, however, in the absence of any circumstance that would merit such a sharp rise in equities. Volume is significantly suppressed (as indicated in the picture below), making small volume block trades much more impactful for moving the market. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8lpn2j2mrum91.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e71c9d8898df88526b57dacbe0e6c084c32aeb1

The most logical reason for the rally in the absence of logic is a simple fib retracement. Fib retracements are extremely common, but this one is a little different. It's the last fib that guards equities against a free-fall event. I've posted this below.

&amp;#x200B;

[NASDAQ Fibonacci retracement off bottom fib](https://preview.redd.it/r5zxabt5sum91.jpg?width=1519&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=389ae4ed151ef94341f9f81e3ab6cd43a588f646)

If this model holds true, the algos or firms trading these fib sequences will send us back to \~12,150. Once we hit this point, one of two things will occur.

1.) We will hold around 12,150 for a short time as the markets decide to accept or reject to the downside. 

2.) 12,150 will be immediately rejected slightly lower \~12,130 as the true sentiment of the market makes itself known and larger firms take advantage of the exit liquidity.

I believe that scenario #2 is the most likely scenario. Valuations, given current macroeconomic trends, cannot be justified at these levels and are unsustainable. I would also expect the put/call ratios to be much more dramatic towards the upside if the market truly believed in its own solvency, but as you can see [here](https://ycharts.com/indicators/cboe_equity_put_call_ratio), that simply isn't the case.

Everyone talks about short interests like its the only two word in their vocabulary but its time for me to teach you a new word.

**GAMMA SQUEEZE.**

B-b-b what does that mean? Like the hulk? Sort of.

When dealers sell you stocks or options they have to hedge against you. When they sell calls, they buy stock. When they sell puts, you guessed it they **sell stocks.**

**But** what happens when they sell too many puts at a cheap price? What happens if a bunch of fucking retards underpriced? Suddenly their puts are ITM and now they have to sell, its like **GME IN REVERSE.**

Based on this chart we can see that September is mostly bullish for the rest of the month. But...you see that in October? What is that?

That's right! Somebody sold too many puts, you don't have to be a genius to see that October is expected to be a bloodbath. With the VIX at lows, this means premium on **puts** **are** **CHEAP AS FUCK.**

So what does this mean? It means that puts are cheap as fuck, but more importantly so is the vix, the following chart shows that the VIX is in contango coming into a massively bearish winter.

Do you think the market could fall that far?|"High-profile investor Scott Minerd said Thursday that he expects stocks to fall another 20% by mid-October, citing a historical connection between price-to-earnings ratios for stocks and inflation.

""Since 1960, P/Es have trended lower when #inflation is higher. With YoY core PCE now at 4.6% and S&amp;P500 trading at \~19x, we should see stocks fall another 20% by mid-October ... if historical seasonals mean anything,"" the chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners tweeted.

Expanding on his position in a subsequent interview with CNBC, Minerd said it was ""stark to see the price-to-earnings ratio where it is"" during what has historically been the ""worst time of the year"" for the markets, during September and October.

""Given the recent strength over the last few days, it just appears that people are ignoring the macro backdrop, the monetary policy backdrop, which basically indicates the bear market is intact,"" he argued.

Minerd noted that his historical comparison looked at trailing P/E, meaning that the condition could be even worse if earnings figures start to come down, which he thinks is possible given that ""we may very well already be in a recession.""

""I don't see earnings picking up dramatically. And actually, I see some downward pressure on earnings coming out of energy and other sectors where we've had price declines,"" he said.

Minerd is far from the only high-profile money manager to predict a sharp pullback in stock prices. Michael Burry recently reiterated his opinion that the equity market has yet to hit a bottom.

That said, some investors remain bullish on a longer timeline. See why Dynamic Funds' Noah Blackstein believes that now is the time investors can ""make your money ... for the next five years."""|0.63|8|0|8

Electric car giant Tesla is evaluating the feasibility of a lithium hydroxide refining facility on the gulf coast of Texas.

Tesla said the plant would be focused on the development of ‚Äúbattery-grade lithium hydroxide‚Äù and be ‚Äúthe first of its kind in North America,‚Äù according to a newly released letter to the Texas Comptroller‚Äôs Office.

The company would process ‚Äúraw ore material into a usable state for battery production‚Äù then ship the lithium hydroxide to various Tesla battery manufacturing factories, the application said.

In April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company may need to get into lithium refining because the cost of the metal had ‚Äúgone to insane levels.‚Äù

The price of lithium is up 120% this year, according to an tracking index from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Respected Traders and Investors,**

Why so serious. ? Sit tight and let's calmly assess the situation from never seen before perspective. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[EurUsd vs SPX](https://preview.redd.it/5x9hzkiqdtm91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba1c949f959e366df08637f16401a4f681c34cd7)

&amp;#x200B;

**Theory :**

Eurusd down -&gt; Dxy up = Due to mirror chart hypothesis considering Dxy is a basket of forex currencies.

&amp;#x200B;

Hence Dxy up = Stock market down

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***Candle sticks :***

So this is a EurUsd chart which just keep going down and down and down. The only way for it to go up is Ecb hikes rates aggressive than Fed but its a double edge sword. You will be hiking rates in a recession and cause depression considering Ecb had negative rates.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason :

\- Inflation is out of control. ( Over 8% )

\- $1.5T in debt which can be margin called. ( Just keep distributing money )

\- Oil and Energy shock. ( Due to their reliance on Russia )

\- Winter is coming. ( Northern Hemisphere. XD )

&amp;#x200B;

Result  : Europoors according to Wall Street bets.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***Moving averages :***

White descending moving average = 50 dMA

Green descending moving average = 144 dEMA

&amp;#x200B;

Observation : 

\- Not once have we crossed 50dMA since January mini rally.

&amp;#x200B;

 Result : Currently we are trying to break 50dMA. But i don't think we will break it. The situation is similar to drop after post march Fomc rally.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Arrows :**

If Bear market ( ) {

&amp;#x200B;

maximum To 50 dMA 

\- White arrows + White arrows : Mini bear market rally

\- Blue arrows + A ---&gt; B wave    :  Big bear market rally

&amp;#x200B;

minimum To 144 dEMA 

\- Blue arrows + A ---&gt; B wave     :  Big bear market rally

\- Green arrows + Green arrows :  Big bear market rally 

}

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Fib retracement :**

\- Never have we crossed 61.8% fib levels since january 61.8% retracement rally.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**SPX chart : ( Orange line )**

&amp;#x200B;

\- Notice the alternation between arrows ( white/green ) and A ---&gt; B wave 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Look for this pattern :

&amp;#x200B;

Last blue arrow : Gave July post Fomc big bear market 2.0 rally. ( Above 15% )

Last white arrow : Gave post June 15 mini bear market rally.

&amp;#x200B;

Last to last blue arrow : Gave May  post Fomc big bear market rally. 

Last to last white arrow : Gave April mini bear market rally.

&amp;#x200B;

Last to last to last blue arrow : Gave March post Fomc big bear market 1.0 rally. ( Above 15% )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Result : White arrow more likely than green arrow.**

\-10% is all i ask from $4000-$4100 to $3600 i.e. to my favorite 200wMA. ( If we reject 50dMA)

&amp;#x200B;

**Invalidation :** No invalidation. If this white arrow cross past from 50dMA to 100dEMA making it green arrow we will still be in a bear market. The only difference will be SPX will be moving to levels  $4200 - $4300

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

With lots of love

Thank you

- C. Energy crisis, rising inflation and higher interest rates hit the weaker countries in the EU. Banks of certain countries (i.e. Italy, Spain) need to be bailed out.
- D. Other: please explain.

Edit: I'll add a few more options that seem plausible:

- E. After years of financing stock buybacks with tons of cheap debt, tighter economic conditions and higher interest rates force companies to sell a lot of their stock back, causing a crash.
- F. China invades Taiwan. The microchip shortage gets a lot worse and supply chains coming to/from China get disrupted.
- G. Russia weakens Europe by cutting their gas supply and then invades the Baltics. Possibly while scenario F. plays out simultaneously.
- H. Deflation. Inflation was just due to a temporary ""revenge buying"" behavior from consumers coming out of the pandemic. The FED raises rates, supply chains improve, consumers run out of their discretionary budgets and start spending less because everything is so expensive. We enter into a deflationary spiral. Debt gets harder to pay, and asset prices go down because... why would anyone buy an anything now if it will get cheaper next year? Dollar goes up, stocks go down."|0.73|52|0|52

Interest rate markets have almost fully priced-in another 75bps rate hike for this month‚Äôs FOMC.

The S&amp;P500‚Äôs rejection from resistance around 4300 seems to have found some support near 3900 this week. This constant back-and-forth of the Fed insisting on their priority being to curb inflation, and market expectations for the tightening cycle to ease, could cause $SPX to oscillate between these two key levels until the outlook becomes less murky.

There's always a reason to go short but the vast majority of time it doesn't pay. ""QE is the main cause we went up so much so this time is different""

Now compare the current ""QE bull run"" to the rise from 1985 to 2000. I think we have to go a tiny bit more to even come close to the dot com bubble.

We also see that frequency of longer downturns decreased and recovery time got shortened by a lot. This is mainly caused by technology advancements and market improvements. Here's also a hundred reasons why we should be at zero but we aren't.

In the past 193 years, US equities have suffered an annual loss greater than 20% just 9 times. You have to understand what severity of economic suffering must happen for those horror scenarios. A fast crash is caused by panic and doesn't last as long. There must be massive pain for a downturn to last. We're talking about world wars and famines. So don't forget when a bear talks about a 50% crash with a lost decade they basically say it will be world war levels of suffering.

t3_x9jfrn|1662691008|wallstreetbets|"PSA: ""Short volume"""|"Short volume doesn't mean what the vast majority of the regards here think it means.

They correlate it directly with short interest.

FINRA has a report, that comes out daily... this report is designed to be consolidated with the exchange data.  It is off-exchange transaction data.  This is where ""short volume"" comes from.

If you look at this data, you'll find that for most equities, the short volume is between 30 and 70 percent, on any given day.

That *does not in any way mean that that percentage of the volume that day were actually new short positions*.

There's a reason for this.  Because of the way brokers handle transactions, it is *exceedingly common* for them to take your order, blindly, and execute it from their internal pool of equities.  That is entirely for execution reasons.  So, if you sell, say 1000 shares of X at the bid, they sell 1000 shares of X at the bid from their pool (even if they don't have any).  Because of FINRA rules, this is reported as a ""short sale"".  They then journal your 1000 shares to themselves.  You have made a constructive sale of your *long position* to someone else, and the transaction is reported to FINRA as ""short volume"".  The reason that this journaling of your shares to your broker is invisible is because *that* is not a reportable transaction to FINRA.

If there were truly 50% of all volume in any given equity initiating a new short position, the market would have insanely high short *interest* at all times.  And it does not.

The vast majority of transactions corresponding to volume are actually market participants buying and selling long positions.

For the love of all that is holy, please stop misinterpreting ""short volume"".

:::::::::::EDIT::::::::::::::To all you naysayers.... People who think GME is Dead... I have to explain something.

And this is above and beyond everything I write down there .... I want to be very clear about this.GME fluctuates (on average) 14% in ONE DAY, at least once a week (over the last year).  Every week, on average, there's a day where it moves 14 fucking percent or more!Over the last year, it has moved 8% in ONE day HALF the time.   When you wake up on ANY given trading day, there's a 94% chance GME will move at least 3%, a 50% chance it will move at least 8%, and a 36% chance it will move 10% or more.  And that's just your average run of the mill day.  Then there's days like what I'm talking about is likely to happen.  The three best days of the last year, GME moved 64%, 58% and 40%. Days like that happen every 4 months on average.  Do you understand how much money you can make when the stock jumps 50% in one day? Approximately 25 TIMES your investment (if you bet on options).  $300 is all of a sudden worth $7500.  $1000 is all of a sudden worth $25,000.

I can only give you facts.  But any one who says this stock is dead?  You're out of your mind.  


  
EDIT 2::::::  
I'm fucking banned for 5 days for missing my NVDA prediction.  So I'll see you guys next week.

**INVESTMENT THESIS**

**NOTHING is ""priced-in"" at the moment** (very favorable asymmetric risk-to-reward set-up). Any positive news and these cannabis stocks will go +100% off the bottom easily.

Stock Tickers

**$CGC $TLRY $CRON (Only Canadian Companies with Exposure to USA &amp; Europe)**

**$CGC Canopy Growth** has exposure to the USA as they have right to buy Multi-State Operator Acreage Holdings (New Jersey/New York Licenses) + Wana Brands (#1 Cannabis Edibles in North America) + Jetty's in California for extracts. They also bought  BioSteel Sports Nutrition (energy/health drink) which is actually doing very well in North America. Finally, Constellation Brands $STZ invested $4 Billion in 2018 and can provide a distribution network all thought-out the USA. If **SAFE Banking Bill** gets passed this year or lame duck session, Canopy Growth will be able to close on those USA M&amp;A acquisitions based on ""Federal Permissibility"" (no need for full Federal Legalization as per their legal team).

**$TLRY Tilray** has exposure to USA beer investments which they can turn into THC down the road, MedMen debt deal and exposure to Germany when Europe goes legal.

**$CRON Cronos** has a $2 Billion investment from Altria $MO the tobacco company. They lost on e-cigarettes (JUUL), so Cannabis is their play.

**$MSOS (USA Multi-State Operators)**

OTC names like Curaleaf, Green Thumbs Inudstry, Truleive ect can't be bought on platforms like Robinhood due to schedule 1 drug, but **$MSOS** the USA cannabis ETF is on the NYSE.

Luminar is a global automotive technology company ushering in a new era of vehicle safety and autonomy. For the past decade, Luminar has built an advanced hardware and software platform to enable its more than 50 industry partners, including the majority of global automotive OEMs. From Volvo Cars and Mercedes-Benz for consumer vehicles and Daimler Trucks for commercial trucks, to tech partners NVIDIA and Intel‚Äôs Mobileye, Luminar is poised to be the first automotive technology company to enable next-generation safety and autonomous capabilities for production vehicles. 

**Take**

Still to early to announce ANY winners in the LiDAR sector. But, I like Luminars prospects. I would further suggest that it is only a matter of time before Tesla admits that LiDAR is a crucial component of ADAS, autonomous self d**ri****ving.** 

**Overview of Partnerships/Competitive Landscape**

Some deals I know of--OEMS only (no robotaxi/shuttle/software, etc, deals included):

Volvo-Luminar

Nissan-Luminar

Mercedes-Luminar

SAIC (Shanghai Auto)-Luminar

Polestar-Luminar

Daimler Trucks-Luminar

3 more wins to be revealed in 2022--Luminar

BMW-Innoviz (but very delayed and troubled)

VW-Innoviz

Stellantis-Valeo

Hyundai-Valeo (defunct)

Mercedes-Valeo ( current, but replaced in next generation by Luminar)

Audi-Valeo (defunct, replaced by Innoviz in VW deal)

Cepton-GM

Lucid-Robosense according to Lucid SEC filing

Lotus-Robosense and Hesai both claim deals

Human Horizons (Chinese)-Hesai

LI Auto (Chinese)- Hesai

Nio (Chinese)-Innovusion

Great Wall Motor (Chinese)--Ibeo

Toyota--Denso (defunct?)

Xpeng (Chinese)-Livox

Some of these deals are in fairly trivial quantities. The Nissan-Luminar deal, by itself, is bigger than the rest of the list combined, by a wide margin. Some deals are known to be placeholders, and in other cases (GM, BMW) the OEM is said to be dissatisfied with the performance of their current provider.

FWIW, prominent lidar companies with no OEM deals include: Aeye, Aeva, Microvision, Baraja, Opsys, Mercedes, Quanergy

In this post I will explain why TCRT is a substantially overvalued company. Optimistic speculation has caused the stock‚Äôs valuation to rise significantly past rationality which is why I expect a decline of over 50% in share price in the coming months. 

Alaunos Therapeutics is a clinical-stage cell therapy company that is focused on developing T-cell receptor therapies that target tumor specific mutations within genes. These therapies are aimed at aiding clinical patients diagnosed with cancer. Speaking frankly, I have very little understanding of what this company is doing nor do I think that I could fully grasp the science behind the business even if I tried. What‚Äôs important is that I have a precise understanding of the core fundamentals behind Alaunos Therapeutics and can clearly recognize and articulate its unmistakable overvaluation. 

Starting with it‚Äôs balance sheet, TCRT‚Äôs cash balance of $60M is the majority of all it‚Äôs assets. The company holds around $30M of long-term debt making stockholder equity as of it‚Äôs last 10-Q approximately $40M. It‚Äôs important to note that Alaunos Therapeutics generates zero revenues and has not generated any revenue for years. To the best of my knowledge TCRT has managed to stay afloat through both debt and public offerings since the company does not create any value. 

This quote from their last 10-Q reaffirms this: 

‚ÄúThe Company has operated at a loss since its inception in 2003 and has no recurring revenue from operations. The Company anticipates that losses will continue for the foreseeable future.‚Äù 

The underlying notion I want to emphasize is that TCRT‚Äôs valuation of $700M is nowhere near justified when realizing that they not only have a p/b of over 17, but revenue is nonexistent. Alaunos Therapeutics, in essence, is a cash burning business spent on R&amp;D that can only stay alive through continuous shareholder dilution. 

Since June 2021 and beyond, shareholder equity has steadily declined due to incremental capital deployment on R&amp;D and G&amp;A. 

On June 30, 2021, equity was $88M On Sep 30, 2021, equity was $68M On Dec 31, 2021, equity was $58M On March 31, 2022, equity was $49M On Jun 30, 2022, equity was $40M 

   

Book value has declined over 50% in the past year due to the high cash burn. To further exhibit my claims, this is a quote from Alaunos Therapeutics last 10-Q: 

‚ÄúBased on the current cash forecast, management has determined that the Company's present capital resources will not be sufficient to fund its planned operations for at least one year from the issuance date of the financial statements, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.‚Äù 

However, on the off chance that these high multiples were standard in the industry, I compared Alaunos Therapeutics to other competitors in order to determine whether TCRT was really an outlier or not. Autolos Therapeutics, Adaptimunne Therapeutics, and MaxCyte are all clinical-stage companies developing cell-based therapies aimed at aiding cancer patients. Like TCRT, all companies are cash-burning businesses, spending aggregate amounts on R&amp;D quarterly, all the while maintaining zero if not minuscule revenues over a prolonged period of time. Though these companies are all similar in nature, the only discrepancy in value lies among Alaunos Therapeutics. After a brief examination of each 10-Q, it became clear that TCRT was an outlier. Autolos Therapeutics for example holds cash reserves of $200M that equates to its book value yet has a market valuation of an astonishingly low $280M resulting in a p/b of 1.3. MaxCyte and Adaptimunne follow nearly identical stories with a p/b of 2.4 and 2.3. Again, for reference, TCRT has a p/b of over 17. Alaunos Therapeutics has the lowest cash reserves and stockholder equity yet has a higher valuation than all three companies! Factoring in TCRT‚Äôs supposed future prospects and offering a generous p/b of 5, a $350M valuation would be justified at best giving a share price of around $1.60. 

It‚Äôs also important to note that despite overvaluation, I believe that Alaunos Therapeutics will continue as a going concern for the time being, but at the shareholder's expense. On September 7th, Alaunos released a prospectus outlining plans for a public offering that will increase shares outstanding from 217M to 233M granting the company up to $50M. Unless Alaunos achieves any real clinical success, dilution will be their only method of financing, something that they have done for years, and also because they have no other way besides debt to raise sufficient capital to continue operations. Their most recent offering diluted TCRT's share price by 15% but does not include dilution caused by offerings in years prior."|0.66|6|0|6

**The Uranium Stock play is both a Day, Swing, and long term play.**

**Why Uranium:**

First off Uranium stocks are leveraged plays on the price of Uranium and can be extremely volatile both ways up and down but I would expect most here are use to that, If Uranium price runs from $39lb to $50lb =29% gain.If it cost $38 to produce 1lb Uranium  ""Profit Margin""went from $1lb to $11/lb = 1,100%  Increase.

Currently Uranium is around $52 in the spot market and needs to be a lot higher for companies to get into production to meet the coming record uranium demand.

In the past some Uranium stocks have ran up 5,000 % to even 100,000% in a few years time. The latter Not typical but this shows how volatile these are.This happens when a Uranium stock grows  from a tiny explorer into a big producer. Example in 2003 Paladin energy a Australian Uranium stock ran up 104,000% in four years.

There was an investor named Robert Healy a construction worker in 2003 that invested around $300k in Paladin and in those four years he was worth $417 Million dollars with leverage to that $120 million dollar gain in Paladin. This is just showing what previous unicorn Uranium stock plays have done, this is not typical.

In the last 2 years The largest Uranium Stocks are up as high as 389% to 2000% even with the overall market pullback. Uranium stocks combined around 65 or so are smaller than your average NASDAQ stock.

Usually Uranium prices have a big bull market run every decade or so with a boom bust cyclical cycle ending the run when overproduction starts but that is not happening as there is a nuclear energy renaissance going on.

The world has not seen this many nuclear reactors built or restarted  since the 1970s when Uranium prices ran 700% to all time highs of $218 dollars adjusted for Inflation.

**During the 1970s** Uranium run,the U.S. had

* \-Stagflation
* \-Energy crisis
* \-Market crash
* \-Record inflation
* \-A recession
* \-Record rate hikes
* \-U.S. Nuclear Energy Renaissance - 55 New Reactors-

**Today** is a mirror of that but there are

* 300+ Reactors possibly coming up.
* 150 Reactors from China
* 32 reactor Restarts from France
* 17 Reactor Restarts from Japan
* Diablo Canyon in California
* Palisades- USA

&amp;#x200B;

Uranium takes multiple years to make Nuclear fuel and it is a hard process so there is less competent competition and this makes Utilities contract years in advance for the fuel to hedge against a supply disruption like we are seeing now.  Soon 700 Million lbs of Uranium long term contracting is coming back into the market. **OPPORTUNITY.**

https://preview.redd.it/9umjwyedipm91.jpg?width=1373&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddab60f1865b31b22f1ba6e9c2482299c5f51c27

**Uranium Trade:**

Now Uranium trades in two markets not available to most investors unless you have tens of millions of dollars to trade. So this is why there are Uranium stocks.

1.primarily in Long term contracting market with major Utilities.

2.Spot market which could be buying and selling from

* Traders
* producers
* processors
* Big fund Investors
* utilities
* U.S. DOE Government soon.

These markets are opaque as most long term contacting data is not public, the spot market for uranium trades a min of 100,000 lbs ,this is physical Uranium where the buyers name is put onto a barrel and stored at a facility like Converdyn. That being said there is no fiat Uranium so it is not like other commodities at all.

The nuclear fuel cycle from rocks in the ground to fuel in a reactor is very long, fragile and a big catalyst currently as there have been kinks in the cycle .

**Why Uranium stocks could see massive gains soon, Many Catalysts in the works.**

* Uranium added to the U.S. critical minerals list
* Approved U.S. russian uranium enrichment ban
* Uranium Enrichment ban from russia
* U.S. Gov DOE buying Billions of dollars in Uranium they requested.
* U.S. 4.3 billion dollars request from the executive branch for U.S. Uranium Enrichment approved.
* Risk of supply disruptions, Russia and its allies are the biggest producers of Uranium.

As you can see there is a nuclear energy renaissance in the World but the U.S. has the most reactors, 92 and they are the ones that could see the biggest market share upside with Uranium production.

Utilities are coming up on their long term contracting needs and they need to be replaced.

[Long term Contracts running out and need to be replaced.](https://preview.redd.it/kjirnq7oqpm91.jpg?width=3380&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fe87b843892d6773fe054543fcff99d5e2003fa)

&amp;#x200B;

The total future Market Share for Long term contracting uranium in the world is 700 Million lbs , this is not even accounting for future reactor builds over 300 planned, or the 100s of Small modular reactor demand. This comes at a time where Utilities need more Uranium as their  long term contracts are running out.

[700 Million lbs of contracting is coming back. See 2005 for the spot volume\/Contracting lbs of 250 million what it did to the price of Uranium and gave the big run back then. ](https://preview.redd.it/ux7ot42hupm91.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c95710195fe57c5fbd7987e55b6b612f32a2d52)

The U.S. production for Uranium was pretty much 0 lbs. produced last year!

Back in 1980 it was 43 million lbs a year produced. See chart BELOW.

[Soon the U.S. will get back into 1970 style Uranium production. Opportunity.](https://preview.redd.it/ewb24091spm91.jpg?width=870&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53a3adfcbd6d30313426adc5e35a7c7900dc9be4)

Remember  the U.S. has not really been a big player in Uranium production since the 1970s into 1980s.

They produced some in the previous Uranium bull market but the recent 10+ year Uranium bear market ,low Uranium prices stopped any real production and growth.

That all changed with the recent  major news and government support.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Play I think has big upside.**

UEC which is a uranium producer in the U.S. Currently $4.37 around $1.4 Billion dollar Market cap.

UEC has

* 307 Million lbs Of uranium
* 5 Million lbs physical at $38 so ifUranium hits $200 its worth $1 Billion and they can use this to contract with U.S. Utilities.
* They have 0 Debt
* $180 Million in cash &amp; Liquid assets
* 2nd most liquid uranium equity so it see's a lot of day/Swing traders trade it.
* Largest Diversified Portfolio in U.S with the Highest grade uranium with their recent JVand takeover of UEX corp and their asset in the Athabasca Basin In Canada as well as their Joint ventures are with a couple of the largest Uranium companies in the world.
* 172 funds invested in it and growing.
* The CEO is also a great Uranium CEO that puts in the media work.
* They have former DOE Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham on their board.
* UEC also just got the Uranium One assets the ones everyone was talking about with Russia and Hilary Clinton. National Heroes ;P

UEC also has access to these many U.S. uranium assets that have sat since the 1980s that will be very valuable in a high priced Uranium environment.

&amp;#x200B;

These Texas Uranium deposits are commonly associated with oil &amp; gas.

Amir the CEO of UEC believes that Big  oil could get back into uranium again like the 1970s as a hedge. In the 1970's Big oil companies Mined Uranium especially in Texas and New Mexico.

Because many countries and states are banning gas could we see Big oil hedge with Uranium?

I believe it's probable.

The writing on the wall could be the recent big news of Saudi Arabia plans for a 10 nuclear reactor deal with south Korea by 2030!

https://preview.redd.it/vio4nsthspm91.png?width=887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae4ae25460b83e9b05fa599ba3aa88823a92b9af

I have been covering Uranium for the last few years and bought originally back in march 2020 at the lows you see in the green chart at the top.\\

I have also day/Swing traded them with the major volatility.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe their is upside in the short and long term here.

It's probable UEC could fill a lot of the market share in the future for Uranium contracts from U.S. Utilities that want more domestic secure supply of Uranium and possibly supply the government which is back in the market.

The Uranium bull market is just getting started and it is likely we are in this media attention ""MANIA PHASE."" After all you did just read this entire Uranium thread ;)

Something to look at here on the 15min intraday chart is that for the last 6 days (and really 7) we have been trading within the same range of 401.4 and 389.5. The bulls cant quite seem to break us out over 401.4 and the bears cant quite break us under 389.5. We really are seeing a consolidation zone before we see the next leg up or the next leg down.

However, we do not have a consensus yet. As you can see from the last CPI consensus and forecast can be different. But they usually are pretty spot on with eachother. It will be interesting to see where consensus comes in at and when they finally release it. 

I think it was pretty tacticful that they released the forecast of CPI today before the talk for JPOW when markets obviously were not having a negative reaction and sell off today. The best assumption for the bullish push today does come from markets positively viewing CPI forecast.

The red bear channel that started with the August 16th top has officially been broken on SPY and Futures. Using the support line from that channel and the support from the last two days of recovery we actually are forming a pretty impressive V bottom recovery. 

There is a chance we could be forming a new intra-trend purple bear channel though when you look at the last 8 days of trading. 

Key support- 397.9 (black recovery V support) -&gt; 393.2 -&gt; 390.4 -&gt; 388.5 

Key resistance- 400.4 (purple bear resistance) -&gt; 401.4 (15min intraday resistance) -&gt; 402.2 -&gt; 405.2

If we were to see a bigger green day tomorrow 1.2%+ we would actually break through the 405.2 resistance line and a closure above that line with the ‚Äúanticipated‚Äù beat on CPI could actually lead to a bigger move back to test 420 resistance. However, if today was just a small rally within the bear leg and we close under 395 and preferably back under 390 (-2.6%) that could be the signal of a sell off to come. 

Something to keep in mind for SPY‚Ä¶ of the last 16 trading days there has only been 6 total green closes and today/ yesterday make only the 2nd back to back green days in 16 days of trading. Each green day (besides the back to back green) were proceeded by atleast a 1% drop and the back to back day was proceeded by a -3.38% day. If we are to see a third green close tomorrow I would anticipate that as a change of tide and be bullish.

That EOD small rally actually gave futures the room it needs to potentially be holding and selling the black v bottom support tomorrow. 

Key support- 4000 (black support v bottom) -&gt; 3957 -&gt; 3907 

Key resistance- 4010 (purple intra-trend bear resistance) -&gt; 4025 -&gt; 4060

Apple is actually quite peculiar. You can see that the chart does not mirror SPY/ Futures anymore. SPY and Futures both see a nice V bottom forming. However, when you look at Apple today actually marked the fourth day of making a lower low and the 8 lower low of the last 9 trading days. 

Of the last 15 trading days Apple has only closed 4 of them green. The other interesting anomaly is that Apple closed almost -1% today and SPY managed to close +0.65%. We are seeing TECH (well at least Apple) being bled out while the rest of the market rotates and holds SPY up. Its actually quite intriguing to watch. 

Apple was able to close back below its 200ema on the daily today also which is bearish for Apple. While I prefer SPY this might be a time where we see Apple as the better trade. You can also see that Apple is no where near breaking its red bear channel down either. 

Key support- 154.4 -&gt; 153 -&gt; 152.2 (black support of intra-trend bear)

Key resistance- 156 -&gt; 156.7 -&gt; 157.2 (red bear resistance)

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that should have anyone in longer term puts slightly worried is the VIX (this includes me). I am seeing the VIX broke through its bull support line and now is actually in a descent down. IT also closed its 2nd day in a row below 25.5. 

Overall when we had broken 390 and closed below 390 I was bearish and felt that it was the right move entering longer DTE puts. My current 13dte 390P are not doing so hot ( I did not average them down today). There is a real possibility that I chose the wrong side and that what we are seeing is truly a bigger 390 V bottom move back to the top. 

If tomorrow closes back over 405.2 I will be closing my puts, however, if we close under 405.2 and especially if we close closer to 390 I would still feel solid in my trade.

While the forecast for CPI is bullish (CPI lower then previous) the consensus is not out yet and the thing I cant get past is that EVERY fed member including JPOW today has said ‚Äúinflation has not peaked and we are not going to stop hikes.‚Äù So to me a 2nd lower inflation reading seems a big outta play for me. 

We will see what tomorrow brings and I will evaluate EOD what I plan to do. Historically CPI (2 days before) bring a massive sell off of about 2% and the week prior to FOMC brings about a 3-5% sell off so there is a reason to continue to hold my puts. I will evaluate EOD tomorrow and go from there. 

10% challenge-

I recognized pretty early today that I was not going to want to trade today (we started with a major bull trend) which I of course bought before the drop‚Ä¶ lol but over all when SPY is volatile and so wishy washy like this its better left untouched. I did, however, notice some really great setups on Apple today and was able to capitalize on that. I will look at more Apple plays as long as SPY is disconnected from Apples trend and Apple is in a trendy playable mood.

## The problem: 41% of humanity is offline

Over a decade ago, internet access got established as a fundamental human right. However, 3.2 billion people remain offline. \[[1](https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280222-The-Mobile-Economy-2022.pdf),[2](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-digital-divide-internet-data-broadband-mobbile/)\] Cellular dead zones plague the world, and 6% of global population doesn't even have cellular coverage.

Imagine how your life would be different without internet: no email, no Google, no YouTube, no Wikipedia, no social media, no chat apps. That's the reality for billions. And 6% of people \[[1](https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280222-The-Mobile-Economy-2022.pdf)\] have it even worse - not just no internet access, but also no cellular coverage. Even calls with family or to emergency services can't be taken for granted by everyone, or everywhere.

Based on the current rate of the internet coverage expansion projected by the United Nations, the goal of getting 90% of the world‚Äôs population online won‚Äôt be achieved before 2050. \[[16](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/10/universal-internet-access-unlikely-until-2050-experts-say-lack-skills-investment-slow-growth)\]

Without aggressive innovation, meeting this target will take even longer. High initial costs of cell towers dramatically slow down connectivity expansion in the developing world. In the poorest nations, an internet connection is unaffordable for most. This won‚Äôt change as long as the necessary infrastructure remains expensive.

Countless people have died because they had no cellular connectivity to call for help.  
Lack of connection with the outside world dramatically adds to the monetary misfortune of the world‚Äôs poorest, closing doors to potential opportunities for lifting themselves out of poverty.

This is also bad for human civilization as a whole. Many geniuses came from impoverished backgrounds. There are currently hundreds of millions of children, many of them undoubtedly gifted - potential next Einsteins and Newtons and Elon Musks - with no internet access. Just imagine all their contributions if they were able to join the global academic and business community. There are historical cases of people with no formal training making substantial contributions to science, such as the fascinating story of Srinivasa Ramanujan \[[17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan)\].

## The solution: turn all phones into satellite phones

Cellular coverage and internet access go hand in hand. 92.8% of internet users use mobile devices to go online most of the time. There are 5.27 billion unique mobile users, increasing each year rapidly. \[[18](https://datareportal.com/global-digital-overview)\]

Today, only about 25 percent of the world‚Äôs landmass is served by cell towers, the rest has no coverage \[[19](https://lynk.world/our-technology)\]. Traditional terrestrial tower networks will never reach full global coverage, as there are no economic incentives to expand into low population density and low-income areas. For a solution, we must look to the sky.

Satellite constellations are magic made real. They provide robust wireless networks with global coverage at a fraction of the cost of traditional terrestrial towers. The satellites can easily cover the whole planet, including the most impoverished regions. The services can then be priced accordingly in each region to be affordable by locals.

Many understand the gravity of the global connectivity problem and the economic opportunity that it presents. Recent technology advancements and the rapid decrease of payload to orbit costs started a commercial space race. Starlink from Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX and Project Kupier from Amazon are some of the most prominent players.

However, even the most advanced satellite constellations are of no benefit to those who can‚Äôt afford their services. Nearly all existing services require customers to purchase expensive hardware such as satellite phones (&gt;$1,000 for Iridium sat phone) or mounted terminals with powered antennas ($599 for a Starlink terminal \[[20](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22991841/spacex-starlink-price-hike-inflation-user-terminal)\]).

For this reason, a space-based cellular broadband network which works with regular phones that people already own is the holy grail.

## The opportunity: it‚Äôs still early for AST SpaceMobile stock

Until recently, the technology of direct satellite to unmodified mobile phone communication has been the stuff of imagination. AST SpaceMobile (ticker: ASTS) is now making it a reality.

AST SpaceMobile has the first-mover advantage, nearly $500M funding, unique product, over 2400 patent claims \[[5](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1780312/000095017022010109/asts-ex99_1.htm)\] and exclusive commercial agreements with Vodafone/Rakuten/AT&amp;T \[[21](https://www.satellitetoday.com/telecom/2022/04/10/ast-spacemobile-cso-details-companys-challenge-to-the-satellite-to-cell-paradigm/)\] and other big players which allows it to target billions of customers almost instantly once their satellites get deployed.

It already proved their solution works by establishing space communication with their prototype satellite.

This in-depth report will analyze the AST SpaceMobile ($ASTS \[[22](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24asts)\]) stock as an investment.

We believe that if the company succeeds in its mission, it could bring shareholders eye-popping returns by 2030, e.g. as much as 50x\~ from a $10¬± entry price. This report explains how.

At Transhumanica Research, we focus precisely on opportunities like this: high pro-social returns for humanity and high potential financial rewards for visionary investors in our community.

We believe that ASTS has all the ingredients necessary to become a ‚Äúcult stock‚Äù.

This one is a sleeper. You probably have never heard of it. Neither did I until it alerted on my scanner a week ago. Something strange is brewing here. Read on for more details.

**Why do you care?**

**The short interest on this is insane.** Yahoo Finance shows over 80% short of float. Someone has been gobbling up shares of this over the last week. It alerted on one of my scanners last week and since then I have been loading up on various strikes. It's getting to a point where it is going to boil over. **It's off a recent high of $35.**

**Something is brewing**

This stock is off a high of $35 back in March 22. The stock began its decline after an earnings miss. Since then, SI has been steadily increasing. Yahoo Finance shows over 80% short of float.

It seems to be setting up for....something. Price action in the last week is consistent with short covering. I believe as the price continues to trickle upwards, the shorts will be exposed and this could squeeze to $25-30.

**Insane IV**

The options market is pricing in some sort of mega move by 9/16. **The implied volatility on the $2.50 9/16 strikes is 581!** These strikes have some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options.

**My positions**

Various September and October dated strikes from $15-25. Heavily weighted on the $15 and $17 strikes. Good luck.

**UPDATE 9/12**

For anyone still watching this. I sold a big portion of my $15 strikes Friday at the close for a nice profit. I always advise people to take profits. I have a large position left in $15 and $17.5 strikes. The rest is all house money for me. I still believe this is setting up to be above $18 by EOW, but trimmed to lock in profits. This one may require a little patience. Good luck.

**Update 2** \- **9/12**

T. ROWE PRICE filed a 13f today with the SEC, indicating beneficial ownership above 7%. It looks like they may have been the buyer accumulating shares over the trailing 7 days. Will the buying continue? Possibly. Volume was dismal today which contributed to this closing down 1.6%. As indicated, I did sell a good chunk of my $15 strikes Friday and EOD. Going to let the rest ride at least into 9/16. I am still sitting on a large number of $15 and $17.50 strikes.

Implied volatility on the 9/16 $2.50 strikes is now at 741. This indicates that the options market is now pricing in a move above $20 by 9/16.

[15 August SEC filing](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/b08a4b0d-b9fd-467e-a69e-0e96c990ff45), signed by Ryan Cohen declaring that he owns almost 7.8m BBBY shares, plus option contracts for another 1.7m BBBY shares. 

[16 August SEC filing](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/52e1b74d-de71-4866-ab9d-b8e7b5c35d52), again signed by Ryan Cohen, stating that he have a stake of 9.45m shares, inclusive of his option contracts exercise power (1.7m BBBY shares). It specifically states that *""After reasonable inquiry and to the best of his knowledge and belief, each of the undersigned certifies that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete and correct.""*

According to the 2 SEC filings, RC owned his total BBBY stake on the 16th August. The above filings were submitted through the EDGAR SEC system, which makes them publicly available instantly.

[Then on the 18th August filing](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/ffb05d0a-d5cf-496c-b15f-d1905d72379b), signed again by Ryan Cohen, we have a statement that he has sold all his shares and options on the 16th. The same date that he released the previous filing stating that he is still in possession of his BBBY stake. Again, this was filed via the EDGAR system making it publicly available instantly.

However, due to his large stake in the company, he could not sell without declaring his intent to do so. Large shareholders are simply not allowed to sell their stakes without formally declaring it. So where is that filing?

Well, on the 16th August, he [filed an F144 form](https://sec.report/Form/144-PAPER/43719) declaring his intent to sell. It is worth noting that the F144 is a paper form, which means it is filled in by hand and does not become publicly available until months later when it gets digitized, unless, of course, someone specifically requests to see the fillings of the day for a particular company, scans it and uploads it online. There is no requirement to fill an F144 form to declare someone's intent to sell, they can file an EDGAR form online, as they have done with all their other filings to date. Ryan Cohen chose to file via EDGAR every time, except when it was to sell, knowing that the document would take a long time to become available online.

More important than everything else, he was filing statements that he owned his BBBY stake the same day he filed his intent to sell - and the same date he did sell.

Adam Neumann Is Back, This Time With a Cry*pto Angle

Flow, the controversial entrepreneur‚Äôs new real estate startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz, has plans to use cry*pto with its digital wallet. After Adam Neumann was very publicly ousted from his job as chief executive officer of WeWork Inc. in 2019, he stayed silent for a period, traveling with his family and giving few interviews as people produced books, podcasts, and fictional TV shows about his dramatic fall from glory. Three years later, it‚Äôs clear that Neumann picked up a new interest during his post-WeWork hibernation: cry*pto.

Neumann has helped found two separate startups that involve cry*pto: Flow and Flowcarbon. (Neumann said recently that ‚Äúflow‚Äù is one of his favorite words.) Flowcarbon uses blockchain technology to track carbon credits, and Flow, which raised $350 million from Andreessen Horowitz in August, is a residential real estate company. Flow hasn‚Äôt made the details of its plan public, but they include a digital wallet for handling cry*ptocurrencies, according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified in discussing private information. The wallet would also offer other financial services, such as allowing users to connect a bank account.

During his time as the CEO of WeWork, Neumann faced allegations of excessive spending, conflicts of interest, and grandiose eccentricities‚Äîthen, after a failed attempt at an initial public offering, he left the company, which dropped from a private valuation of $47 billion to a public trading price today of about $3 billion. When Andreessen Horowitz announced it was investing in Flow, critics questioned why someone with Neumann‚Äôs track record should keep receiving checks.

Within the cry*pto industry, which has had no lack of outlandish personalities and shameless hucksterism, Neumann‚Äôs past does not seem to be raising many concerns. He‚Äôs ‚Äúa world-class founder,‚Äù says Michael Anderson, co-founder of cry*pto venture-capital firm Framework Ventures. After all, one of Neumann‚Äôs indisputable strengths is building hype: He raised billions from investors for WeWork and turned straightforward real estate subleasing into a headline-grabbing business adventure.

After a striking boom, the digital asset industry has been besieged this year by steep drops in token prices and dwindling interest from venture capitalists. It could use some of Neumann‚Äôs swagger right now. ‚ÄúIf he can build something as big as WeWork again, I think that will be really positive for our industry if there is an element of Web3,‚Äù says Anderson.

Neumann didn‚Äôt publicly show much interest in cry*pto before he resigned from WeWork. But the startups he co-founded are aligned with his past interests‚Äîand quirks, such as his spiritual energy. WeWork‚Äôs prospectus noted the company‚Äôs mission to ‚Äúelevate the world‚Äôs consciousness‚Äù and its belief in ‚Äúthe power of we.‚Äù That same ideology and mission has infused Flowcarbon, where Neumann and his wife, Rebekah Neumann, are among a group of five co-founders. (The pair don‚Äôt hold operational roles.) Flowcarbon uses a coin called the ‚ÄúGoddess Nature Token.‚Äù

Cry*pto could also provide a new way for Neumann to realize a lifelong interest of his: building (and selling) community. Neumann grew up in Israel on a kibbutz, and he incorporated its ideals of community and sharing when building WeWork. He waxed poetic about creating a ‚ÄúWe Generation‚Äù among his customers, and he spoke publicly about giving all WeWork employees equity in the company, no matter their role.

Cry*pto tokens offer a new way to build a sense of community among a large group of people. Flow investor Marc Andreessen hinted in a blog post at the company‚Äôs interest in connection, saying that ‚Äúgiving renters a sense of security, community, and genuine ownership has transformative power for our society.‚Äù

It‚Äôs unclear exactly what the cry*pto element of Flow will be, and plans for the wallet could change, but one possibility is a rewards program that uses blockchain, according to the people familiar with the startup. Flow currently has no plans to represent real estate ownership or rentals using cry*pto tokens, the people say.

This kind of rewards program could dovetail with Web3‚Äôs goal of fostering distributed communities. ‚ÄúIf your aim is to build a huge community, you know, tens, hundreds of thousands of people, then certainly cry*pto could make sense,‚Äù says Stan Miroshnik, partner and co-founder of 10T Holdings LLC, which has invested in digital asset exchanges Kraken and Gemini Trust Co. He‚Äôs curious to see what Neumann cooks up next. ‚ÄúI welcome innovation in all forms.‚Äù

For Miko Matsumura, general partner with cry*pto VC firm Gumi Cry*ptos Capital, Andreessen Horowitz‚Äôs investment in Flow gives a promising signal that there‚Äôs still capital flowing into cry*pto. And while giving Neumann a second chance may put some people off, investors pride themselves on doing things that run counter to conventional wisdom. ‚ÄúIf you are in the venture capital business, you can‚Äôt actually back normal people,‚Äù Matsumura says.

(Seriously)|"Guys I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that the only way to make money on the stock market is by inversing any play that you think makes sense, because I **guarantee** you it‚Äôs already priced in. There‚Äôs people with more money than all of us combined who know more than us and have no chance of getting slammed for insider trading, and if they DO get ‚Äúcaught‚Äù all they do is pay a fine or do a few years in prison, max. That‚Äôs not a dark money conspiracy, it‚Äôs just a fact of the game. 

Oh you‚Äôre going to make an earnings play? That‚Äôs been priced in for months and you only stand to gain if the results are wildly unexpected in the positive direction, the other 90% of the time you‚Äôll stay flat or lose money if the report is negative. Still skeptical? Think of how much loss porn we‚Äôve seen over the past weeks, 9/10 are losses and only 1 will be a crazy gain. Now imagine if they all said ‚ÄúWow I want to make this play, so let me do the opposite!‚Äù: 9/10 would be **gain** porn in that scenario. I challenge all of you, without spending a penny over the next 2 weeks, just document the plays you *would* make and see if they work out- if you‚Äôre losing on more than 50%, then congratulations you‚Äôve discovered the money printer of inversing yourself.

*How* do you effectively implement this strategy, you ask? Simply buy things when they seem like a bad idea!! 
- Buy ETFs of sectors that are in a slump, not at an ATH
- Buy stock in companies with a promising product that just don‚Äôt have any partnerships yet
- Whatever trend you observe leading up to an earnings call, buy an option in the opposite direction

t3_x954ci|1662654932|wallstreetbets|How to play student loan pause?|"Even though other people seem more focused on the fed rate and other shit, I believe that the actual driver of inflation is the student loan pause.

I don‚Äôt believe for a second that the stimulus could drive inflation the way it currently has. A part, yes, but we haven‚Äôt had a stimulus in a long time which would only cause one time effects.

Others want to point to oil prices. Remember last year when gas was still cheap? Inflation was still up. Gas is coming back down. Inflation is still up.

No, the biggest driver of inflation is the demographic most likely to spend money: educated folk with higher incomes.

This demographic has literally had extra monthly income for the past two years that they have been using on travel, luxury goods, and whatever else. You can see this with cars where the share of luxury new cars sold has grown since the pandemic. 

Someone with $40000 in student loan debt (typical college)  has an additional $400 each month to spend. Or $4800 per year.

Someone with $100000 (typical masters) has an additional $1000 each month to spend. Or $12000 per year.

Unlike poor people, they don‚Äôt need to save this money. Instead they are spending.

So when the student loan pause ends, demand will drop, inflation will drop (with very little to do with fed rate).

So how do you play the market? Will markets decline due to decline in demand?

Or will markets rally due to inflation being controlled?

Thoughts my fellow regards?

TLDR: Demand and inflation will crash when student loan pause ends. How play?"|0.36|0|0|0

Bezos is single. He uses the fact that he has an electric car company to pickup chicks at the club. Ladies like cool car stuff. Bezos' ego cannot let Elon be the only electric car billionaire guy because ""I'm the dude who ships you shit"" isn't a sexy enough enterprise on it's own to get chicks when at the club.

Because WSB has an attention span worse than a cocaine-addicted goldfish (shoutout Fredrick), I‚Äôll do the short-term first

**First, the Short-term:**

GBTG (a branch of American Express) recently IPO'd through a SPAC, which causes a lock-up period where both insiders at the company and PIPE investors can‚Äôt sell their shares. This makes the stock extremely volatile and susceptible to buying pressure

This effect is so extreme on this stock that the average volume traded is only around 60,000 shares, yet it has seen spikes of 10%+ in a single day.

What makes this even better is the fact that **over 10,000 options** have been sold for September 16th, with the majority at $10C.

[Source: Yahoo Finance \(3\)](https://preview.redd.it/yi4tseyq2nm91.jpg?width=1123&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d72b1318db82cb7a865bedd3328f16a410ce230)

Most of these options are OTM right now, but if the price rises at all, MM‚Äôs will have to purchase shares to delta hedge, which, in such a low-float and volatile stock, will cause further price increases and purchasing of shares. (6)

In total, up to 1 MILLION shares will need to be purchased in this process. For context, that is **16 TIMES the average volume traded**. This is FUCKING INSANE

Similar situations have happened in the past, but the difference between the OI and average volume in this stock is magnitudes greater than any other plays I have seen before. If any upwards momentum happens, this shit is gonna take off

This is designed to be a short-term play, but the long-term fundamentals of this are solid too

**Long-term + Fundamentals:**

GBTG has experienced over 200% revenue growth as it rapidly expands in the financial service and travel industry

[Source: Yahoo Finance \(7\)](https://preview.redd.it/hk2gin0v2nm91.jpg?width=820&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=116c8c74fb7fc556bd352d02af780c5a1955378f)

What makes GBTG different from its competitors is that it both services accounts and processes transactions. Their credit cards are geared specifically towards high net-worth individuals and people with excellent credit ratings, which makes their business much safer and less susceptible to economic downturns

GBTG has an average credit-card delinquency rate of only 0.8% (8), which is 2.25 times lower than the average CCDR (9)

As interest rates continue to rise, rates credit card companies charge consumers will increase (10), significantly increasing the CCDR of companies who issue cards and lend money to riskier consumers

[Source: Literally says on the picture dumbass](https://preview.redd.it/pysh7nnx2nm91.jpg?width=1453&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5000773a204ae96c0626ece1614cefc35390be84)

While not having a major impact on GBTG‚Äôs rate, which has held stable during this time period due to safe lending practices (11)

GBTG will be able to benefit from this by capturing further market share as competitors cut costs while defaults eat away at their earnings

This extreme growth and move towards profitability is slated to continue as they complete more deals with travel-related industries to lower costs, increase benefits, and capture more users

There are numerous other reasons why the long-term fundamentals of this company are incredible, but I gotta use my hands for something else after that juicy gain porn comes in so imma cap it off here...

The price of oil is both a cause and an effect of the crazy market conditions we're facing in 2022. Who could have picked a more contentious issue, energy security, as the top global foreign policy concern this time a couple years ago would have laughed.

On April 20th 2020, I was definitely blazing (weed is tight üì∑ ). That was also the day that you could have been *paid money* to buy a barrel of oil from someone. How far things have come in such a short time. I find it interesting that our market cycles are seemingly getting shorter and more violent as of late (maybe indicating the end of a longer term debt cycle? more retail investors flipping options?) than previous recessions and economic downturns

On the one hand, we're seeing astronomical costs for natural gas prices as Europe scrambles to secure replacement supplies after Russia cuts off the Nord Stream 1 pipeline entirely.

 I even saw this UK game show offering to pay people's utility bills for 4 months as a prize [https://www.businessinsider.com/uk-tv-wheel-of-fortune-prize-energy-bills-prize-crisis-2022-9](https://www.businessinsider.com/uk-tv-wheel-of-fortune-prize-energy-bills-prize-crisis-2022-9) (not sure if this was satire or not)

But on the other hand we have the backdrop of a global recession becoming ever more likely by the day, with many economic indicators signaling that central banks will not be messing around with inflation regardless of what effects their QT policies will have on growth (edited)

# Market Factors to Watch

**Europe is a Mess**

Europe is currently a fucking mess. Seriously, if you haven't been following it, go check it out. Factories and businesses have to shut down completely during rolling blackout periods; that's real businesses having to cut into their bottom lines because they have to turn away customers or miss other opportunities. Europe is understandably worried about this situation. They know that asking their citizens to pay these insane costs is unsustainable.

In some cases, utility bills are more than 20% of people's entire yearly take-home income. There are various takes about the efficacy of different avenues proposed to navigate out of this mess. One of these methods is to pay the energy companies directly, or pay indirectly by giving financial stimulus to their citizens

**Russian Oil Price Cap**

One such proposal that sounds better the more I've considered it is a price cap on Russian oil. The thinking is, Russia is still selling its oil on the global markets despite attempts to shame the world into embargoing them. Albeit for cheaper prices, but they're still able to make a profit and fund their war in Ukraine.

Setting a price cap would ""prevent"" countries from paying more than a certain price, much lower than they are currently getting, when purchasing from Russia. The price cap would work because enough countries would sign onto the agreement where Russia would have no choice but to accept the terms of lower priced sales from those countries.

Then other countries that are not participants would have better negotiating power for lower prices themselves. By squeezing Pooty's margins, it slows their war efforts *and* lowers the global price of oil in the process.

How the Oil Cap Works: [https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/09/06/russia-oil-price-cap-putin-war-sanctions-energy-g7-europe-crisis/](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/09/06/russia-oil-price-cap-putin-war-sanctions-energy-g7-europe-crisis/)

**OPEC Profiteering**

Whether it's government subsidies or Putin Price Caps, or just simply the likelihood of a recession causing significant demand destruction (remember, markets try to be forward looking), there are many reasons for the price of oil to end its massive rally that started that Weed Day, 2020 (see the chart below).

But **not to worry**, OPEC is on the case! As you can imagine, OPEC has enjoyed a profit windfall resulting from recent market conditions. They knew that the world got too cocky with their promises of a Green Energy Revolution, and their bets have paid off. ""Cute windmills"" OPEC said (not bashing the green movement at all whatsoever, but my true belief is that Russia caught the world with its pants down on this energy thing in the short term, and OPEC has been a huge beneficiary)

So now OPEC wants to keep the party going, of course. Just this week, they reversed course on plans to keep production at current levels, deciding instead to cut production by 100,000 barrels per day as they see the price of oil starting to fall.

# What's Next?

All in all, energy prices will be key for whatever is to come for 2HFY22. Oil stocks have been some of the strongest this year, so if those start to tank then there won't be much holding SPX above these key levels.

Analyst Brian Lee upgraded shares of the stock to buy from to sell and stated in a Wednesday note to clients that he believes the company will be a long-term beneficiary of the bill‚Äôs solar panel manufacturing credits.

He wrote that FSLR is one of the most levered to US demand tailwinds in our solar panel supplier coverage. The US accounts for approximately 80% of the company‚Äôs revenue. The climate bill ‚Äî formally known as the Inflation Reduction Act ‚Äî offers rebates and tax credits to consumers for climate-focused products such as electric vehicles and solar panel roof installations, while aiming to incentivize the manufacturing of clean energy products at home .

First Solar last month announced that it would invest up $1 billion to construct a new U.S. solar panel manufacturing plant. Markets have been impressed by the sector since its passage. Goldman‚Äôs coverage of solar companies has seen a rise of 30% to 40% in shares, and First Solar is no exception. We are pleased to report that our upgrade was not too early. Lee noted that the stock is up 64% in the six months since IRA legislation was introduced, but that there are still some upsides to what has quickly became a domestic solar manufacturing champ across our coverage.

Lee also anticipates more upside in 2023, 2024, as more people revise their estimates moving forward. First Solar shares have risen nearly 55% in the past year, but could rise another 28% from Wednesday‚Äôs closing. This is based on the bank‚Äôs $172 price target. Lee upgraded Maxeon Solar Technologies‚Äô status to buy, while downgrading Canadian Solar and Shoals Technologies Group shares.

t3_x8xnnc|1662635459|wallstreetbets|Some Interesting Takeaways from Living in a Country with Very High Inflation!|"**This is going to be a long post. No TL;DR. Please read at leisure.**

Hello,

So about two weeks ago, I had made a post where I had compiled the interest rates of various countries and Argentina had topped that list with an interest rate of 60%.

[Link to the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/wz06js/the_central_bank_of_argentinas_interest_rate_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

**What followed were interesting questions, answers, and insights! Especially about Argentina, because a Redditor who was an Argentine and into finance commented and responded to many questions (most were mine as I got really intrigued). Another Redditor who was also an Argentine chipped in, and both these Redditors made the whole post very insightful.**

**Shoutout to** [**u/Drorta**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Drorta/) **and** [**u/JFSM01**](https://www.reddit.com/user/JFSM01/)**. Your insights were awesome!**

**I had originally posted the following questions to these Redditors** \- 

1. What are the rates of interest on personal loans?
2. What are the rates of interest on mortgages?
3. What are the rates of interest on vehicle finance?
4. What rates of interest do you guys actually get when depositing in banks? Or do you guys even deposit in banks, or it just doesn't make sense?
5. Do prices of everyday goods actually change everyday/every week?
6. Do you guys use any other currency or any stable **""tip-toe""(can't use the word so used a rhyming word)** for your transaction that offers more stability?
7. Do you guys use more digital transactions/card transactions rather than cash because it gets burdensome and could be dangerous to walk around with that kind of cash?
8. What in your opinion has led to multiple defaults and such high inflations?
9. Do the youth believe in a better and brighter future? Or do they prefer moving out to another country or another continent?
10. What are your thoughts on inflation, interest rates, and the future of Argentina?

&amp;#x200B;

**A few of their answers collated and not in the order of the questions** \- 

* Rates on term deposits are about 70%. Personal loans are at about 90% and mortgage is at about 120%. Some special purpose business loans are lesser than the inflation rate. The mortgage market isn't that big, because nobody wants to lend out that far in the future, no matter the rate they receive.
* When mortgages are given out, the tenure is usually 5 - 7 years and they are reserved for businesses or high cash flow situations
* People don't usually do term deposits because the money needs to be locked up and people don't want that. Because in the past 3 months, the Peso depreciated against the USD by about 40%, so people find it risky. And also, in the past the Government has just taken their money from their accounts, so no trust.
* Prices of goods actually change everyday and they use stable currencies such as the USD, for storing of value. One of the Redditors has a Construction Materials Business and these are their exact words - "" I have a construction materials retail business. **I change prices every day**. Some of my providers will send weekly price lists, some monthly, some just whenever they feel like it. **Supermarkets like Walmart have employees just for re-labeling prices**.""
* They use a lot of digital and card transactions because otherwise they would need to walk around with a lot of cash. Another quote from the same Redditor who has the Construction Materials Business - "" **Our biggest denomination bill is effectively a 3 dollar bill. So If you want to buy anything relevant with cash, you have to carry loads of it. Like I said I own a retail business, I have an employee that carries backpacks full of cash to the bank daily**.""
* The youth are moving out of the country to work somewhere else (especially the educated ones). And many try to get a job with remote working benefits and that pays in USD. So they earn in USD but spend in Pesos and as the value of the Peso drops, they basically just make a higher wage because their money is in USD.

**Then these were some follow up questions to their responses** \- 

1. So do people even borrow at those rates? Because one has to literally pay back twice the amount in like 14 months. I understand the whole point of such high rates is to curb lending, but the ones who borrow (retail or commercial) might be having some crazy amount of earning power in a year because they need to basically earn twice and pay back and even have a profit (in the case of a business)
2. If mortgages are so high, I believe mortgages might not be a thing in Argentina, right? So everyone buys in cash? And how dead is the real estate industry? Because if with these rates it is thriving then it‚Äôs crazy and I would definitely look into and probably even come up with some investment thesis.
3. So do people deposit with banks or just let it be?
4. What apps or services are the most famous out there? Like is it MasterCard/Visa or some other big name brand or some other brand which is more local or Lat-Am based?
5. But the ones that are moving out, are they sending money back to their families or sending money back to the family isn‚Äôt in the culture? And also, the ones that move out, do they buy real estate in their home country?

**To which their responses were** \- 

* People still borrow at those rates because they exchange the Pesos to USD in the black market and then wait a few months for the Peso to depreciate and then convert back again and pay the loan. In the process they make a nice gain. So people borrow to speculate on the currency and not for spending or investments.
* **The Redditor with the Construction Materials Business quotes - "" Retail or Commercial will not have that hard a time repaying, considering their own prices rise all the time. My own business is selling with 84% growth YoY, but at least 60% of that is inflation. "" (*****My personal key takeaway here - we all have read about how businesses with pricing power do well during times of inflation compared to other industries or compared to other companies in the same industry who do not have pricing power. This here is proof!*****)**
* Quote from the Redditor with the Construction Materials Business on my question regarding Real Estate - "" Most real estate deals are done in cash and in USD. The real estate market is my field of expertise. It's a lot slower for sure. However, keep in mind the following: the peso devalues fast. US dollar bills can be bought as a reserve of value, but due to a number of regulations, it has to be bought under the table. **If you have a cash generating business, where do you go to store your value? bingo, to real estate. A LOT of the movement in real estate isn't people buying their homes. It's just people's way of saving money. It's a somewhat solid store of value**.""
* People don't deposit in banks but rather spend or invest it or buy USD. Nobody holds Pesos, as it burns in their hands.
*  Mercado Libre is the leader in payment apps
* Quote from the other Redditor on my question regarding sending money back to family - "" Yes, they do but its really fucked up because the gov automatically liquidates the dollars on arrival and sends pesos.""

**More follow up questions to the responses above** \- 

1. Wow! You know for this to be right and be profitable, the Peso should depreciate against the USD more than the interest rate in a year? But I believe that already happens and hence people are doing this. But tbh, the more people do this, the more the peso gets weaker, because all they are really doing is betting against the Peso.
2. That‚Äôs a very risky thing to do honestly. Because in the very unlikely case that the peso gets stronger against the USD, people will get burnt. And they probably might rush to convert back, making the peso even more stronger. It‚Äôs actually a double edged sword and works both ways.
3. So if the govt. is doing this, aren‚Äôt the people not sending through normal channels and possibly sending only USD on Mercado Pago?

**To which their responses were** \- 

* The government would just print more Pesos in the unlikely scenario that the Peso starts getting stronger than the USD. And the people are sure that they won't get burnt because historically the Peso has only depreciated against the USD.
* Quote from the Redditor with the Construction Materials Business on my question regarding transacting money on apps and other digital transactions - "" This is a more complicated scenario. ""**Tip-toe**"" is being used a lot to move money in USD in and out of Argentina. Also platforms like PayPal, Payoneer, Wise, etc. **On the other hand, if you have money outside the US, and need pesos here, why bring the money? just ""sell"" your money outside, to someone that wants it outside. Anyone generating money here is looking to move it abroad. So they pay with pesos to anyone that has dollars abroad in any platform, effectively never letting those dollars enter the Argentinean economy.**""

&amp;#x200B;

And one of my last questions (kept it for the last because the response blew my mind as it was something unexpected and something I never ever thought of) was - 

 1. So then only real estate becomes the option of an inflation hedge? 

To which the response by the Redditor with the Construction Materials Business was - 

"" yes, pretty much. Different people use different things as a value reserve, with different benefits. I was just a kid when we had hyper inflation, were talking 100% per month. **My dad bought used cars as a reserve, and sold them when he need money. Not a great here but pretty liquid**.""

&amp;#x200B;

**This is just so enterprising. Necessity is definitely the mother of innovation!**

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/wz06js/comment/ilzy9rg/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) if someone is interested in reading the whole thread verbatim.

If we ever have high inflation (hopefully not as high as Argentina) then some of the points mentioned above can be used in our context. Our context being the country we live in and our financial situation. I personally would trade second hand cars, because where I live, cars are a big thing.

Anyway, hope you had a good read, Cheers! :)"|0.73|19|0|19

What makes this better then any old boring SPAC merging with a company you've never heard of?

.. lets start with post-merger conditions.. 95% of share dilution will be under a 1 year lockup. (insiders/and PIPE). There's price target incentives at $15 and $17.50 (after the shares are paid out, the marketcap will have roughly a 1B bump up).. 

From 2.4B marketcap at merger (@ $10 per share), to 3.6B with the added ""bonus"" shares.

The bonus shares for each price target need to hold for 20 days within a 30 day window (straight), to be paid out.

Rumble is experiencing MASSIVE month-month / yearly growth. (currently 78M monthly average users for the month of August)

As more and more creators look for safe haven from being YouTube banned (because of politics/science/etc), they take shelter at Rumble, the ONLY free-speech platform, that is professional and lets you speak openly (within the boundaries of the law). 

Andrew Tate was recently banned off essentially ALL media platforms, (they all banded together and cancelled him), so he joined Rumble, and expressed why Rumble is important, and that everyone needs a company like Rumble to fight against Big-tech, so people can have their own opinions without being cancelled. He has asked everyone to rally together and Join Rumble, and create accounts there.

This has opened up the doors to entirely new demographic of user starting to join, and now with hints of Stevewilldoit/Nelk/Fullsend Being next up to join, due to cancellation.

More and more creators will start cross-posting their YouTube channels to Rumble, as just another source of revenue, whether they're cancelled or not. This will in turn spike the Monthly average users and ad revenue through the roof, and open the doors to more channels being cross-posted.

The company has a host of investors behind it, the most notable is Peter Thiel. This is his first media investment since Facebook. 

Rumble will be entering the cloud service space in the next year or so, they're already expanding what they currently have. (Truth Social from TMTG) is currently running on their cloud service infrastructure, and in the next year or so Rumble will open the doors to be commercially available. They also have a payment processor that is free of big-tech, and are in talks of a web browser.

They are advertising as being the ONLY free-speech, anti-censorship media platform AND hosting infrastructure on the markets. which IMO will be MASSIVE. These niche companies will always be a standout, especially if they have non-stop rolling catalysts from big youtube creators joining the platform in the process.

Rumble is a real pillar in the free-speech sector. They're even suing Google currently for 2B+ in damages, for google routing search results to YouTube, rather then other (smaller) video platforms like Rumble. You can search for a Rumble video SPECIFICALLY on google and it will bring up a YouTube video. Which is illegally favoring their own businesses. Rumble has now entered a stage in the lawsuit where Google will have to provide how their algorithms work when searching for things, to ensure they aren't favoring their own businesses (which they clearly are).. This could be a MASSIVE discovery.

Rumble plans on taking Marketshare from:

YouTube/google, AWS, Azure, and they're releasing tiktok format videos. 

With Trump, Andrew Tate, and a host of other notable creators likely to join, all backed by a free-speech driven CEO, this just screams ""meme"" status, but with real sentimental value.

I predict with the locked up float, retail hype, and whatever news they'll drop around merger time, that we see a run towards $50 (similar to BRCC or Lucid)"|0.68|19|0|19

We are 2 years in and 20% are direct registered.  Is the plan to DRS the remainder over the next 8 years?

Regarding the numbers.  Revenue down means a business is shrinking; not only that GME went into this quarter with almost double the normal level of inventory, so sales should have crushed the prior year's numbers.  Expenses down to me means employees are simply leaving.  The stock compensation plan to me seems to be a way of conserving cash.  I doubt employees really car about stock; I know they'd rather have cash.   Most importantly, GME shows no sign of becoming profitable.

The plan to turn around the company is based on NFTs for gaming.  I don't see how games are going to be introduced on this platform versus competitors with far more resources.  Its a pipe dream

Sure the company has cash of $900 million, but it is valued at $7.3 billion.   Where does someone come to the conclusion that the balance of the company is worth $6.4 billion?

I expected this quarters numbers to suck as they did, and expected expenses to be light just from reading about how unhappy the store level staff is but I'm honestly amazed people somehow are bullish?  This plan is also based on a coordinated team squeeze  seems like a delusional pipe dream to me.    Of all the stocks in the world to focus on, I just don't get the obsession with this company.

I will start with energy, because that is where the economy starts. Everything is energy. All production, all consumption. Debt is just a claim on future energy/resources, and is typically purchased on the expectation of repayment of principal/interest (money is just tokenized energy), based upon an expectation of real economic growth of the debt issuer (assuming interest rates are positive). When you live in a world where everyone has more energy to use and consume on an annualized basis, economies see real growth. The opposite also usually holds true, absent financialization tricks to mask the decline. So, where are we today? Conveniently BP has excellent data on this stuff going back to 1965, and keeps it here:

[https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html)

You can download a spreadsheet there called ‚ÄúStatistical Review of World Energy ‚Äì all data, 1965-2021.‚Äù It has a handy tab called ‚ÄúPrimary Energy ‚Äì Cons capita,‚Äù which tells you what the annual per capita consumption of energy is in gigajoules, broken out into various geographic groupings. Here is what that looks like for roughly the first decade of data: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x1ktkb4w0jm91.png?width=1227&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61b950b10e1cbcea873d19c403181ae0fa061f53

  

Notice how energy consumption per capita is trending upwards from 1965 to 1973? Those were pretty good times.  America had cheap and abundant domestically produced conventional onshore crude oil, and a massive manufacturing base that thrived off of it in the glory days after WWII when we dominated pretty much every market that existed. Unfortunately, in 1973 this thing called an energy crisis happened, as our conventional production was going into decline, and Europe, Japan, and other economic competitors were back on their feet after WWII and seeking to increase their share of the economic pie (using energy). 

Note the consistent declines in global energy consumption per capita and OECD consumption per capita during 1974 and 1975. So, what did the S&amp;P 500 do in 1973 when this energy crisis suddenly arrived on the market? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pfhx27e01jm91.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1408e4cdce1f14c650e20cf0929fa13d90efb585

  

From January ‚Äô73 to October ‚Äô74, the S&amp;P 500 lost about half of its value. Business plans, debt, and earnings all ran into the hard wall of an energy crunch and reset market expectations as inflation driven by energy shortages reared its ugly head.  The E on the P/E side of the equation changed suddenly, and anything based on TTM or pre-crunch estimates was total garbage. 

Around this same timeframe, some relevant events also happened. In 1971, Nixon took us off the gold standard and ended the monetary system (Bretton Woods) that had existed since WWII ended.  Prior to that dollars could be exchanged for gold at a set rate, but some stagflation in 1971 made the whole system unstable and unworkable for America, so it had to go. By the time the energy crunch hit in 1973, the US knew it needed to do something to stabilize its supply of energy, its global reserve currency, and its access to real assets to fund future growth. So in July 1974, Nixon sends his new Treasury Secretary, former Salomon Brothers bond trader Bill Simon, to Saudi Arabia on a top secret mission. Bloomberg learned about it from a FOIA request decades later, and wrote a cool article about it:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-05-30/the-untold-story-behind-saudi-arabia-s-41-year-u-s-debt-secret](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-05-30/the-untold-story-behind-saudi-arabia-s-41-year-u-s-debt-secret)

Here‚Äôs the tl;dr on the article, from the article itself:

‚ÄúThe basic framework was strikingly simple. The U.S. would buy oil from Saudi Arabia and provide the kingdom military aid and equipment. In return, the Saudis would plow billions of their petrodollar revenue back into Treasuries and finance America‚Äôs spending‚Äù

That word petrodollar is also important. In early 1945 FDR entered into an alliance with Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia agreed to sell and price oil in dollars. Most other oil producing nations of the world quickly joined the club, and we liked this. If countries outside of the Soviet system needed energy to grow their economies, they needed reserves of dollars, and debt denominated in dollars. We will return to this topic later. 

So, we had obtained a fat stack of funding from the Saudis to dig our way out of this energy crisis thing.  The process was pretty rocky, resulting in the 1970s, but eventually this nice man named Paul Volcker ratcheted interest rates high enough so that the stagflation could be beaten into submission, while around the same time enough capital had reached E&amp;P companies to enable capex to flood the market with new cheap energy, turning boomtowns of the 1970s like Houston into ghost towns in the 1980s.  Newly developed offshore fields in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea pumped energy like it was going out of style, and the market had a really good time for about 20 years.

Since all of that energy came online in the early 1980s, global consumption per capita has generally trended upwards every year until 2018.  We kept finding new ways to economically pull oil and gas out of the ground (new fields, deepwater, fracking shale), and get it into the hands of consumers so they could use more of it to grow the economy. This lifted billions of people out of poverty, allowed the agricultural revolution to feed them with nitrogen fertilizers made from natural gas feedstock, and provided predictably priced (mostly) inputs for heavy industry. This was an all around great thing for business, and American Boomers as a group made a metric fuckton of money riding the wave during the entirety of their working lives.

So, what does the most recent decade of BP per capita energy consumption data look like? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ee84vir41jm91.png?width=1539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8acb71d9654f5848e6a26295e66affddd8696ec

  

Pretty much a plateau globally from 2011-16, small increase in 2016, top in 2018, and downwards trend since (with 2020 being a big down anomaly for obvious reasons).  There‚Äôs variation around that whether you look at OECD, EU, Non-OECD, but the peak for all of them is 2018. People have less energy to work with today than they did four years ago. 

Unless more energy gets injected into the system, it is very hard to stimulate real growth, and financial instruments (like bonds) that track anticipated real growth reflect that with high prices and low (or even negative) interest rates. In a world where everything is growing, I want my loans to at least reflect the real rate of economic growth, otherwise I am losing money.  Looked at bond yields over the past decade lately? They didn‚Äôt seem to be pricing in a lot of real growth at any duration.  Why do you think that is?

People can argue about the definition of peak oil all they want, but 2018 appears to be at least a localized peak when scaled to global population. The key to reversing this is producing enough energy at a reasonable price, so that people can start using more of it. That would reflect an economy that is growing in real terms. That takes lots of money. Which brings us to the next chapter of this story, a very brief overview of geopolitical stuff that happened from the fall of the Soviet Union to the recent start of World War III. 

The year is 1991, the Soviet Union falls and this country called Russia suddenly has a lot of available energy reserves that previously weren‚Äôt getting a lot of circulation outside of the walled-off Soviet Sphere. These abundant energy reserves were recognized immediately for what they could be: a giant engine of additional economic growth to fuel the 1990s and beyond. That‚Äôs what happened.  A country in Europe called Germany had this bright idea to build out a massive heavy industrial and manufacturing base, fueled by cheap Russian natural gas, which could easily be pipelined in from the fields in western Russia and eastern Ukraine. The plan worked, and Germany became an economic powerhouse with a massive trade surplus.  Germany did not control the energy it used, though, so its position was precarious. To make matters worse from an economic perspective, over time Germany decided it did not like cheap energy due to environmental concerns, and had this very intense political aversion to nuclear power (another cheap, energy-dense method of generating baseload electricity). So, Germany decided to get rid of its nuclear reactor fleet, reduce its number of coal powerplants, and replace them with natural gas power turbines for baseload electricity generation, supplemented by semi-reliable solar and wind power, which is not suitable for baseload generation. 

Eventually this brutal mafia boss named Putin takes over the country, and becomes President for Life of Russia‚Äôs energy reserves. He does not care for America, has actively sought to collapse us for decades, did not like the fact that he was forced to sell oil in dollars, and would do anything he thought he could get away with to make Russia strong vs. its competitors, especially America. 

Fast forward to his invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. The U.S./Eurozone/Allied response was to hit Putin and Russia with sanctions. Much like prior/existing sanctions on Iraqi or Iranian oil, these sanctions did nothing to actually keep his oil and gas off the market. Putin did not like the sanctions or Allied support for Ukrainians, so he decided to weaponize his most strategic resource: natural gas flows to Europe. Eventually we got to here, where Germany‚Äôs 30-year economic miracle died almost overnight: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kx4ympc81jm91.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fc1c5da1f48225830d4b015bad4be77f41d1915

  

That is decades of GDP that just got wiped out, on top of all sorts of weird multi-sigma anomalies like $1.5 Trillion margin calls in European electricity futures markets.  None of the stonks you own have priced in this reality.  Not even remotely.  Bonds have seen a ton of volatility (check the MOVE index), and it is really hard to find buyers for treasuries with this much uncertainty around future real economic growth prospects, while this thing called the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, and starting to sell lots of bonds into this market. 

There are billions upon billions of dollars of formerly productive assets sitting in Europe now, completely cut off from reasonably priced energy supplies that allow those assets to be economically competitive. Capitalism really does not like these sorts of inefficiencies, and is designed to fix them, so that costs of production can be as low as possible and competitive. It takes staggering amounts of resources and capital to just move production like that from where it is no longer competitive, to areas where it can be (like on the opposite side of the Atlantic, close to America‚Äôs and Canada‚Äôs abundant energy resources).  Russia probably wouldn‚Äôt mind buying that stuff at firesale prices and building out a manufacturing economy of its own next to its own energy resources, but America really would not like that, and the existence of sanctions makes that maneuver pretty difficult.  As far as America is concerned, we paid for all of that stuff through an investment called the Marshall Plan about 70 years ago, specifically so that Russia could not have it. 

And now we come to the Federal Reserve and the Petrodollar.  The federal reserve has only two priorities: (1) full employment; and (2) price stability. Employment is currently close to all-time highs.  Price stability is at a place not seen since the 1970s. As we have reached the edge of our petri dish during a supercycle of energy and economic growth, the fuel is dwindling, from both natural (depleting reserves) and unnatural (war) causes. The show simply cannot go on at these levels. We are constantly bumping up against the limits of energy, and it is creating chaos in the availability of reasonably priced energy, which affects commodities and food, which causes inflation, and which restricts real growth. The energy crunch is here.

You can‚Äôt just print more dollars and create more energy instantaneously. Europe is about to try by printing Euros to provide subsidies for energy that it doesn‚Äôt produce, which isn‚Äôt priced in Euros, alongside price caps over the world‚Äôs most essential commodity, which it doesn‚Äôt control. The UK is getting in on this act, too. This will cause two things: (1) hyperinflation; and (2) energy shortages and rationing. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e72wzpkc1jm91.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc5252a13cee26d535ac3bb6a134969d2d0c27c6

  

Meanwhile, that Putin guy is now demanding payment in Rubles for his oil and gas. He wants valuable real assets (foreign currency, hard assets, technology transfers, whatever) for his stuff, just like America gets from the Petrodollar.  He is also refusing to sell it to anyone who tries to cap the price of his stuff. This, more than the Ukraine invasion itself, has caused World War III. It is a direct attack on the supremacy of the Petrodollar, which America cannot abide. The Petrodollar is central to our national security strategy. Recently Saudi Arabia has entered the chat, and agreed to sell its oil to Europe and Asia at reduced rates (not fully priced in dollars). It is not clear to me at this point if this is a temporary relief valve to our allies to relieve forex pressures, or if the Saudis have allied with Putin.  The fog of war is real, and events are unfolding in real time, but markets hate uncertainty. 

Turning back quickly to the hyperinflation issue, what will be the effect of the European countries printing not-dollars to subsidize energy they don‚Äôt produce or control in sufficient quantities to meet their needs? The hyperinflation will definitely affect citizens and some businesses quite harshly (Goldman Sachs says 20%+ in the UK, and a government spokesperson affirmed that this was a reasonable estimate). It will also have the effect of concentrating national wealth in a handful of energy production and distribution related industries that are vital to the national security of those countries. Enter the Federal Reserve and America‚Äôs greatest weapon (we actually use it, unlike our nuclear stockpile): interest rates and the Petrodollar. 

Used properly interest rates and the petrodollar become a many birds with one stone solution to a lot of nagging problems. One, with recent large pro-Putin protests in the Czech Republic, Germany, and other Eurozone countries facing staggering and bankrupting energy bills, there is a risk that these countries could leave Team America, and try to cut a deal with Putin.  It would take a while to get past the sanctions, but where there‚Äôs political will there‚Äôs a way. This outcome is unacceptable to America and can never be permitted. 

As the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and sells its massive bond stockpile to combat inflation arising out of the energy crunch, much like it did in the 1970s, all sorts of second and third-order effects start happening, like sovereign debt crises. Countries keep reserves of dollars to buy energy, and as a result of regularly needing to transact in dollars, issue dollar-denominated debt. As interest rates in the US rise and bonds are sold, the global supply of dollars decreases. It is harder to get dollars, and foreign currencies dependent upon a stable or growing supply of dollars depreciate. They need to use more of their own currency to get the same amount of dollars that they used to. Much like the energy situation, a supply/demand imbalance arises. Also, quite a lot of the record high levels of corporate debt around the world are priced in dollars. That debt was also issued predicated upon growth assumptions that probably did not include an energy crisis, World War III, and stagflation. As you might imagine, this can cause a lot of problems. 

Why then, do you ask, would America keep raising rates and selling bonds when markets are screaming ‚Äúhey guys, big energy crisis over here, maybe turn on the liquidity a bit more‚Äù? Well, the amount of liquidity it would take to patch the gaping hole in German GDP is beyond anything we can reasonably do.  That would lead to hyperinflation in America, which can never be allowed. The only thing that truly threatens the accumulated wealth of a nation (which the Federal Reserve protects in America) is hyperinflation. It killed the Weimar Republic, and it will kill what we currently recognize as the European economy. The wealthy and wealth of this country can survive market crashes, but not hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is an economic weapon of mass destruction, and you just can‚Äôt predict the outcome with any reasonable certainty (other than real bad). 

Also, we are kinda tapped on liquidity after the Covid money fountain, and finding ourselves at the end of a business/debt cycle while we bump up against the chaotic limits of available energy. So, what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and sells bonds to continue tightening liquidity into this mess? Something in the global economy pops, starting in Europe (remember that $1.5 Trillion margin call in electricity futures). Hyperinflation destroys their economies, and they need a bailout/reset. In return for the bailout, we can give them the dollars they desperately want (we can create them at will). In return we only ask for all of their critical, national-security adjacent energy assets, which American capital can then operate for them starting from Europe‚Äôs new, lower baseline of reset economic growth. Some of the plant and equipment (natural gas turbines, very nice), along with intellectual property, can also be used to develop a more robust manufacturing economy here in America, close to comparatively cheap and abundant supplies of energy. We have done this with our allies before. In March of 1941, before America entered WWII, we sent the UK about 40 mothballed, decrepit destroyers from storage, and all we asked for in return was postwar dissolution of the British Empire and control over the global monetary system.  It was a really amazing deal for America. We have profited immensely. 

The other part of the puzzle is the staggering amounts of capital that will be needed to properly invest in energy and manufacturing infrastructure in America over the next decade. We basically have to onshore Germany, and replicate their trade balance that just vanished, plus some if we want actual growth. That is just a crazy amount of money, but we have to do it. The problem is that a huge chunk of our economy‚Äôs money is tied up in the stonks you retards have been buying hand over fist at a time when bond yields were screaming ‚ÄúNO REAL GROWTH.‚Äù Reversing this trend means inversing you. Your stonks gotta be crushed so that we can reset our growth baseline back to something reasonable, providing a multi-year runway of growth that will not bump up against energy limitations and make everything chaotic again. Once that happens, the Fed can turn the money spigot back on and the high interest rates will ensure that capital is allocated efficiently to the sectors where it will be most productive, like energy and manufacturing.

In the short to medium term this is going to be a rather volatile and unpleasant process, if you are not aware of what needs to happen. The old world of globalization is over. The heavy industry and production will be relocated here on our fortress continent, where we can keep our investment safe from bad actors like Russia in an increasingly dangerous world. The pivot is not coming until the reset happens. If you love America, sell your stonks and wait for the crash (or gamble on the timing of it like a degenerate with puts or UVXY, which I am doing), then go long as balls American treasuries, energy, manufacturing, and short dollars so the rest of the world can buy all the stuff we are about to make so we can all prosper. The Fed is on our side. You can make money in any market as long as you are flexible.

In the meantime I will conclude with a few fun bearporn centerfolds that I collected from around the internet:

The earnings compression that should follow the Fed moves to control inflation hasn't happened yet, which the market knows. After the Q2 lukewarm earnings, the market went bullish on sentiment. But as the recession pain sets in, companies have to report weaker earnings, lower dividends, lower future income expectations, hiring freezes, etc, and all of that has the potential to whiplash stock prices *if* this happens to a greater extent than the market anticipates. 

Maybe that hasn't happened yet in full swing. At the current stage we've only given back the bullish last few weeks, to reset back to the lukewarm earnings season around end of July. 

So anyone (such as myself) that think today's prices are the bottom, are basically saying 

 - they think the Fed has inflation under control
 - fed is gonna nail the ""soft landing"" exactly how the market expects
 - companies are going to have a profitable end of 2022 
 - no lowered guidance beyond what the market expected.

Rule 6.78-O specifies the circumstances under which OTP Holder and OTP Firms may effect transfers of positions, both on and off the trading floor, notwithstanding the general prohibition against off-floor transfers (discussed above).\[[17](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/07/2022-19227/self-regulatory-organizations-nyse-arca-inc-notice-of-filing-and-immediate-effectiveness-of-proposed#footnote-17-p54729)\] The Exchange proposes to adopt new Rule 6.78A-O, titled ‚ÄúOff-Floor Transfer of Positions,‚Äù which would set forth the permissible reasons for and procedures related to off-floor position transfers, but would not include the provisions related to on-floor position transfers. Proposed Rule 6.78A-O is substantively identical to the rules of other option exchanges regarding permissible off-floor transfers of options positions and would align Exchange rules with those of its competitors.\[[18](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/07/2022-19227/self-regulatory-organizations-nyse-arca-inc-notice-of-filing-and-immediate-effectiveness-of-proposed#footnote-18-p54729)\]

First, the on-floor position transfer procedure set forth in Rule 6.78-O(e) and (f) was designed to help OTP Holders and OTP Firms with a need to transfer positions in bulk as part of a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of its assets or options positions to obtain the best possible price for the positions while also ensuring that other OTP Holders and OTP Firms had an adequate opportunity to make bids and offers on the positions being transferred.\[[19](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/07/2022-19227/self-regulatory-organizations-nyse-arca-inc-notice-of-filing-and-immediate-effectiveness-of-proposed#footnote-19-p54729)\] In addition, the ‚Äúon-floor‚Äù position transfer procedure could be used by OTP Holders and OTP Firms that, for reasons other than a forced liquidation, such as an extended vacation, wished to liquidate their entire, or nearly their entire, open positions in a single set of transactions, subject to certain restrictions.\[[20](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/07/2022-19227/self-regulatory-organizations-nyse-arca-inc-notice-of-filing-and-immediate-effectiveness-of-proposed#footnote-20-p54729)\] Currently, because OTP Holders have been largely consolidated in the hands of firms rather than individuals, such transfers are, for the most part unnecessary; if an individual takes an extended vacation, another member of the firm handles the firm's book. Accordingly, the Exchange believes that the on-floor transfer of positions procedure no longer serves the uses for which it was originally adopted. Moreover, the process‚Äîwhich is only used on a limited basis‚Äîis nonetheless administratively burdensome on the Exchange. Further, other options exchange with a trading floor and a transfer of positions rule do not offer an on-floor transfer procedure.\[[21](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/07/2022-19227/self-regulatory-organizations-nyse-arca-inc-notice-of-filing-and-immediate-effectiveness-of-proposed#footnote-21-p54729)\]

Current Rule 6.78-O(d) lists the circumstances in which OTP Holders or OTP Firms may transfer their positions off the floor. The circumstances currently listed include: (i) the dissolution of a joint account in which the remaining OTP Holder or OTP Firm assumes the positions of the joint account; (ii) the dissolution of a corporation or partnership in which a former nominee of the corporation or partnership assumes the positions; (iii) positions transferred as part of an OTP Holder's or OTP Firm's capital contribution to a new joint account, partnership, or corporation; (iv) the donation of positions to a not-for-profit corporation; (v) the transfer of positions to a minor under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act; (vi) a merger or acquisition resulting in continuity of ownership or management; or (vii) consolidation of accounts within an OTP Holder or OTP Firm (the ‚Äúcurrent Exchange-permitted off-floor transfers‚Äù). As set forth below, the Exchange proposes to carry forward the current Exchange-permitted off-floor transfers into proposed Rule 6.78A-O and to add three new permissible circumstances.\[[22](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/07/2022-19227/self-regulatory-organizations-nyse-arca-inc-notice-of-filing-and-immediate-effectiveness-of-proposed#footnote-22-p54729)\]

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Stocks rose the most in about a month as Treasury yields paused their rise to multiyear highs, as traders digested remarks from a slew of Federal Reserve speakers. Oil fell, alleviating concerns about price pressures that could jeopardize the central bank's war on inflation.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Every major group in the S&amp;P 500 except energy rose, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outperformed, with only four members in the red. Apple rose after unveiling the latest version of its flagship product, the iPhone 14, relying on camera upgrades and a new emergency satellite-messaging feature to fend off rivals.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Oil benchmarks fell as demand concerns from China triggered a wave of selling as prices breached technical warning levels. West Texas Intermediate closed at less than $82 per barrel, while Brent closed at $88. The dollar fell following a rally that shook currencies around the world and briefly pushed gold below the ""danger zone"" of $1,700 per ounce.

Bears are now working on their 3rd leg of this large downtrend. I have two downside targets that I‚Äôm looking at. The first downside target is using the first leg measure.

The article further states that ""Freeman hinted that he didn't make an activist play at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond because Ryan Cohen, the activist investor and GameStop chairman, was already pushing for changes at the company."" To which freeman stated ""There is a phrase: Too many cooks in the kitchen.""

To which I say, obviously, Mr. Freeman just got lucky on making a large investment with his ""investor's""  (obviously his uncle's) money and had utterly no idea what he was actually doing for if he truly believed that Cohen was ""pushing for changes at the company"", why would he have bailed before Cohen actually implemented those changes? The answer is of course, that i'm sure Freeman realized that making $85 million off of someone else's money is not half bad when your 20 years old and in college.

While I am overall bearish still, there is now a potential V-bottom forming on the SPY daily chart. 

Key support remains at 391.9 for that ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù support line and key resistance for the downward red bear channel remains at 398.2 tomorrow. 

With only 2 1%+ green days in the last 16 trading days this is a much needed oversold bounce to reset the indicators and allow for the next leg down. Especially if you read my last night TA where I showed the probability that end of week and next week are red due to CPI/ FOMC (we still have no cpi consensus‚Ä¶).

If we break the red bear channel down I will get nervous about my 14dte puts, however, if we were to hold the blue resistance line from the 430 top I would not be as worried. There is a nice setup to have a similar trend as August 25th/ 26th with a nice 398 double top forming tomorrow. If markets are setting up similarly to the Jackson hole where they rallied into JPOW speaking only to dump like crazy intraday (he speaks at 910am) we could see a similar move tomorrow. However, there if of course always a chance we see a bigger bounce green and could retest 405 by EOW.

One of the major bearish things is that the daily 8ema was not broken‚Ä¶ I think the correct thesis remains bearish as long as that daily 8ema holds as resistance. 

Key support remains- 391.9 and 390.4

Key resistance remains- 398.2 and 405.2

https://preview.redd.it/bmd3idb8yhm91.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0328db8ab4919d733bf5f59aa6763aebc1963b8d

SPY weekly continues to hold that blue 13 week long recovery line (despite futures/ apple breaking theirs). We are still looking at a downward bear channel on the weekly which could give a potential bounce back to 412.4 (unlikely honestly) this week. 

Another thing to keep an eye on is the current 392.1 weekly candle double bottom that is attempting to form. 

https://preview.redd.it/q0c7llx8yhm91.png?width=831&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9be406cfa2f379b03e6e8e3c0db23b396c5501bf

Futures daily does not actually show the same v-bottom recovery as SPY. It just shows a near support bounce off that 3883 area to retest daily 8ema resistance before the next leg down. 

Key support- 3872

Key resistance- 3988 and 4000

https://preview.redd.it/f2jyhhh9yhm91.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1de98c728b3462d311d32528a09eb3f5e9f6015a

Futures weekly is also showing a possible weekly double bottom at 3923 forming if we were to not visit the lows before Fridays market close. 

Weekly resistance for this bear channel is 4000 tomorrow with next weekly level resistance at 4025. 

Weekly support is 3900 then 3828.

https://preview.redd.it/uf3kpy1ayhm91.png?width=939&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cec72f222b84e8da08467fbff9a94c5f615a7d6

Apple continues to remain the wild child. Intraday today and yesterday apple actually showed extreme weakness compared to the overall market and SPY. With apple only putting in a 0.93% green day compared to SPYs 1.8% green day Apple lagged most of the day. 

I believe part of that reason is that there was no sellers today on SPY hitting under 70mil currently with only 104% of the 30day average volume vs. Apple hitting 87mil and 127% of 30day average. Apple had a lot of sellers today. 

I was looking to see if Apple would close its back to back days under the daily 200ema, however, EOD it was able to pop its head over that resistance and couldn‚Äôt quite break down there. 

We saw a pretty healthy rejection at 156.5 today and we will continue to look at that as resistance. 

Key support- 155.5 (daily 200ema) -&gt; 154 -&gt; 152.2

Key resistance- 156.5 -&gt; 158.9 (red bear channel)

https://preview.redd.it/qx4jpjoayhm91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aec7b99fc4afa9d4db3561285570ef22bfa59292

Apples weekly chart continues to remain bearish. It shows that there is room for a potential pump as high as even 161 without breaking that bearish trend down. However, we should look for the weekly 20ema at 157 and weekly 8ema at 159.5 to be heavy resistance if we see upward movement. 

Key support remains at 154 and if we were to break 154 I would be looking for 150. 

https://preview.redd.it/qo8ol5abyhm91.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=935dc72646b736e38f711f59fd84a945ab70dee9

VIX had a pretty large 8.44% sell off day today on this very green market day. It still is holding the recovery channel upward with a trajectory for the 30s. Key level to watch tomorrow remains at 24.3. If that holds and they close it back over 25.5 that would put things back on track for a bigger sell off eow and next week. 

I will be posting my CPI breakdown post later tonight. If you read it you will see that I am overall bearish for Friday this week and the rest of next week as historically the week prior to FOMC is a big red week (with previous FOMC the only outlier).

I am still holding this put and I did average it down after closing bell today. I still see a bigger sell off to come within the next two weeks (most of it happening next week). I do not have plans to average this down again.

Tomorrow, we get yet another jobs report and as I said JPOW speaks ‚Äúat the CATO institutes 40th annual monetary conference.‚Äù What is he going to say? Im not sure but if its anything like Jackon Hole the market is not going to like it. With no CPI forecast still I still forsee a bearish tone from JPOW. There has not been a bullish fed member to speak in a very long time. And finally markets are actually listening to what JPOW is saying. Tomorrows opening is going to be SPICY‚Ä¶

Overall a great day for me today. Took a loss on that put when I suspected we were going to see a sell off around 1215 when we broke then 15min 8ema. Other then that I didn‚Äôt trade much after 1230 as while I clear saw the bull trend day and that it most likely after that 1215a bounce was not going to break‚Ä¶ I had a lot of trust in it and chose to just sit cash instead of trading something I had no conviction in.

The company also disclosed [a new partnership](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220907006127/en/) with exchange FTX.

Shares of the company rose more than 10% in after hours trading.

Here‚Äôs how the company did for the second fiscal quarter ended July 30:

* Loss:¬†$108.7 million, not comparable to estimates
* Revenue:¬†$1.14 billion

GameStop‚Äôs results cannot be compared with estimates because too few analysts cover the company.

The company did not provide an outlook. It hasn‚Äôt provided guidance since the start of the pandemic.

Bofa: **Next SPX support at 3810; tactical resistance 4015-4043** 

[bofa research](https://preview.redd.it/51v0hy83shm91.png?width=1092&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c3945f9259edde62fef8439f8fda347b3609359)

If 3900 gives way to bearish pressure, the SPX does not have support until the late Maylow near 3810.

The late June into mid July lows offer the next support at 3738-3712, buta break below the 61.8% retracement at 3899.84 would increase the risk for a full retracement back to the June YTD low at 3636.

The tactical pattern on the SPX remains weak below 4015-4043, which is nearby chart resistance and the 50-day and 100-day moving averages (MAs). Above 4015-4043 is needed to suggest a stronger tactical rally.

Sentiment: **Angst but not tactical capitulation**

Our last note suggested that capitulation levels for the 5-day CBOE total put/call on a spike up toward 1.2 or higher and the 3-month VIX vs the VIX on a spike below 1.0 may be needed for a tactical low in US equities.

The 5-day put/call and the 3-month VIX vs VIX have shown angst but not necessarily capitulation on moves to 1.13 and 1.019, respectively, as of Friday‚Äôs (9/2) close."|0.45|0|0|0

Mod note: Don't be a fucking cultist. 

It's cool if you like the stock, this thread was made for you!

Remember that this is a *trading* sub. Buying and holding shares for years is some boomer shit. Go back to r/investing. 

Some ground rules:

* don't make shit up 

* be intellectually honest, don't twist yourself to spin everything to be bullish

* don't aggressively try and recruit others.

If something is truly bullish then you don't need to bend backwards to try and justify it, it should be obvious. 

If people don't see what you see, double down on your position and take their money. 

Some speculation is okay, but conspiracy theories announced with undying enthusiasm and certainty will be called out for what they are.

When people laughed at DFV, he wasn't a dick, he didn't get aggressive, he reiterated his views on the fundamentals and laughed with them. 

He made money because he was right, not because he convinced redditor90210 to buy in.

Be like DFV or stay poor."|0.93|1182|0|1182

*The  $143 million contract is the largest spacecraft bus order placed with  Rocket Lab to date, encompassing the design and manufacture of 17  state-of-the-art spacecraft for Globalstar‚Äôs newest satellites*¬†

**Long Beach, California. 24 February 2022**  ‚Äì Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (‚ÄúRocket Lab‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Company‚Äù), a  global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced  that it has been awarded a subcontract by MDA Ltd (TSX: MDA), a leading  provider of advanced technology and services to the rapidly expanding  global space industry, to lead the design and manufacture of 17  spacecraft buses for Globalstar‚Äôs new Low Earth Orbit satellites.  Globalstar, Inc. (NYSE American: GSAT) is a leading provider of Mobile  Satellite Services including customizable satellite IoT solutions for  individuals and businesses globally.

Rocket Lab will lead the  development of the spacecraft buses, while MDA will act as prime  contractor to manufacture Globalstar‚Äôs satellites, lead the development  of the payload, and perform the final satellite assembly, integration,  and test. The partnership between Rocket Lab and MDA brings together two  of the space industry‚Äôs most innovative satellite companies. The total  initial contract value for Rocket Lab is US$143 million, with options to  provide the satellite operations control center, launch dispensers,  launch integration, and up to nine additional spacecraft with  flexibility in timing to order such spacecraft. The satellites will  integrate with and replenish Globalstar‚Äôs current constellation,  ensuring service continuity. Globalstar expects to launch the satellites  by the end of 2025.

‚ÄúWe are thrilled to be collaborating with MDA  to develop Globalstar‚Äôs new satellites and are honoured to have the  trust and support of two of the space industry‚Äôs most innovative  companies,‚Äù said Peter Beck, Founder and CEO of Rocket Lab. ‚ÄúWith this  contract Rocket Lab is executing on its strategy to go beyond launch and  lead the new space economy by delivering complete mission solutions  spanning spacecraft manufacture, satellite subsystems, flight software,  ground operations, and launch.‚Äù

‚ÄúCross-company collaboration and  co-development is key to bringing new capabilities to market quickly to  meet growing customer demand for advanced satellite technology,‚Äù said  Mike Greenley, CEO of MDA. ‚ÄúRocket Lab is a strong fit for MDA and  working with them on this system is an opportunity to flex, expand, and  strengthen the capabilities of both companies, now and in the future.‚Äù

All  17 of the 500kg spacecraft will be designed and manufactured at Rocket  Lab‚Äôs Long Beach production complex and headquarters, where a new  high-volume spacecraft manufacturing line is being developed to support  growing customer demand for Rocket Lab satellites. Leveraging Rocket  Lab‚Äôs vertically integrated space systems capabilities, the satellites  will feature components and subsystems produced by Rocket Lab‚Äôs recently  acquired companies including solar panels and structures from SolAero  Technologies in Albuquerque, New Mexico, software from ASI by Rocket Lab  in Denver, Colorado, and reaction wheels from Sinclair Interplanetary  in Toronto, Canada. The telemetry and control radio for all spacecraft  will also be a C-band variant of Rocket Lab‚Äôs Frontier Satellite Radio  (Frontier-C).

The contract is the result of a very detailed and  highly competitive bid and evaluation process and Rocket Lab is honoured  to have been selected by MDA. We believe Rocket Lab‚Äôs proposal met  MDA‚Äôs and Globalstar‚Äôs stringent technical and schedule requirements,  offered efficiencies through Rocket Lab‚Äôs high level of vertical  integration, and that there is also strong cultural and operational  alignment between the companies to deliver innovation and agility in  today‚Äôs satellite market.

Rocket Lab‚Äôs suite of spacecraft  components and subsystems include reaction wheels, star trackers, space  solar power, radios, flight software, ground software, and separation  systems. More than 1,000 spacecraft globally have successfully flown  with hardware from Rocket Lab and the four companies it has acquired  since 2020.

So it is reasonable to think it will hit 75$ before going back up. My point here is that it is inevitable that oil price goes up. I think it will follow the pattern we have been watching for the last year. 

With so much msm talking about a imminent crash, it would be the perfect time for oil to go up. 

So i think oil is still a good day trade at the moment. But i think sooner than later will be a good time to get a good position and watch it go up to 100‚Äôs

It‚Äôs pretty obvious it‚Äôs a safe loan that will be paid back, but the amounts are beyond normal banking facilities to provide.

Energy  companies can simply not afford to not sign up for the  possibility of  the loan (even if they‚Äôre not sure they actually need the  facility yet)  because bankruptcy is not an option if you‚Äôre servicing  heating for  the population and energy for companies to operate on. It‚Äôs  this need  to care for people that the Finnish government ‚Äì which is  supposed to  protect the population ‚Äì is strong arming the energy sector  to sign up  for these bizarre conditions.

To be sure: the Finnish government *take the 1% of the company and control payments whether a loan is taken out or not* and *even after repayment of the loan*.

They have potentially valued the energy sector in Finland at EUR 0,-.

The latest iPhone is expected to be slimmer, but with a larger screen. It‚Äôs rumored that Apple will debut a 6.7-inch phone that is not a Pro model ‚Äì meaning it will have the bigger size but not carry the higher price tag. That much-disliked notch around the front-facing camera system is also expected to go away. And Apple watchers forecast the company will ditch its cheaper, mini-sized iPhone as part of the 14 lineup.

Finally, expect a potentially major upgrade to camera quality with the latest iPhones, as some Apple watchers predict the 14 lineup will be the first of the company‚Äôs flagship smartphones to shoot 8K video.

It‚Äôs not just the iPhone. Apple is rumored to be unveiling multiple new Apple Watch models at Wednesday‚Äôs event, including a higher-end Pro model aimed specifically at sports and fitness enthusiasts.

Apple is also reportedly planning to roll out upgraded AirPod Pros, its higher-end wireless earbuds. The AirPods line has proven to be one of Apple‚Äôs bigger breakout successes in recent years.

Apple‚Äôs event invites are always closely scrutinized by Apple watchers for hidden meanings This year, the invite features a night sky with a constellation of stars forming the Apple logo and the tag line: ‚ÄúFar out.‚Äù 

This has led some to speculate there could be major camera upgrades to the iPhone, potentially allowing for better nighttime or long-distance photography. Apple, of course, has been sparse on details.

While the iPhone 14 is expected to be front and center, some other hardware announcements are less likely.

Many analysts believe Apple will wait to unveil new iPads and Mac computers at a separate event, possibly next month. Apple is also generally not expected to unveil its long-rumored and much-anticipated AR headset.

Apple‚Äôs stock has been a lemon this year. Shares are down more than 10% so far in 2022, and Apple is trading about 15% below the all-time high it hit in early January.

But with new iPhones set to be revealed Wednesday, will expectations for strong holiday sales ‚Äî and all the subscription revenue that comes with that ‚Äî be enough to turn Apple‚Äôs stock from red to green?

Investors appear to be betting that the newest batch of iPhones will lead to solid jumps in profits for Apple. 

Analysts are forecasting earnings per share increases of nearly 9% for this fiscal year and about 6% for 2023, respectable returns for a company as large as Apple. The tech giant is expected to generate $392.5 billion in sales this year and Apple is the world‚Äôs most valuable company, with a market capitalization of $2.5 trillion.

The company generates a huge amount of money from a new line of iPhones as existing customers upgrade and some holdouts make the switch from Android devices. Apple also rakes in big bucks from its lucrative services unit, subscriptions for iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV+ and other perks for iPhone, iPad and Mac users.

One analyst thinks that more iPhone users than usual will look to get a new device following this launch. That's because many customers seem to have been holding on to iPhones for longer periods of time before getting upgrades. (This reporter has stubbornly kept his ancient iPhone 8 Plus, partly out of fear of losing the home button.) The release of new devices may prompt those users to finally upgrade.
Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives noted in a report that Apple's initial order for 90 million iPhone 14 units is roughly flat compared to what it had ordered for the iPhone 13, even with ""macro storm clouds building."" So Apple clearly still expects its devices to sell even as consumer spending slows more broadly.
""This speaks to the underlying demand story that Apple anticipates for this next iPhone release with our estimates that 240 million of 1 billion iPhone users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over 3.5 years,"" Ives added.
Apple also benefits from the fact that it is a stock that is loved not just by individual investors but also by the giants of Wall Street.
According to research from market strategists at Goldman Sachs, Apple was a top pick of both mutual funds and hedge funds as of the end of the second quarter, along with other megacap tech companies including Amazon, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).
Apple is that rare beast, a stock that still is exciting enough for the growth crowd but is also attractive to value investors thanks to its reasonable price, penchant for stock buybacks to boost earnings and a steadily growing dividend."|0.73|19|0|19

The decision follows a hearing yesterday afternoon that saw Musk‚Äôs attorneys argue for a ‚Äúmeager‚Äù few weeks to review new information before the trial‚Äôs October 17th start date. Twitter, meanwhile, accused Musk of trying to drag out the trial and ‚Äúsow chaos‚Äù with more document requests ‚Äî claiming at one point that its lawyers had been forced to pause responding to international law enforcement requests.

Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick said that Musk should be granted wide latitude to amend claims before the trial starts, overruling Twitter‚Äôs objections, although she said she was ‚Äúreticent to say more concerning the merits of the counterclaims‚Äù before the litigation. Musk and Twitter will negotiate on ‚Äúlimited‚Äù discovery of new documents related to Zatko‚Äôs allegations, which include a variety of claims about poor management at Twitter as well as assertions that executives lied about the number of bots on the platform.

‚ÄúTHE COMPANY HAS BEEN FORCED FOR MONTHS TO MANAGE UNDER THE CONSTRAINS OF A REPUDIATED MERGER AGREEMENT‚Äù

However, McCormick said that Twitter would be unduly harmed by a delay in the trial ‚Äî which Musk had initially pushed to schedule next year. ‚ÄúThe company has been forced for months to manage under the constrains of a repudiated merger agreement,‚Äù wrote McCormick. ‚ÄúI am convinced that even four weeks‚Äô delay would risk further harm to Twitter too great to justify.‚Äù

The ruling is consistent with McCormick‚Äôs earlier push for a fast trial, but the decision to allow the whistleblower‚Äôs claims strengthens Musk‚Äôs case ‚Äî albeit in ways that aren‚Äôt necessarily fatal to Twitter. Musk initially said he suspended the deal because he‚Äôd discovered a far larger number of bots on the platform than he expected, but at the trial, he‚Äôs likely to argue that Twitter concealed ‚Äúmaterial adverse effects‚Äù potentially beyond the scope of bots, thanks to Zatko‚Äôs disclosures.

Meanwhile, Twitter has subpoenaed a wide range of Musk allies and argued that Musk got cold feet that have nothing to do with bots. At the hearing, it pointed to a text message urging his banker to ‚Äúslow down‚Äù the deal for a few days while evaluating a speech by Russian President Vladimir Putin. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt make sense to buy Twitter if we‚Äôre heading into World War 3,‚Äù Musk said. The two sides will likely continue arguing over exactly what information they‚Äôll need to hand over ‚Äî but thanks to today‚Äôs decision, we won‚Äôt be waiting long to see it.

* Musk said this months before formally attempting to back out of the $44 billion acquisition.
* A Twitter lawyer on Tuesday argued texts showed Musk was motivated by concern over his finances.

Elon Musk wanted to ""slow down"" his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter months after Russia invaded Ukraine, saying in private texts that it wouldn't make sense to buy Twitter ""if we're heading into World War 3.""

These texts came to light in a hearing Tuesday about pushing back a trial in October over Musk's deal to buy Twitter, along with other disputes about discovery. Musk told Twitter in July he was officially backing out of his agreement to buy the company in a letter that argued Twitter had wrongfully withheld data on ""bots"" and spam accounts.

The text messages were sent May 8 to a banker at Morgan Stanley, which is financing part of Musk's deal. In these texts, the billionaire also cited a coming speech from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin gave a speech May 9 for the 77th anniversary of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany, where he said Russia's decision to invade Ukraine in February was the ""only right decision"" and baselessly claimed the West was ""preparing for invasion of Russia.""

""Let's slow down just a few days,"" Twitter's lawyer said, reading out Musk's texts during the hearing. ""Putin's speech tomorrow is really important. It won't make sense to buy Twitter if we're heading into World War 3.""

Investors : ‚ÄúReally whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Me : ‚ÄúGuys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc‚Äù 

Investors : ‚ÄúWhat ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Me : ‚ÄúSo i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is  gonna cause unemployment to rise up to ""NAIRU"" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%.

Investors : ‚ÄúInteresting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Me : ‚ÄúJust so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that.  But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio.

Investors : ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre crazy. We are not confident with this investment‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Me : ‚ÄúI have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis‚Äù

Investors : ‚ÄúDo not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Me : ‚Äú Look guys. This is not crazy. It‚Äôs very logical‚Äù

Investors : ‚ÄúSo you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Me : ‚Äú You know what you‚Äôre absolutely f‚Äôin right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should‚Äôve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. 

Trader 1 : ‚ÄúYes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Me : ‚ÄúAre you f‚Äôin stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf‚Äôs to prevent theta decay. Did you ?

Trader 1 : \* Silent 

&amp;#x200B;

Me : ‚ÄúYah i guessed so.

\*\*After calming down

Me : ‚ÄúLook guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you‚Äôre gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data.

So I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn‚Äôt as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn‚Äôt lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future‚Äù In our case it's thousand more trading zones.

I hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. ‚Äú

&amp;#x200B;

Me -&gt; Traders who made profits.

Trader 2 : ‚Äúhaha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.‚Äù

Me : ‚ÄúYou guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Moral of the story is based on your interpretation. :)

Apologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So at last finally moving on...

**Respected Investors and Traders,**

&amp;#x200B;

[\\""Pain = Gain\\"" if you're bearish. XD](https://preview.redd.it/az0icb97nfm91.png?width=997&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a1388bb30c6ceafc10c5eab79d0abb668acba63)

&amp;#x200B;

How are you doing folks? I hope you guys enjoyed and partied this long weekend. If you didn‚Äôt well then if you found something interesting in your research then do share in the comments section. I read all of them. xD

God it has been quite a while hasn‚Äôt it. Some of you guys wanted the newsletter back because season 1 was quite a massive hit on Wall Street. So here I am back with season 2 weekly content.

I got many Dm‚Äôs that people made profits/ recovered losses with our trading strategies. I just wanna say guys ‚Äú Thank you. But in all honesty we were just lucky. So be careful from now on. Things are about to spiral out of control coz Sept + Q4 is apporaching‚Äù

Guys I am gonna try to live up to season 1 standards which i understand is already gonna be a huge challenge for me. 3 wins 1 draws 0 losses is not easy score to beat. But i will try.

Let‚Äôs see how it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street :**

 

https://preview.redd.it/nqebgpdgnfm91.jpg?width=852&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa1a68b5cbdc8e96daaf9e9dd318defa9b925566

&amp;#x200B;

Normally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street.

**1.** ***Johnny Wall Street***  


If you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex.

My friends and I just call him ""J Wall"" for short.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.** ***Lax Boy***  
This guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was ""vibing"" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss.

&amp;#x200B;

***3. The Bionic Woman***  
I wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks.

&amp;#x200B;

***4. The Guy without a GPS***  
He took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends.

&amp;#x200B;

***5. The Crusty Old Dude***  
Crusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted.

&amp;#x200B;

***6. Somebody's Sister***  
She doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake.

&amp;#x200B;

***7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy***  
He was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil?

&amp;#x200B;

***8. The Husband Hunter***  
This girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.)

&amp;#x200B;

***9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child***  
He made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word ""duration"" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him.

&amp;#x200B;

***10. Austin Powers***  
He's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits. He secretly rolls his eyes at Wall Street jargon and it's hard to catch. He won't mention he works on Wall Street until the third date - but that's why she falls for him.

&amp;#x200B;

***11. I'm Doing God's Work Man***  
He's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

***12.*** ***The Unusual Suspect***  
He's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station. But once the clock strikes 6 p.m., he'll limp out of the bar like Keyser Soze, then gradually pick up the pace to a full on sprint when he hits the sidewalk to catch the next train.

&amp;#x200B;

    Whatever i told you above is pure trash. As Gandhiji used to say, ""Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear"". Reason being this is what ""they"" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe.
    

&amp;#x200B;

**Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ?** 

 ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful ""Kevin O' Leary"" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift )

&amp;#x200B;

Well if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is very important to know who you‚Äôre trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** ***Retail / FI / Youtube &amp; Twitter guru‚Äôs trading strategy :*** 

&amp;#x200B;

[SPY](https://preview.redd.it/s751y2wtnfm91.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e93beace8ae97b4c73ba6128579ac74be57422ba)

[QQQ](https://preview.redd.it/zi07hbwtnfm91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=600ab012158cb037b129846265cc08757e07dedc)

Theory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife )

&amp;#x200B;

So currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f‚Äôed them bad ) and would say

SPY Buy : $369, 362, 339

QQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***2. HF‚Äôs and institutions trading strategy :*** 

&amp;#x200B;

[sp500Candles\(\) : This function is being followed right now](https://preview.redd.it/b87waz0gqfm91.png?width=1848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13a0ce9f71fa2e0d17b7e47205c2575c434c579e)

[nasdaqCompositeCandles \(\) : This can happen if sept 20-21 is crazy event.](https://preview.redd.it/ibezj21gqfm91.png?width=1822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c468ade732b413c9c00d446fb983550a94fe76c5)

&amp;#x200B;

So Hedge funds and Institutions know what the perfect levels are gonna be for bounces but that service is only available to premium members aka cheaters. Also they come on Cnbc and Bloomberg to confuse people and speak sh9t. Normal people who work in their office just code stuff or receive calls from clients to take trades. So here i will write a simple algo on a high level w/o getting involved in deep details

&amp;#x200B;

*USA stock market Algorithm ( For fun and entertainment purpose only )*

&amp;#x200B;

String Powell = ‚Äú ‚Äú;  // Current status : Himself

Int u = x; ( x = current cpi )

If ( Powell = ‚ÄúHimself‚Äù ){

copytrade(sp500Candles() );    // Two touch crash starts from November 2/3rd week  ( Most likely )

} 

else if ( Powell = ‚ÄúVolcker‚Äù ){

copytrade(nasdaqCompositeCandles () );    // One peak i.e. fast crash starts from Sept fomc. 

} 

else if ( Powell = ‚ÄúArthurBurns‚Äù){

if( u &lt; 8.6 ) 

{

NasdaqUp( );     // 1971-72 times ( Disinflation )

SpxUp( );

} 

else {

NasdaqDown( );   // 1970-71 times  ( Reinflation )

SpxDown( );

}

}

&amp;#x200B;

Note : Sorry to harm your feeling ""Algo traders"" Please don't take this seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**3.** ***Cheaters trading strategy : Let‚Äôs cheat ( ) = sp500candles(); / nasdaqCompositeCandles();***

&amp;#x200B;

[Higher TF analysis of sp500Candles\(\) on weekly time frame](https://preview.redd.it/qr5vbkvtnfm91.png?width=1825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9eee5c3c8671cbb3926bad05c062a651bda1d58b)

I don‚Äôt wanna call these people out but you guys already know who uses this trading strategy. I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters.

Apparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD

&amp;#x200B;

Buy zones :

Spx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week.

And just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :)

Sell zones :

Spx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week.

&amp;#x200B;

Note : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&amp;p500. That‚Äôs why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have.

&amp;#x200B;

***4. Illuminati trading strategy :*** 

( Fyi dont copy this technique. Just smile when it happens. Only few people know about the Gann Law of 7 but every f body uses Gann law of 3 )

&amp;#x200B;

So as you all know my  brother Itachi wrote ‚ÄúStock market is about to collapse in 47days‚Äù and predicted atleast a W bottom is coming. Max scenario levels he didn't mentioned coz he never tells the whole part of the story. But i will.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's study their last 7 big hits aka -18%+ crash just so everyone is one the same page.

&amp;#x200B;

\- 2015 : Chinese market plunged -30% in three weeks. ( I am not gonna show this Dyor )

&amp;#x200B;

[2008 vs 2001](https://preview.redd.it/58ilkne9rfm91.png?width=1817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7ed7be2c07a522f8398090707aac22695eb6bd8)

\- 2008 : Usa stock market collapsed in september.

\- 2001 : Usa stock market collapsed in september.

&amp;#x200B;

[1994](https://preview.redd.it/xe44p70drfm91.png?width=1812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=424f5656891a9386dfd0d0e6d9da314f38464191)

\- 1994 : Bond slaughterfest. ( We went -54% to complete this carnage full on )

&amp;#x200B;

[1987 vs 1980](https://preview.redd.it/ud1nv1aerfm91.png?width=1812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cdb115503e4776f1dd82e0e0944ea4ee39d160e)

\- 1987 : Black Monday crash 

\- 1980 : Volcker crash

&amp;#x200B;

[1973 vs 1966](https://preview.redd.it/u7ffr5afrfm91.png?width=1802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=008e1c315e7b8529e0a39d4de29159bcccb2c55d)

\- 1973 : Arthur got burned

\- 1966 : Vietnam/Korean war.

&amp;#x200B;

Note : The difference is always 7 and the accelerated crash happens over the span of 1 month. So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Note :** I have discounted the **""Noob level strategy""** by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result :**

*How to use this info ?* 

We attack first by our shorts. Also i am not giving you guys exact date because of the story above. Just range will do for now. But i will give you exact levels of top of Bear market rally 3 but first i need to see the bottom of this leg down. I hope you are understanding all of this and not getting even more confused than before.

&amp;#x200B;

[He played with \\""Black\\"" btw and attacked.](https://preview.redd.it/flbn1qb4ofm91.jpg?width=676&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=304f4d18f5590761bed31c8a9ac1cec0f9a5c395)

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** ***Strategy 1 :  Roy Lopez ( No risk, good reward )***

Well if i were you trynna play safe, I would just sell the rumor 75bps and buy it when we hit Fed Fomc  sept 20 but not necessarily long again. Then i will continue to wait for top of bear market rally. If it comes good then i short at top. If it doesn't well then i will still be happy to buy at such ridiculous discount and adding to my value stocks. I am not sharing what those are. Dyor and maybe this season i might share it and then we shall see if there are some common stocks we share.

&amp;#x200B;

Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx

Target : Fed Fomc sept 20.

and then short again november 2nd - 3rd week

&amp;#x200B;

***2. Strategy 2 : Evan's Gambit ( Medium risk, high reward )***

 ***I love this strategy***

&amp;#x200B;

Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx

Target : 200wMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita doesnt happen )

and then long in oct 1-2nd week till november 2-3rd week.

&amp;#x200B;

***3. Strategy 3 : King's Gambit/Fried Liver attack ( Maximum Risk, Max reward )***

&amp;#x200B;

Shorting zone : Anything above $3900 Spx

Target : 100mMA ( Should come by oct 2nd week if shmita happens )

not longing here until we get those f'ing numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

Note : Many people are speculating longing after Cpi 13th or Sept 20 Fomc but we are not doing that. Why? Because we don't copy others.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Risk of September 2022 :**

&amp;#x200B;

* Michael burry is calling every bears in town. No he doesn't call us but rather he tweets two times to show he is serious. Apple buy the rumor sell the news event ft. Perma Bears.

&amp;#x200B;

* Powell is coming to give a speech. Today it starts with Fed chair Brainard and then tomorrow we hear from Powell

&amp;#x200B;

* Then we CPI coming on 13th. So watch out for Bloomberg estimates coz they get priced into the markets.

&amp;#x200B;

* Then we have our September Key fomc due to economic projections. I am praying to god powell rugpull us and take Goldman and JP morgan traders to hell with them coz those guys will long after this event. And if the Illuminatis do show up will take trades opposite them since they need humungous liquidity to execute order 666.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ugw2bq8wafm91.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2f626e65cec1c59fcacf2ad3491363bfffbca5e

* September 25 : ""End of Elul"" so exp idk something on september 26 or september 23.

&amp;#x200B;

*  Final est of Gdp idk last week with Core PCE. Not a big event imo coz all the fireworks will happen before.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So guys again I am gonna warn you that ""Bank runs are coming by March 2023"". So be careful of not leaving your money in the bank. xD

&amp;#x200B;

Be humble ! Stay safe !  Eat healthy ! 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you

The report now starts with insider trading by sector and is followed by a high-level view. As is tradition here are the filtering criteria and additional context:

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Direct Open Market Transactions** (Transaction Code of ‚ÄúP‚Äù or ‚ÄùS‚Äù) for Form 4 filings with a Transaction Date from **August 29th - September 2nd.** This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line. General consensus is that these transactions have more predictive power than those for RSUs, stock options, warrants etc.
2. Weekly comps are compared to transactions from **August 22nd - August 26th**. So we are comparing the last full week of transactions to the prior full week of transactions.
3. **No penny stocks and banned tickers**. Flag stragglers (if any) and I will remove them.
4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income funds).

# Layout

1. There are two time horizons, **(1) Snapshot** and **(2) Trend Analysis**. The former aggregates all dates while the latter is broken out by Transaction Date.
2. The report is currently split into 6 sections**:**
   1. **Sector-Level Activity**
      1. Purchases and Sales
      2. Number of Insiders Buying/Selling
      3. C-Suite Transaction Value
      4. Transaction Counts
   2. **Dollar Value of Open Market Transactions (Snapshot/Trend)**
   3. **Open Market Transaction Counts (Snapshot/Trend)**
   4. **Top 10 Transactions by Category**
      1. Total Purchases (aggregated)
      2. Percent Increase in Shares Owned (individual transaction)
      3. CEO Purchases (aggregated)
      4. CFO Purchases (aggregated)
      5. 10% Owner Purchases (aggregated)
   5. **Company-Level Open Market Activity (Snapshot/Trend)**
   6. **Insider-Level Open Market Activity (Snapshot/Trend)**

# Further Context

1. The transaction count/spend for more recent Transaction Dates at times (varies by week) will appear to taper off. This is partly due to a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transaction data. The delay between Filing Date and Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. Banned tickers also impact the N-size though it should generally have a more distributed impact than backfilled transactions.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise transactions from this week are excluded.
3. 125 companies were flagged as banned due to either penny stock or sub 500M market cap. This puts a dent into the N-size though that is the price we pay for removing scams etc.
4. Data is sourced from[ Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

# Feedback/Questions

I will be adding more improvements to future posts. Open to all feedback. Feel free to add a comment or send a DM with suggestions/questions.

# Why is this worth looking at?

Fair point so let‚Äôs take a minute to review. So as with any dataset, when viewed in isolation this is not going to move the needle. **This is not a silver bullet.**

However I am of the opinion that an appreciation for what insiders (individual + in aggregate) are betting on (or not) is worth being aware of. At least a subset **\*should\*** have a 30,000 foot view of their company, competitors, their sector and the direction that it is headed. In the data lies clues.

**If you think GSAT &lt; $1.775 after announcement: GSAT 09/09 2P for $0.25 or less**

**If you think GSAT &gt; $1.775 after announcement: short GSAT 09/09 2P for $0.25 or more**

For the AAPL fanbois who have religiously followed the company, there was a rumor that another company--GT Advanced Technologies--would be contracted by Apple to produce Sapphire Glass Screens for the front of that generation's iphone.   


When the iPhone announcement came, there was no mention of Sapphire Glass, and GT Advanced Technologies crashed.   


There's a non-zero change that GSAT will suffer a similar fate.   


&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8giro2d1kfm91.png?width=1919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85d417828eea2daf4e63c1cfc73484612ded5c11

Looking at the option chain for GSAT, the 09/09 2P Vega is very small. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/epf9wct4kfm91.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61d1e0efeccce89100d5a56d2302e03af98fe876

Assuming the implied volatility falls back to the \~200% level, that represents a 140 point drop. Multiplied by the vega of 0.001, represents $0.14 / share of the 09/09 2P value. 

&amp;#x200B;

In order to overcome that $0.14 / share drop due to IV crush, the price of the stock would need to move about 0.36 to \~$1.77. 

Divide the price move attributed to IV crush by the delta.  


0.14 / -0.383 = -$0.365  


$2.14 - $0.365 = $1.775

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you think the price of GSAT will be below $1.775 after the announcement, you should buy 09/09 2P.   


If you think the price of GSAT will be above $1.775 after the announcement, you should sell the 09/09 2P."|0.78|25|0|25

FRANKFURT, Germany ‚Äî The European Central Bank is expected to frontload a series of rate hikes and sacrifice growth in the region due to the rising cost of living which is threatening to surge even higher. 

ECB Executive Board Member Isabel Schnabel‚Äôs speech in Jackson Hole set the tone for the upcoming policy meeting this week. With inflation in the euro zone projected to rise to at least 10% in the coming months and the risk of consumer prices rocketing higher, a ‚Äújumbo‚Äù rate hike of 75 basis points on Thursday is certainly a possibility.

‚ÄúAs frontloaded hikes can have a bigger impact on inflation expectations than a more gradual approach, a 75bp move could make sense,‚Äù said ECB watcher and Berenberg‚Äôs Chief Economist Holger Schmieding in a research note. 

‚ÄúAlthough it is largely priced in, it could still exacerbate strains in the bond markets.‚Äù

The recent halt of gas deliveries to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline has not only pushed stocks lower and increased the risk of a recession in Europe, it‚Äôs also pushed Italian government 10-year yields to 4% ‚Äî the highest level since mid-June before the ECB announced the creation of an anti-fragmentation tool. High yields for Italy ‚Äî much higher than those in Germany ‚Äî mean the government in Rome has to pay more to borrow, exacerbating concerns over its hefty debt pile.

Inflation in the euro zone hit 9.7% in August and with the continued pressure on energy prices it‚Äôs expected to reach double-digit levels in the coming months. At the same time the risk of a recession is looming large over the region‚Äôs economy as consumers feel the pain and scale back their consumption, and companies struggle with high energy prices.

‚ÄúWhile governments will partially ‚Äòfoot the bill‚Äô, there are limits to what extent the private sector can be shielded from this income shock,‚Äù said Dirk Schumacher with Natixis in a research note to clients. 

‚ÄúThe drop in consumer confidence to a record low over the last months, indicates that households are aware of these limits with respect to government support. There is also increasing evidence that companies in energy intensive sectors are reducing production.‚Äù
Quantitative tightening

Because of the inflation outlook, the ECB is expected to sacrifice growth in order to keep inflation expectations anchored, as this is the bank‚Äôs core mandate.

‚ÄúA key take away from recent comments by ECB officials is that the hiking cycle will be less sensitive to recession than we thought,‚Äù said Deutsche Bank‚Äôs Chief Economist Mark Wall in a research note.

‚ÄúWe raised our terminal rate forecast by 50bp to 2.5%,‚Äù he added. The ECB‚Äôs benchmark rate is currently at zero.

The Frankfurt institution believes its ‚Äúneutral‚Äù rate ‚Äî an optimal level for a steady economy ‚Äî to be between 1% and 2% and with inflation risk rising the ECB‚Äôs Governing Council might need to consider raising rates above that level into tightening territory. 

That, of course, also raises the question about quantitative tightening ‚Äî which is the technical description for shrinking the central bank‚Äôs balance sheet. Selling assets has not yet been discussed by the ECB. 

‚ÄúGiven the threat to the ECB‚Äôs credibility, we also wonder why quantitative tightening is not discussed,‚Äù Anatoli Annenkov of Societe Generale, said in a research note. ‚ÄúNot using QT should imply higher rates.‚Äù"|0.89|56|0|56

t3_x7vzkg|1662526234|wallstreetbets|BBBY is not a GME scenario, not even close. If you think it is, you're in trouble.|"I know y'all are looking for the next big thing after striking gold with GME. I was right there alongside y'all as it made its historic climb, and I sold when I was satisfied with my profits. If that makes me a paperhanded sellout, I don't care. I made money, end of story. If y'all think that is somehow a bad thing, then y'all are delusional. The ultimate goal of every trade you make should be to make money, not to stick it to your idea of the 'bad guys.' With that out of the way, just because WSB was involved with the biggest short squeeze since Volkswagen doesn't mean that somehow **any** ticker that people decide to pile on here will be a success. There are a number of differences between GME and BBBY that should make anyone with half a smooth brain think twice.  

1. **GME was not facing bankruptcy risk.**   
Just because everyone thought GME's business model was defunct (before y'all piled on) doesn't mean it actually was. They had decent liquidity, they were able to lease-back their warehouses, and they still had the new console cycle to potentially rev up sales again. They also had working capital that was larger than their debt by a long-shot. Despite this, GME was shorted like crazy and at many points, the short interest exceeded 100%. That was why I got into the shares in 2020, and why I would afford to wait as long as it took until the short squeeze happened. They could remain in business longer than the shorts could stay solvent. Ryan Cohen was simply the spark that ignited the fire.   
BBBY, on the other hand, has an exceedingly large debt pile and little way of paying it off organically. The fact that they decide to sell shares recently close to the bottom shows this. That means that even if BBBY does last a few more years, it'll come at the expense of shareholders. They're literally paperhanding while y'all are stuck with the bags. How did they get in this situation, with so much debt? That leads me to my next point. 
2. **GME was excellent at buybacks, whereas BBBY has been horrible at it.**   
GME bought back a large % of the float, at least 30%, with its buybacks over the late 2010's. They had a large windfall after selling the Mobile phone division, and pretty much used all of it to buyback shares when they were in the $5 range (pre-split), which would be under $2 now. This definitely played a part in trapping the shorts, tipping the short interest over 100% eventually. It was only after the squeeze took off that GME sold shares in the $200 range, further securing capital so that they had the ability to pivot and find other growth venues (Whether they have succeeded here is another story). But the point being, they were able to secure enough runway to anchor the stock to a higher price point, which is why GME is doing decently well even to this day.   
BBBY, however, decided to squander all their capital in the 2010's on buybacks when the stock price in the $40 and $50 range! The worst part was they took on debt to do this, essentially gambling away the future of the company on the hopes that BBBY sales would never falter.  BBBY was worth over 9 Billion dollars, and they took over 1.5 billion in debt in 2015 to buyback a   
mere fraction of the shares. And now the business is worth barely third they spent that year on buybacks. This is all fine if the business itself was fine, which brings me to my last point.   

3.  **BBBY's business has no moat or niche, other than heavy discounting with coupons.**   
GME, while it is far from its prime, still has a niche. No one is going to get into video game re-selling or physical devices. They did try to pivot to merchandise like POPs and collectibles, which helped a bit as well. They still faced heavy competition from a bunch of stores, but at least they had a specialty. What is BBBY's specialty? Beds? Baths? The Beyond in their name even shows they sell too many random things. Why would someone go to BBBY when they could go to Target or Walmart or Costco? GME has the benefit of selection and variety, but BBBY has very few things people need to go there for. And when they do go there, they usually only do so to use the 20% coupons, which destroys margins. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Anyway**, I know this is WSB, not some fundamental analysis board. But since everyone who's diamond handing is essentially a buy-and-hold investor (whether you like it or not), remember, if the business goes under, it will be a loss whether you sell or not. If y'all are willing to hold on forever, then it's not even a trade, since a trade needs to have an exit point, and I just can't see what could happen outside of a miracle that could give y'all that. (especially if you decided to buy at the peak over $25 a few weeks ago) I'm all up for outsized bets, but my god, it's more fun if it's not just diving straight off a cliff. At least aim for something that has a **chance** of striking big. Just because something is heavily shorted doesn't mean it's bound to fly. And if there is something I'm missing, then I'd love to hear it. Best of luck y'all.   


TLDR: BBBY sucks a lot more than GME and management will probably paperhand shares faster than y'all can stay solvent."|0.42|0|0|0

t3_x7utg7|1662522562|wallstreetbets|Why I believe DOCU will tank following earnings this week all the way into 2023|"Elevator pitch:

DOCU is one of the Covid stocks that has already fallen alot (75% YTD) but it still sports a P/S of 5 on a negative GAAP operating margin and EPS. This segment has very low barrier of entry and cost of changing to a competitor. There are very strong (potential) competitors that can leverage huge platform effects (MSFT, AAPL, ADBE etc.). Currently DOCU has very attractive gross margins which likely will be eroded by competition. If they cannot be GAAP positive now, it will only get worse.

Growth is slowing substantially, so far the CAGR and YoY growth numbers look quite but soon will deteriorate based on recent quarters. If the growth trajectory has slowed further in Q2 which is likely, the stock will drop.

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth:**

Top line growth has almost halted over the last months, down to only $8m in Q1 FY23. Moreover, Billings which take into account contract liabilities have declined in Q3 FY22 and Q1 FY23 already.

[The bar chart on the right is not to scale. Source: Docusign investor relation presentation](https://preview.redd.it/1mav8mi0ucm91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f26c83d624e98262ceaa35bc555ea41ec200c1a)

Customer Growth has decelerated substantially, only growing 6% in Q1

&amp;#x200B;

**Profitability**

DOCU sports very high non-GAAP Gross Margins of &gt;80%. While this is an impressive number, it is not surprising as it sells a pure non-customized SAAS solution. Currently DOCU benefits from a very advantageous marketing approach where it charges customers on a per-signature model. A key risk is that competitors may offer a flatrate model which would offer six or seven figure savings to large MNC customers.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7jwsgj1ovcm91.png?width=1465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dda1929caa241f2a79346796de2978f29522769

However the core issue is stock based compensation and other cost that Management excludes in Non-GAAP results. overall, this results in negative GAAP operating margins

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dj6up53jwcm91.png?width=1447&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=589881588f3a06a91b28126b850b1c6d574ad74e

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion DOCU currently is investing heavily in growth on a steeply diminishing returns basis. It seems that customer acquisition cost are increasing rapidly and Sales is consuming most of the FCF generated by the business

&amp;#x200B;

**Stock based compensation (SBC)**

in 2021 DOCU paid its employees ca. 245m SBC while this has increased to 350m in FY 2022. In Q1 FY23, SBC has increased to 95m which results in a minimum of 380m if Headcount &amp; compensation stays flat. However, HC has increased 25% over FY 22 so it can be expected that growth will continue and thus SBC.

SBC is a helpful tool to manage cash burn for a growth company with expanding market capitalization and rising stock price. However, on declining market cap it poses additional dilutive downward pressure on stock price.

Example:

At the current market cap of ca. 10bn, an annualized SBC of 500m will represent a dilution of 5%. The same SBC would have only meant a 1% dilution one year ago when the market cap was circa 50bn. Should the stock decline further towards 5bn, SBC will dilute by 10%.

**Summary:**

While DOCU is as fundamentally profitable (non-GAAP) venture without debt and a robust balance sheet. Currently it is the leader in this field, however the hurdles of entry are low and competitors like MSFT could offer the product as part of their existing platform (MS Office) which would make DOCU obsolete for many customers.

Further, it seems the current pricing model where customers pay per signature seems very advantageous for DOCU as the marginal cost of each signature tends to be zero. However, it can be expected that competitors will offer flatrate models (as is customary with more mature SAAS solutions) which will put high margin pressure on DOCU.

Therefor I rate this a sell. I will open a short position today as I expect this stock to trend towards a 5bn valuation which would put it at a 10 FY22 FCF multiple.

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks**:

The company is not fundamentally flawed and could convert into a profitable business if Sales and SBC cost are managed.

The company is still relatively small with 2bn revenue and may be able to recover its growth trajectory.

If growth stocks experience another rally, DOCU will certainly be one of the potential winners."|0.79|15|0|15

(not post ordering)

---

This weekend I changed the default sort on threads from ""best"" to ""new"". 

The reasoning was that it would be nice to give people who were late to the discussion a chance to have their voices heard and a chance for readers to see the latest user thinks, not what the hivemind thinks. (Downvoted comments should still get automatically collapsed)

There's been some negative feedback on this so I wanted to gather more of your thoughts in a dedicated thread.

Your feedback is really helpful and will help shape the subreddit so please take the time to share your feedback below and vote in the poll. 

While your votes in the poll are important, your comments are much more impactful. 

A few things of note:

* We could have different sorts for different for flair types

* We could have different sorts at different points in a thread's lifecycle (post age, # of votes, # of comments, some combination thereof)

* We could change it up by day of the week or poster attributes (age, frequency of posting, etc.)

If you‚Äôre like me and in your early 20s, this is terrible advice. Our parents and grandparents had the ability to invest in the quickest growth in human history. Think about that. Just because the last 50 years have been insane growth doesn‚Äôt mean the future will be. The economy will either be stagnant or lower in the future. 

If you follow Elon Musk, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen his take on [underpopulation](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1563020169160851456?s=46&amp;t=UWWtwmwjDeA2twRazq5H3Q)

Here‚Äôs a excellent video where he talks about [it too](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRPQnBLa/)



You may be thinking ‚ÄúHE JUST WANTS MORE WORKERS! HE IS A RICH BILLIONAIRE DONT LISTEN TO ELON‚Äù

Why wouldn‚Äôt you listen to Elon, or at least be curious to see if he‚Äôs right? Well let‚Äôs take a look. 

Long term, the [fertility rate](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/fertility-rate) has been steadily going down. So has the [marriage rate](https://www.statista.com/statistics/195951/marriage-rate-in-the-united-states-since-1990/).

Now let‚Äôs take a look at population by generation. [Almost 90 million old people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/797321/us-population-by-generation/). 

The last statistic I want to bring up is that 30% of men ages 18-30 are not having sex. [Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/29/share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high/)

This means less and less younger people are getting married and having kids. Young men 18-30 who are not having sex won‚Äôt suddenly get married and start having kids. This will translate into a worse economy in the next 20-40 years. When the millennials and gen Z are older, we will literally not have enough young workers to keep the economy going. My prediction is the next great crash in the mid 21st century will be due to an underpopulated society. 

These are all indicators of a slowing society. It‚Äôs not good for your long term portfolio. A healthy society would be raising children and keeping the family unit alive. 

The only counter argument people have is that immigration will solve this. Sadly you couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. We get maybe 1 million [people a year](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/20/key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants/) immigrating to the USA. 

Less people means less innovation, less growth, and a slower economy. It‚Äôs going to be a rapid decline. I don‚Äôt want to say 2021 will be the peak of the market forever, but we‚Äôll see.

Wall Street bettors who win will be the richest. Short term/medium traders will be the winners in the long term.

South Korea is already [paying people triple to have kids](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-31/korea-to-triple-baby-payments-in-bid-to-tackle-fertility-crisis). Capitalism doesn‚Äôt thrive without a young population."|0.36|0|0|0

* SPY closed down 0.38%
* QQQ closed down 0.72%
* Dow Jones Industrial closed down 0.55%
* VIX closed up 3.54%

Good evening everyone, hope you all had a nice start to the week. Markets opened up slightly but then quickly sold off and traded sideways for the rest of the day. This was a somewhat neutral day as the markets did close lower but were able to rally off of the lows of the day. We may see another day of sideways action as Jerome Powell is set to speak Thursday morning. Additionally on Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) will be announcing an interest rate hike of potentially 50 to 75 basis points. With these announcements coming up soon we may see the market take a breath before choosing a direction based on the central banks comments.

https://preview.redd.it/afbxp46wacm91.png?width=2246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aaccb18decab4b4022a3843ff8aa9c433064414

SPY fell below last weeks lows but was able to rally in the afternoon and close right on the support trendline. This was still a decent close because we saw that there were buyers present as SPY fell. Still we have a crossover of the 8 and 50 day EMA which can be indicative of a reversal in trend. We would need to see real power and a strong push with heavy volume above todays highs to consider a long position.

https://preview.redd.it/5u7a66uwacm91.png?width=2274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76b70392ee559c59097383c8321e5951cb905253

QQQ is much weaker, we closed right at last weeks lows but we did see some volume support come in. Technically speaking, I do not see much of a reason to open a long position in QQQ if todays highs are taken out. There is no support line or EMA to bounce off of and it would quickly run into the previous trenlind line. You could make the argument that the June/July tops could act as support but that isn‚Äôt enough for me to consider a position.

Recap on recent positions:

I am currently not in any positions but there are several stocks I am watching closely if the market begins to turn.

Potential Setups:

https://preview.redd.it/bu2e5tmxacm91.png?width=2249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59acaa14980b839bb525ca2c2b47449c95b4b44d

Since QQQ is looking like the weaker index I am watching \*\*TICKER SYMBOL ON CHART (WSB DOES NOT LIKE FOR SOME REASON)\*\* which is a 2x inverse ETF. If we see this taking out $23.70 that could be a potential entry point.

https://preview.redd.it/0wpoz4eyacm91.png?width=2254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4246cb7be0d732b136e6692667a64929a89fb60

Canadian Solar (CSIQ) has a pennant forming and has a potential entry of $46.20 which coincides to taking out Fridays highs. You can see the large increase in Sales and EPS on the chart as well as the days or short interest. If this begins to move higher the shorts could be forced to cover and potentially push the price up as well. However, one thing I do not like is the number of tailbars near the highs. This is showing me it has the potential to run up and down really quickly.

https://preview.redd.it/h63tjx6zacm91.png?width=2268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ba4dfc42c0708f77b9e4e9925fadfcd4c3c5bc8

DCP Midstream (DCP) is approaching a long base breakout. It is approaching this base on heavy volume and also has 7.2 days of short interest. If we push above this base that would be the highest price this stock has seen in the last 4 years. The short would have to start covering and could push the price higher by doing so.

https://preview.redd.it/7r2fm910bcm91.png?width=2261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb2162faae21bb85cdaa5c7a14c43f5673692dec

HF Sinclair Corporation (DINO) has a buy price of $54.70 and is a bounce setup. We are looking at a bounce off of the 8 day EMA while also taking out todays high.

https://preview.redd.it/oiv62j11bcm91.png?width=2274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19524e9a9c406fe4c0a4c971c0153e1142366ee9

Lastly, Evolent Health (EVH) has a downward sloping trendline and a buy point of $37.70 taking out todays highs. EVH has 8.3 days of short interest! You know what that means!

Even with the indices not having the best day today there are still several stocks that are setting up nicely. This shows the importance of scanning the charts everyday because you never know when the markets will turn and opportunity will present itself.

Bringing everything together:

The market is not in the best of shape but atleast we are not back at the lows for the entire move! There are still several stocks with nice setups that could trigger if we see overall sentiment turn. With news from central banks coming out soon we may pause at where we are out until Thursday morning. That could give individual names that chance to form a longer base and have a nice breakout when the market turns. If we do go lower we also have the inverse ETFs that will enable us to capitalize on that move. Overall, continue to work the charts and keep your eye open for the right opportunities."|0.78|14|0|14

t3_x7oc8l|1662504579|wallstreetbets|The energy sector is facing a potential 2008 style collapse|"ill try to break this down in an easy way:

1) Multiple EU energy suppliers run power plants and produce electricity. 

2) The amount of electricity produced each year in the future is known because the volume of energy that the system can generate is fairly constant. What is not known is the future price of electricity, it can be higher or lower depending on multiple factors.

3) Future uncertainty in the price poses a significant risk to the companies cause its impossible to tell the future revenue. To counter for this problem, electricity contracts are sold for future dates but with a fixed price. this means that electricity will be sold at todays price in 2025 (for example), independently of the market price in 2025. This is called a forward contract.

4) This is a good example taken from an article in the AXPO magazine: A seller and buyer conclude a contract for electricity delivery in 2025 at EUR 80/MWh. If the electricity price increases to EUR 110/MWh by 2025, this also changes the value of the transaction for the two parties. For the buyer, the contract is worth EUR 30/MWh more. For the seller, it is the opposite ‚Äì the contract is worth EUR 30/MWh less. So, if the seller cannot deliver on the agreed date (because they have gone bankrupt in the meantime, for instance), the buyer loses EUR 30 on each MWh because it has to buy electricity from another supplier at short notice, at the higher price of EUR 110. A potential default of the seller results into ‚Äòcredit exposure‚Äô for the buyer amounting to EUR 30 per MWh, which totals EUR 262,800 (8,760 x EUR 30). The same applies in reverse for the seller if the price per MWh drops to EUR 50 at the time of delivery. If the buyer is unable to accept and pay for the electricity at the time of delivery, the seller has to sell this energy to another buyer at a lower price. 

4) Based on this, in order to minimize risk, its a good practice to exchange collateral between both parties until the maturity of the contract. seller and buyer will then regularly check how the price of electricity is moving and based on this they will deposit or get back collateral.

5) Electricity prices are sharply rising because of recent events (war, pandemic, electricity consumption, etc) which means electricity companies need to put more collateral every day, loosing millions in their hedge and draining their cash reserves

6) This is triggering a liquidity crisis and if the price continues to rise it might lead to the collapse of multiple companies."|0.63|7|0|7

Even though they extended the vote to Thursday they  are probably still not going to get the votes needed. The only option  they had was to fork over $2.8 million to extend it 3 months or \~$6  million to extend to 6 months. At 3:50 PM they announced they were  extending it to 3 months (for now).

*""If  the Extension Amendment is not approved by the stockholders by   September 8, 2022, ARC Global Investments II, LLC, the Company's sponsor   (the ""Sponsor""), intends to contribute to the Company's trust account   an aggregate amount of $2,875,000, which is equal to $0.10 per share of   Class A common stock issued in the Company's initial public offering,  to  extend the time to consummate an initial business combination for a   three-month period, until December 8, 2022.""*

As  I announced on the thread I sold my puts at 11 AM with the increased IV  for $85k profit and would monitor the news to go back into puts or  calls depending what they decided to do. With this news, the stock is NOT going to $10.20 on Friday no matter what happens. As today was  mostly people shorting the stock rather than the die-hard Trumpers  selling I am expecting a big short covering tomorrow.  Also it's kind of bullish they are paying $3 million they can't get back to extend....maybe they think the merger will happen. Nothing crazy tomorrow but maybe a 10%+ rally. Maybe even 20% if people wanna get crazy but I'm waiting for 10% to sell.

I mentioned on Friday that I didn‚Äôt suspect we would open and just straight drill and we were until the last seconds before open holding fairly green as I suspected. However, the bears once again took control today. 

https://preview.redd.it/9lnd67mqwam91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0326a22e9e8cba3398838df587977958f1f5bb55

Today we finally saw the 13 week long recovery support line from the June low/ v-bottom break on SPY. This is the same trend line we saw break last Friday on Apple. 

With this trend line broken AND bears finally closing a candle below 391 support and also breaking down to 388.42 intraday today I am officially bearish. I am also bearish due to CPI and FOMC that are coming up soon. Lets talk chart technical and then end of this I will tell you why I am bearish fomc/ cpi and what position I am in because of it. 

SPY daily has a nice falling wedge forming right now (black solid lines) this falling wedge gives us a support tomorrow at 387.8 and a resistance of 394.1 (todays HOD). There are fairly high odds that we will see this falling wedges support broken later this week. 

Key resistance now will remain at 391 tomorrow as that is the major daily resistance level that we have to watch and that took 3 trading days to finally close below. 

We are still trading within that red bear channel which gives support tomorrow at 382 (-2.2% from close) and gives resistance of 401.1 (+2.6%). Until we see the red bear channel resistance line broken I would hesitate to go long here on calls especially since we broke into the 380s today. 

&amp;#x200B;

Spy weekly we did perfectly hold support on that 13 week long weekly bull support line, however, in later you see that Apple and Futures both broke this support so SPY should be to follow next. I mentioned that we should play level to level on SPY now. With the 390 level being breached and the 380s being seen for the first time since middle of July we now are set up in the current trajectory to see 360s-370s by end of September. 

Key support is now 390.3 on the weekly chart from there the next major support is 367.1 which is the weekly 200ema. The weekly 200ema is where we bounce aggressively off in June. 

Key resistance will be at 396.5 for this week followed by 402.2.

Similar story as you may expect with futures. We broke under 3900 today for the first time since July 19th. However, as of now the bears were unable to close under key support of 3900. We did see a break down of the 13 week long v-bottom bull support line today also. This should lead to a bearish movement going forward. 

Key supports to watch is 3900 -&gt; 3883 (the black solid falling wedge) -&gt; 3865 -&gt; 3816.

Key resistance to watch is 3925 -&gt; 3944 (black falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 4025.

Here is that weekly futures support line breakdown I was speaking about above. With this line being broken that is incredibly bearish longer term. With this support line being broken this gives rise to test support at 3827 and 3676 (weekly 200ema). I will be watching for futures to finally close under 3900 this week and that will be the longer term signal that 3600s are coming again. 

Key resistance remains at 4000 this week. Until this week breaks 4000 I will remain bearish.

Apple actually had a fairly bearish day today now only short term but long term. With a close below the daily 200ema for the first time since July this should be a very bearish omen for the future.

Key support remains at 153.2 (falling wedge black solid lines) and then 150 (-3%) for the red bear channel support. 

Key resistance is 156 (black falling wedge resistance line) and then 160.3 (+3.6%) for the red bear channel resistance.

The Apple charts weekly is actually kinda crazy to look at. When you think about the fact that Apple really has survived the best of all the stocks out there (for the most part) its natural that it has the most downside to expect too. The weekly is in a clear downward cycle that looks just like March. With this current downward channel I can expect a possibility that Apple COULD reach 120s by October on the current trajectory. 

With the weekly 13 week long bull support line being broken I fully anticipate further downside on Apple the rest of the week and month. 

Key levels

150.3 -&gt; 145.7 -&gt; 141.9 (weekly 100ema)

The VIX continues to find support and continues to make new highs. Today we actually made a new recent high again. We backtested the 8ema support and also 25.5 support and held that. We also managed to close over key 26.8 resistance from last week. The VIX appears to be on a trajectory for 30+ which makes a lot of sense when you factor in CPI next Tuesday the 13th and FOMC in 15 days on the 21st. 

Speaking of CPI and FOMC‚Ä¶ let me tell you how I am positioned and how I am playing this. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zcjyz82wwam91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b77648d58ea96c5c1af5bc0885afb1382e7c0588

I alerted this today and here is why. This is the week before CPI and historically (you guys know I love my historic trends) there is usually a 2 days sell off prior to CPI. In the past 5 CPIs we are actually averaging a total drop of about 2.5% over the two days leading up to CPI. In addition the week before CPI (which is also next week) is averaging a intraweek drop of -2.86% through the week with two of those having a 5%+ drop. If you don‚Äôt factor in the last FOMC (the only time we were green the week before FOMC) then we are actually averaging a -4.23% drop the week prior to FOMC. 

With this info you can see how it‚Äôs a pretty good odds that we are going to see a sell off EOW here and next week should be red due to the historical trend. Now here is something even more suspicious about this CPI‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/grz1ir8xwam91.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5bfbfd1fe43a7d4f33266440c9b58839ce298d1

Historically the CPI forecast and consensus is released well ahead of the actual CPI reading. The last CPI I know they released CPI about 2-3 week before the physical CPI reading happened. I know in the last there were times it was released just shortly after the previous CPI also. The fact that there is no release of this CPI, the president says inflation hasn‚Äôt peaked, technically month over month CPI was 0% so it too didn‚Äôt drop just didn‚Äôt go up, all the fed members screaming inflations not peaked, and daddy JPOW himself at the Jackson hole saying inflation hasn‚Äôt peaked and rate hikes haven‚Äôt stopped‚Ä¶ I have a feeling this consensus/ forecast has purposefully not been released yet. I think when they release it the number is going to be way higher then the previous 8.5% and when that happens markets are going to panic and we are going to see a very similar June 8th to June 13th CPI drop of 10% in 5 days. 

I personally believe we are seeing the bear storm forming and the eye of the hurricane is here right now.

I opened this put today. I will hold this put until we break the red resistance of this bear market. If we test and reject the red resistance line I will average this put down. Otherwise I will let this one ride. 

I tactfully chose September 21st expiration as that is the FOMC meeting and my goal would be to close this either the Friday before FOMC or the day before FOMC depending on how markets have behaved and reacted to CPI. Another potential take profits are will be 370 as that will be a major support line too. 

10% challenge-

After last weeks frustration I decided to go down to about a $1000/ position with a -20% stop loss and a 20% take profit set on all orders. I also watch the stochs and whenever I see the stochs hit overbought (if im in call) or over sold (if in puts) on the 1min when im scalping I exit no matter where I am profit wise. 

Today was a much needed day for me mentally. The biggest change I made today though besides a slightly smaller position size was that I no longer hesitated in a play. I often found myself waiting and waiting and waiting for all the confirmations only to find I missed the bigger move. Today when I saw the setup and the trend aligned with my strategy I didn‚Äôt let fear stop me from entering. If it met my criteria I entered and it worked really well for me today. I truly look forward to the rest of the week trading now.

## DWAC

[Love it](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-06/trump-tied-spac-sinks-on-concerns-about-completion-of-deal?srnd=premium&amp;sref=1kJVNqnU):

&gt;Investors dumped shares of¬†Digital World Acquisition Corp., the blank-check firm set to merge with Donald Trump‚Äôs social media company, after executives deferred a shareholder vote that was meant to get an extension to complete the deal -- signaling uncertainty surrounding the sponsors‚Äô ability to get enough support.  
Executives at the special purpose acquisition company adjourned the meeting to extend the deadline by up to a year until Thursday in an attempt to court retail shareholders to vote, a group that historically misses out on such events. The SPAC needs 65% of shareholders to support the extension.  
Digital World‚Äôs shares fell as much as 21% to $19.70 on Tuesday, the lowest since the deal was announced in October, while warrants tied to the firm sank 27%. Its shares had plunged earlier Tuesday after Reuters reported that sponsors don‚Äôt expect to get enough holder support for a one-year extension to complete a deal with Trump Media &amp; Technology Group.  
Trading volume for both the stock and warrants were more than ten-times higher than normal as of 12:11 p.m. in New York. More than 3 million shares changed hands as roughly 613,000 warrants were flipped.

We [talked about](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-09-01/the-trump-spac-needs-more-time?sref=1kJVNqnU) this situation last Thursday. DWAC is scheduled to expire on Sept. 8: If it does not get an extension, then it turns into a pumpkin this Thursday. Then DWAC‚Äôs public shareholders get paid out about $10.20 per share in cash,¬†a 2% return on the $10 they paid for their shares last September. DWAC‚Äôs stock closed on Friday at $24.99. It got as high as $175 last October, after announcing its merger with TMTG. If you own DWAC stock, you think that the prospect¬†of a merger with Trump‚Äôs company is worth much, much more than $10.20 per share. You should vote for an extension, to try to make that merger happen. It is irrational not to. And yet!¬†

Here (from DWAC‚Äôs [Securities and Exchange Commission filings](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000119312522236984/d398183ddefa14a.htm))¬†is a Rumble interview in which a musician and worship leader named Chad Nedohin interviewed¬†DWAC Chief Executive Officer Patrick Orlando¬†last week:

&gt;**Orlando:**¬†Obviously this is an important vote for us. We, we are voting on extending the amount of time that we have to complete this proposed business combination. Currently we were one years back. We‚Äôve had some delays. This is a, a deal with a lot of attention on it. It‚Äôs slower than expected, but we‚Äôre fighting every single day, working every single day to advance the ball. And this is where we need the stockholders to come in and have their votes counted. Typically in proxy votes, the participation of retail shareholders is relatively low. I believe it‚Äôs somewhere in the, the 28% range is once the district that I read, you know, we‚Äôre looking for far greater participation. ‚Ä¶  
So, you know, this is important. It‚Äôs, it‚Äôs engagement, and exercising your rights is something we really, really stand behind, personally, and you know, I think your actions, your words, and, your thoughts have to be consistent, and if you feel strongly enough to buy the stock, then, you know, you should be exercising your right to vote.  
**Nedohin:**¬†And we do feel strongly. This is, uh, this is the DWAC family. We consider ourselves the diamond hands of all diamond hands. This is the team that, that‚Äôs gonna go. So, you know what guys go, DWAC fam. Get those votes in. Uh‚Ä¶  
**Orlando:** Yeah, I mean, if you know anybody holding DWAC, that, that isn‚Äôt aware of the vote, it‚Äôd be really, really important to, to get them aware of the vote. ‚Ä¶  
**Nedohin:**¬†Yeah.¬†And so actually, I‚Äôm gonna issue a challenge here. Um, to all of the DWAC holders out there, to the DWAC fam, we need 65%,¬†right Patrick?  
**Orlando:** Correct.  
**Nedohin:** I‚Äôm gonna say, guys, let‚Äôs go for 90. Let‚Äôs show the Deep State and the Dems and everybody else out there, all the hedge funds, everybody‚Äôs gone after this stock. Let‚Äôs show them that this is a group of retail investors that is engaged and here for the win. Let‚Äôs get the 90%. It is your right to vote, and let‚Äôs show them that we are going to take that right. Let‚Äôs show them what voter turnout looks like.

Look. I am not going to sit here and tell you that it‚Äôs rational to pay $24.99 for a share of DWAC stock. I am not at all sure that this merger will happen if they get the one-year extension, and if the merger does happen I am not at all sure that Trump Media &amp; Technology Group will ever make any money for shareholders. But¬†given that DWAC shareholders apparently think the merger is worth $24.99, it is definitely irrational for them not to vote for the extension. You are definitely better off selling the stock for $24.99, or $20, or whatever, than you are getting back $10.20 this week. If you are buying DWAC stock today for $20 and then not voting, you are pretty much throwing away $10. What a weird move.

Now, there is another option. Reuters [notes](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/exclusive-deal-partner-trumps-truth-social-fails-get-backing-spac-extension-2022-09-06/):

&gt;Were Digital World to fail in its bid to get its shareholders to back the one-year extension, its management has the right to extend its life without shareholder approval by up to six months. It is unclear whether Digital World will pursue this option and if it would provide enough time for regulators to reach a conclusion on whether to allow the deal to proceed.

There is a fun little dynamic here, because DWAC‚Äôs managers *can*¬†extend the deadline for six months without shareholder approval, but they have to pay for it with their own money. DWAC‚Äôs sponsors put up about $11.3 million of startup costs to get DWAC running. If the deal closes, this will work out very well for them: At Friday‚Äôs closing price, their stake in DWAC would be worth about $165 million. [1](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-09-06/trump-spac-doesn-t-have-the-votes#footnote-1) If the deal does not close, they‚Äôll lose their $11 million.

If they don‚Äôt get enough shareholder votes to extend the deadline on Thursday, then they will have two choices:

1. Return money to shareholders and eat the $11 million loss, or
2. Pay another $2,875,000 for a three-month extension until December, with the possibility of paying another $2,875,000 in December for another three-month extension until March 2023.

If they pay for the extension(s), then they can either close the merger in the next three (or six) months, or they can try again to get enough shareholder votes for a longer extension. But then they‚Äôve got more money committed: Instead of the $11 million they put up originally, they‚Äôll have $14 million or $17 million committed to this thing. If the merger closes, they get that money back or can convert it into shares, which makes this an even better deal for them. But if the merger does not close, that money goes to the public shareholders; the sponsors don‚Äôt get it back.

Obviously if they close the merger and get $165 million worth of stock then the extra $3 million they have to put in now is pocket change. You‚Äôre betting $3 million to win $165 million, come on. On the other hand if they think that the odds of closing the deal are really really really really really low, then that‚Äôs throwing good money after bad.

What do¬†*you*¬†think the odds are of this deal closing? Are they better than 1 in 50? What do you think DWAC‚Äôs sponsors think the odds are? When DWAC initially went public it said that it would give notice of any paid-for extension at least three days before its deadline, and it‚Äôs now two days before the deadline and there‚Äôs been no notice.

And the thing they are all talking about right now is the Chinese IPOs and IPOs in general.  Which makes sense because while the majority of this sub is giving back all their GME gains to the hedge funds via BBBY transfers, rich fucks are raking in money on IPO pumps.  Your boy RC pumped his BBBY bags and rugged everyone so why shouldn't you enjoy that same level of pleasure?!?  Probably because you're too stupid and not a billionaire.  But just incase you have a couple wrinkles in your brain and more than 2 pennies to rub together let me to continue introducing you to the wonderful world of IPOs.  I'm sure there is another sub this belongs on but this one is way more fun and I honestly like the majority of the folks I've met on here.  

Let me make this real simple.  See this horse?  Scroll down.  

https://preview.redd.it/ctn2d0j0iam91.jpg?width=1276&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dcd1a4e2b297b7df2b41c65366eea9eeaabd8cf

See this horse? 

https://preview.redd.it/inwjvnl3iam91.jpg?width=524&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=969a171cdfd0c88a9f629625c09f50651f6f3c60

This is what I call horse blanket money. First off I want to state the obvious, these horses fuck. Lots of people own horses.  But if you're driving by someone's field and you see a horse roaming around with their own damn fashionable blanket that is the fastest way to detect wealth.  How did these people get horse blankets?  With horse blanket money.  How do they get horse blanket money?  By probably making 50% or more every damn time on their IPO investment more reliably than Tim Donaghy picking a basketball game (watch the netflix special if you haven't already).  Why is that?  Because FOMO is more powerful than any of the other psychological shit that goes into investing.  Almost every single IPO in the history of time has gone up before it went down.  Don't get greedy, take your 10% or more and move on.  The Chinese ones are extra special lately and I have no idea why, but until the government shuts down whatever fuckery they are pulling that is going to continue.  It has got me significant money for my poor ass this year so far.  And no I'm not talking about getting into these pre-live date.  I am talking about after they post on the brokerages to the public, you don't have to be any sort of special to pull this off.  

This week we have **K N W N** going live on the Nasdaq which is somewhat unique because it isn't a full fledged IPO it is just an OTC getting upgraded to the big boy league, which makes sense because they make some pretty cool tech for Diabetics (basically everyone that lives in America) to monitor glucose levels without breaking the skin.  It is already up 68% at one point today, hasn't gone live on the Nasdaq yet.  

Then we have **W L D S** which is also some cool wearable AI VR tech out of Israel, and if you followed my previous posts the last company out of Israel went 100% (took profit) and then tanked.  

DON'T GET GREEDY.  Also make sure to watch Rounders and pay attention to Joey Knisch as I stated previously if you haven't already.  Great lessons there modeled after a live person.  

Side note I feel like we live in a simulation.  With my winnings so far I got my driveway paved, I then drove a rubber tracked 18k lbs excavator on it and tore it all to hell even though the asphalt guy promised I could after X amount of time.  But then the 60k+ lbs concrete truck with way smaller contact patch size went across the same asphalt same day no problem.  The next day I saw the same black cat cross the driveway twice.  Glitch in the matrix if you ask me.  

Anyways.  Horse blanket money, get u some."|0.69|28|0|28

Heard Cramer going all in on tesla, so maybe some tesla puts...but I dunno, there's a saying around here not to bet against Mr musk.

[soon may the tendieman come](https://preview.redd.it/5yo2zm225am91.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d5ee3fc0d8c3b349a1c8ca82e086d2906dfb207)

* I'm sure you've all heard of Getty images (GETY), they give people pictures and charge them for it or something. In my humble opinion it doesn‚Äôt work great \[[test query](https://www.gettyimages.com/videos/pawg-milf?assettype=film&amp;phrase=pawg%20milf)\], but that‚Äôs besides the point. The real tragedy is that this stock‚Äôs beautiful setup might go to waste. A 508k float, 80+% short interest, high cost to borrow, and a loaded options chain.
* The company went public on July 25th as a deSPAC \[[ticker change announcement](https://investors.gettyimages.com/news-releases/news-release-details/getty-images-and-cc-neuberger-principal-holdings-ii-complete)\]. Fortunately, the SPAC had a lot of redemptions, leaving only a \~508k float and options. Following deSPAC, it ran to about $30 in a few days and stayed there for nearly a month, before dipping to \~$15 on a generally poor market and S1 jitters. Still, the float remains tiny \[[Bloomberg terminal screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/iPVuBZo.png)\], SI is still high, CTB is high (875%), and the options chain is loaded.

High open interest on OTM calls

* The entire chain is loaded up on this micro float for the September 16 expiry. As you move on up to $30, \~8000 calls come in the money \[[optionistics screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/QRwWvl2.png), [optionistics link](https://www.optionistics.com/quotes/stock-option-chains/GETY)\], meaning options sellers (usually market makers who don‚Äôt want to take an actual position on the stock) will likely hedge and buy shares to remain neutral as the options‚Äô price accelerates. I‚Äôm sure you guys know this script by now, it worked for GameStop in January 2021, for AMC in summer 2021, and for System1 in April 2022. If this works out, MMs may end up buying 800K shares (more than the entire float) and we should get something of a pump, at the next strike of $35 we have \~3000 yalls being held, so another 300k shares. At \~1.1m shares, that‚Äôs more than double the current free float.

S1 EFFECT

* A possible hiccup on the free float is a potential S1 EFFECT coming which would increase the float, but if we look at recent deSPACs we can estimate that an EFFECT filing is likely at least two weeks away. You can see that in this chart \[[chart](https://twitter.com/BKAT23/status/1564985856825376769)\]. Bears have been celebrating the S1 filing and loading up on September 16 puts \[[puts side of chain](https://i.imgur.com/fbdBNz2.png)\], but I'm betting EFFECT comes after September mopex.

Sky high SI

* Short interest is also high, at &gt;80% last I checked \[[SI #](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/gety?mod=md_funds_majorHoldings),   Barron's\]. High SI is always good news on a play like this, it may result in better price action if this gets moving.

Max Pain

* Something interesting here is that max pain for the September 16 expiry is at the $30 strike \[[max pain screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Qr4yvfi.png), [max pain site](https://maximum-pain.com/options)\]. For those that don‚Äôt know, max pain is where option sellers can burn the most option buyers (puts and yalls) and make the most money. A lot of people think max pain theory \[[Max Pain Theory explanation on Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp#:~:text=The%20Maximum%20Pain%20theory%20states,of%20options%20to%20expire%20worthless)\] is bunk, but (anecdotally) I‚Äôve seen low floats get pinned to max pain close to expiry somewhat often. If we hit $30 due to max pain pinning, then we may hit our escape velocity (calls come in the money, MMs hedge, price goes up)

Okay that‚Äôs about it

TLDR: microfloat (500k), with a loaded options chain, high SI (88% by last check), high CTB, can get pinned to $30 because of max pain, maybe it runs. Market sucks rn and lots of people are dumping speculative plays like this, so maybe it doesnt run

My position: 10 15c and 20 20c, I think it‚Äôs worth a lotto. If price goes up I‚Äôll go further OTM."|0.5|0|0|0

Hell, you'd even have people saying ""LOL I bet you won't double down"" and encouraging people to *make shitty bets even harder*. This sub was the birthplace of celebrating 0DTEs and FDs and laughing together when they were for nothing.

But now? People bitch that the culture of this sub has been changed by Meme Stocks while unironically telling people ETFs to trade, how to diversify their portfolio, and how to calculate risk. Sure, there was a bit of that in the old old days from a few key members who were this sub's sages, but it was mostly people making wild bets, and them not paying off, then commiserating in the comments together about it.

So, if you're shitting on people for making bad bets rather than joking *with them*, and you've also not placed any bets like a sidelining pussy, then you're just as much a catalyst for the culture change in this sub as anyone else you'd otherwise blame.

Remember TWLO? The high growth tech stock that peaked near $400 June 2021? Well, it's testing 52wk lows right now ($66), but I'm here to tell you why it will be reaching for the stars once again by Q3 2023... and more importantly, how you can make tendies from it. 

MOST IMPORTANT: Twilio company guidance has laid out a plan to create non GAAP profitability by Q3 2023. 

How does this make me tendies you may ask... Well, until now TWLO has been spending money like it's going out of style. They have acquired 4 companies since July 2020 including Segment for 3.2 Billion and Zipwhip for 850 Million. The fact that the CEO's focus has diverted from acquiring assets to bringing the company back to profitability implies a fundamental shift in the company's direction. They now have the tools to grow past the heights they reached in 2021 and that growth starts now. 

Why is Twilio undervalued right now? TWLO has the illusion of bleeding money with no end in sight. Showing a Non GAAP loss from operations of 7.3 million and a¬† GAAP loss from operations of 311.9 million in Q2 2022. This loss appears to be the main reason why the share price has been drilling since summer 2021, HOWEVER, we need to understand why the company is operating at a loss and that leads back to... acquisitions and marketing. TWLO has spent billions on company acquisitions and hundreds of millions on marketing in order to have the tools and recognition to turn enormous profits from Q3 2023 onward. 

Twilio is far from a dying company showing Q2 2022 revenue of 943.4 million, up 41% YOY. Also, Q2 2022 saw them signing their largest flex deal to date. Which is important, due to the fact that they deal with many large companies already such as lyft, Airbnb, coca cola, Salesforce, and the list goes on. This company intends to continue to increase revenues and decimate their expenditures which should lead to an extreme boost in their valuation. 

Extremely bullish. LONG TWLO before Q3 2023.

https://ir.alaunos.com/news-releases/news-release-details/alaunos-therapeutics-announces-early-clinical-data-showing

The key part is ‚ÄúFirst patient dosed achieved a confirmed objective partial response‚Äù

Let me translate that into English for you: $TCRT fucking cured cancer. 

And not some cancer we already know how to cure ‚Äì it cured a type of cancer that is currently a death sentence. I am not bullshitting you. This isn‚Äôt some fraudulent penny stock. The data is going to be presented at a reputable cancer conference in September, and it‚Äôs being presented by a clinical oncologist from The MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, not some promotional CEO at a Wall Street conference. If you don‚Äôt believe me, keep reading, I‚Äôve got the receipts. 

Okay, for those of you who have an attention span longer than a chimpanzee, let‚Äôs take a step back. 

$TCRT is an immuno-oncology company. They‚Äôre utilizing a TCR Therapy (hence the ticker, TCRT) to treat solid tumor cancers. Solid tumor cancers represent the vast majority of cancers that occur in the world. Oversimplifying this too much, TCRT takes out some of the patient‚Äôs t-cells, gives them a WANTED poster with a picture of the bad cancer sells, teach them to shoot guns, and then put those t-cells back into the patient‚Äôs body to go hunt down and kill the cancer cells like John Wick. 

Back in May the company announced they dosed their first patient in their clinical trial at MD Anderson. This patient has KRAS G12D small cell lung cancer that was previously treated with more conventional methods, but those methods didn‚Äôt cure the cancer. This is not surprising. KRAS is a type of cancer mutation that is basically not curable. KRAS mutations are also present in 80%+ of pancreatic cancers, which is why pancreatic cancers are basically a death sentence (RIP Steve Jobs). This patient had lung cancer, not pancreatic, but whatever. 

Before the press release about the conference came out, we already we pretty fucking sure this was going to work BECAUSE IT HAS ALREADY BEEN PROVEN TO WORK BEFORE. In June of 2022, an article was published IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE, about how a doctor named Eric Tran treated a patient with a similar TCRT therapy and cured their cancer. And it gets even better, that patient also had a KRAS G12D mutation. So, a different doctor treating the same type of cancer with the same type of therapy has already proven this works. 

And it gets EVEN BETTER. You‚Äôll note that at the end of the article it says: ‚ÄúDr. Tran‚Äôs work is supported by the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D.‚Äù Who is Dr. Steven Rosenberg? He‚Äôs literally the most important guy at the National Cancer Institute when it comes to cancer immunology. He‚Äôs also literally the guy that performed the surgery to remove President Ronald Reagan‚Äôs cancer. He‚Äôs the fucking man. HE IS ALSO RUNNING TCRT‚ÄôS CLINICAL TRIAL FOR THE SAME TCR THERAPY AT THE NCI. Unfortunately, that trial has not been able to dose a patient yet because of COVID + Government bureaucracy, but you can be sure he wouldn‚Äôt be fucking around with this if he didn‚Äôt think it was going to work.
Carrying along the analogy from before, the risk all along with this company/trial has been that they would never figure out how to successfully manufacture the John Wick version of the t-cells. But now we know for sure that they figured it out!

Okay, back to the present day. The company dosed the first patient in May. This morning the company put out the press release linked at the top of this post. Just to repeat, the crucial part is: ‚ÄúFirst patient dosed achieved a confirmed objective partial response‚Äù

‚ÄúOBJECTIVE PARTIAL RESPONSE‚Äù as defined by RECIST is a reduction in the size of the patient‚Äôs tumor by &gt;30%.
On top of being significant because they proved this cancer treatment works, it‚Äôs significant because this trial has an escalating dose procedure. This patient only got 5 billion John Wick cells put into them. Dr. Eric Tran put 16 billion John Wick cells into his patient. Because of the success with the first patient, TCRT also announced they got approval to move to the next dose level with the next patient, which is 40 billion John Wick cells. So even if this first patient saw a tumor reduction that is &gt;30% but &lt;100%, we can assume the next patients, getting 8x the dose level, will respond even better. 
What do you think a cure for previously incurable solid tumor cancers is? Well, Merck is currently in negotiations to buy $SGEN for $30-$40bn+ and this is way fucking better than that.  $AZN is also a multi-hundred-billion dollar company investing heavily in TCR Therapy. The head of their TCR Therapy group has posted LinkedIn content in which he has tagged $TCRT employees. I'll let you draw the line connecting those dots. 

The company currently has a $450mm market cap. So fair value is probably up &gt;100x from here. 
 
Wall Street is already starting to figure this out, but slowly. The stock is up a lot on huge volume in the last few weeks. It should be going way the fuck higher in short order.

P.S. As a cherry on top, short sellers attacked this company before they changed their name. So, we can get some justice on the shorts in the process.

Russia is a top 3 oil and gold producer in the world, and benefits greatly from the high prices caused by inflation and international conflict. In fact, Russia‚Äôs aggression in Ukraine looks like a very smart move, since the rest of the world doesn‚Äôt seem to be doing anything about it. Even more so, Russia‚Äôs escalation of war may actually be a boost to its economy (regardless of international sanctions) because its actions have led to high prices for the Energy and Gold it produces. Unless the U.S. and Europe make a concerted effort to increase Oil, Gas, and Gold production in order to decrease prices, Russia has a major upper hand and economic incentive to continue its aggression.

The U.S. and its allies must increase production and work on lowering Energy prices. This would not only help weaken Russia, but also greatly help the economy and the consumer by fighting inflation and the rising input costs. For decades, we have heard about ‚Äúenergy independence‚Äù and lowering energy costs; now is the time for the government, lawmakers, and the energy industry to take action!

**KEY FACTS**

* Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC)‚Äîthe Nasdaq-listed blank check company which has agreed to acquire Truth Social‚Äôs parent company Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG) and take it public‚Äîfailed to garner the requisite 65% votes needed to extend the completion of the deal by an additional year, Reuters reported, citing ‚Äúpeople familiar with the matter.‚Äù
* The company recently claimed the voting process has been challenging because most of its shareholders are individuals and their votes need to be secured through their brokers.
* The company has sought until September 8, 2023 to complete the deal, an extension beyond the customary two-year deadline‚Äîwhich expires on Thursday‚Äîduring which a SPAC is required to complete an acquisition.
* The final vote tally will be announced Tuesday, but Reuters reports that the company‚Äôs executives are already exploring alternatives‚Äîwhich include a unilateral six-month extension without shareholder approval‚Äîas they believe they will meet the 65% threshold.
* If DWAC fails to deal with the issue before Thursday‚Äôs September 8 deadline, it will be forced to liquidate its shares and return the money it raised in its initial public offering.

Beaten down by FUD bringing float into question, due for major recovery!|"\*\*I'm going to start with the TLDR - GETY float is still 508,311. Some FUD brought that into question which drove the stock price down. But IR confirmed float hasn't changed. Great buy opportunity. Should be able to reclaim $20 this week. 90% short interest. 1000% cost to borrow.\*\*

A couple weeks back, I wrote about the $GETY play. 508,311 float had just been confirmed by Bloomberg Terminal. Short interest was in the 80% range. Stock went from $25 to $33. It was a good trade.

What has happened since? Why is the stock suddenly under $15? Filings and FUD.

First filing was an 8k on Aug 26 that said earnout shares were being issued due to stock performance. What everyone seemed to ignore was this sentence...*The eligible former GGH equity holders have previously agreed to be subject to a 180-day lock-up in respect of the Earn-Out Shares, and they may not sell or transfer (subject to customary exceptions) the Earn-Out Shares until the expiration of the lock-up period on January 19, 2023*

This still brought the stock down to the low $20's. Next, we had the filing that really ""killed"" the play because it brought on ""massive dilution."" At least, that was the FUD spread on Twitter, StockTwits, etc. This was a form 4 filing from Neuberger stated that they exercised warrants. The filing confused many into thinking that at least 3.5m shares were being dumped into the float. Unfortunately, people didn't realize how a cashless warrant exercise works. They basically exercised the right to 9.3m shares and it cost them 3.5m shares to do so. So, they're left with 5.8m shares (9.3-3.5). BUT, those 5.8m shares AREN'T ADDED TO THE FLOAT (Confirmation email from IR below). And, the 3.5m shares aren't either.

It's also important to note that the drop from the 8k was on only 343k in volume on the day and the drop from the Form 4 was on 501k in volume. So, as we all know, with tiny floats, low volume can move it either way pretty easily.  Now that we've answered the FUD, it wouldn't take much volume to get this back up above $20.

https://preview.redd.it/lcrq5urzp8m91.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34a825d3fae0175e3f889924330245593f05e432

So, the 8k and Form 4 both brought this stock down from the $26-33 range to the $13-15 range. This gives us a massive opportunity. We still have 508,311 float. We now have 90% short interest. We have Fintel and Ortex both updating the float while the stock was being driven down. $GETY is now #11 on the Fintel Short Squeeze list, but will soon be #1-2 based on the tiny float, very high short interest, oh and 1000% cost to borrow!

https://preview.redd.it/70qf76m1q8m91.png?width=2022&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d33ff36e6294ad9c81d99385a20654741ebd6590

My play is September $14 and $15 calls, and a few $20 lottos. There is no reason this stock can't be back to at least $20, so we're looking at massive gains here. We recently saw another low float despac play go from $12 to $24 with inclusion on Fintel Squeeze List.

And when money is flowing out of a sector, you might see pops get successfully shorted and bearish trends establish themselves.

I use the Growth 250 list created by Investor's Business Daily (of which I am unaffiliated) to understand the depth and breadth of the market any given week. This is their best estimation of the top 250 growth stocks in the market. I keep a running study of this list, tracking money flows between subsectors.

# So Where is Smart Money Going Right Now?

**TL;DR... This week:**

*Long Side*

1. *Aerospace/Defense:* NOC LMT
2. *Energy-Solar:* ENPH FSLR ARRY
3. *Food-Packaged:* CPB CAG GIS TWNK SJM
4. *Insurance-Various:* WRB ACGL PGR
5. *Medical-Biomed/Biotech:* VRTX APLS CPRX

*Short Side*

1. Semiconductor Equipment: TER ASML
2. Freight Transportation: YELL ODFL ZIM CP XPO

# Our Findings:

A lot of changes from the last week when the Fed looks to be getting ready for another big rate hike. On the long side, there we see some rotation into defense-type plays. Sectors to watch: *Aerospace/Defense,* *Energy-Solar,* *Food-Packaged,* *Insurance* and *Medical-Biomed/Biotech.* To the short side, we are looking at a pause for *Oil &amp; Gas* with more damage coming to sub groups that service semiconductor manufacturing, in addition to lower freight demand signaling investors to sell *Transportation.*

***The Long Side***

1. ***Aerospace/Defense:*** With more and more weapons flowing from American companies to the war in Ukraine, the Department of Defense is going to make it even easier for US Defense companies to sell their products to other countries in need as well. Most of the names in the sector trade on lighter volume so the best companies are very hard to trade. A few tickers to follow with enough liquidity include the usual players NOC LMT
2. ***Energy-Solar:*** With these names holding big moves they made a month ago, they seem to be setting up again with a good amount of inflow this past week. ENPH is the sector leader but FSLR ARRY are both expecting some crazy growth in the coming quarters.
3. ***Food-Packaged:*** Here we have a nice defense sector that is showing some strength with a large amount of names getting inflow. These are not huge movers but great defense plays for a potentially choppy week coming in. We like CPB CAG GIS TWNK SJM for their fundamentals and will be watching them all week.
4. ***Insurance - Various:*** When insurance companies are allowed to invest the premiums they hold into bonds, they benefit from rising yields like we are seeing right now. This is why these are seeing an uptick. Some solid names to watch include WRB ACGL PGR
5. ***Medical-Biomed/Biotech:*** We are seeing more flows into ‚Äòdefense-growth‚Äô healthcare plays as well ‚Äî which has been a theme off and on for some time this year. The key is they get their revenue from governments and large corporations which are dependable and consistent regardless of economic conditions. We like VRTX APLS CPRX

***The Short Side***

1. ***Semiconductor Equipment:*** These are a lot of companies that supply equipment and supplies for semiconductor manufacturing. This selling represents the damage that is suffered upstream as the entire semiconductor sector struggles and this is now flattening out to the outlier players like these. Some potential shorts right now are: TER ASML
2. ***Freight Transportation - Various:*** We are seeing lowering demand for freight transport and projecting even lower traffic for next year. A few names to watch for weakness: YELL ODFL ZIM CP XPO

# Review: Last Week

Last week we looked for longs in *Chemicals-Agricultural* *Oil &amp; Gas* and *Utilities.*

Ag chemicals continued to consolidate, shaking out weak holders and creating a nice handle. *Oil &amp; Gas* was a bit stronger but also remained inside last week‚Äôs high and continues to consolidate. The strongest names made modest gains on the week.

The market agreed much more with our predictions on the short side. *Computer software* was an easy target as growth companies are getting slapped by more hawkish posturing by The Fed. We targeted a few companies that are overvalued with highly specialized and under-diversified product or service ‚Äî the **DDOG short idea finished -9% on the week with OKTA closing -30%.**

# Why Look at Market Rotation?

Day traders can use subsector momentum studies like this one to identify momentum stocks and develop greater conviction in a predicted move.

Keeping an eye on this flow has proven to be a¬†*huge boon*¬†to our edge. We have found that when we trade in subsectors that are having changes in money flow that there is an increased level of continuation that correlates to the flow, whether positive or negative. And to put it simply, this translates into bigger moves with reduced chop.

Momentum studies like these can help make trading simpler. Even so, we believe in the trading community and that's why we share our research. As always, drop your thoughts and questions in the comments."|0.78|20|0|20

Vancouver ‚Äì August 8, 2022 ‚Äì Pampa Metals Corp. (‚ÄúPampa Metals‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (CSE: PM / FSE: FIRA / OTCQX¬Æ: PMMCF) is pleased to report the reception of key radiometric age dating and petrographic studies of quartz-veinlet stockwork samples from the Buenavista target at the Company‚Äôs Block 4 Project, which is located 110 km south of the Escondida mining district in the Cordillera de Domeyko porphyry belt in northern Chile.  
The recently obtained Tertiary geological age date is an important additional component adding to the attractiveness of the Buenavista Target. The most productive porphyry copper deposits along the Domeyko Cordillera mineral belt all have Tertiary-aged hydrothermal systems. This data point adds to the geological, geochemical, and geophysical information acquired by Pampa Metals, which together comprise a compelling case for Buenavista to represent a priority drill target along the Domeyko Cordillera ‚Äì the most productive copper belt in the world. Further geophysical anomalies ‚Äì combined magnetic and IP responses ‚Äì under post-mineral cover to the east and north of Buenavista represent additional drill targets of high interest.  
Paul Gill, Pampa Metals‚Äô CEO, stated: ‚Äú""We are delighted with the latest information from the Buenavista Target. Although no two porphyry systems are exactly the same, the overwhelming evidence to date is that there is a significant system to investigate by drilling at Buenavista, together with several other geophysical anomalies located within the property that appear to have a similar signature.""  
DETAILS &amp; KEY FINDINGS:  
‚Ä¢ Pampa Metals geologists selected valid samples of the central Buenavista porphyry and quartz-veinlet stockwork zone for radiometric age dating and petrographic studies, which were forwarded to the Chilean National Geological Institution (‚ÄúSernageomin‚Äù) and to a prominent Chilean petrographer with extensive experience in porphyry systems, respectively.  
‚Ä¢ A radiometric age date of 60.3 +/- 1.0 Ma (U-Pb; zircon) corresponds to the host rock of the porphyry-type quartz-veinlet stockwork with molybdenum anomalies found at the Buenavista target in Block 4 (see previous news releases dated June 23, May 24, May 3, March 15, 2022, and October 18, 2021).  
o This confirms that the Buenavista target is a Tertiary-aged hydrothermal system.  
‚Ä¢ Petrographic studies of the age-dated rock sample show that it corresponds to a magmatic-phreatomagmatic breccia with dacite porphyry clasts, which is highly leached with a ""vuggy silica"" texture and evidence of silica, illite-sericite, quartz, alunite, and pyrophyllite hydrothermal alteration assemblages. Relicts of leached pyrite mineralization were also determined.  
o At least three types of quartz veinlets were identified: i) saccharoidal quartz with bands of fluid and solid micro-inclusions; ii) gray crustiform quartz with bands of fluid and solid micro-inclusions and with the development of banded dark veins; and iii) low temperature veinlets comprising quartz in rosettes.  
o All of these contain pyrite micro-inclusions, with late fractures occupied by goethite after coarse pyrite, and rare native gold flakes.  
CONCLUSIONS:  
The Early Tertiary (Paleocene) age date obtained for the host rock porphyry at the Buenavista target in Block 4 would be the first for the Sierra Vaquillas Altas area in northern Chile. This age is equivalent to that of intrusions to the southeast at Cerros Corral de Alambre, and to that of volcanic rocks to the northwest in the western block of the El Profeta and Sierra de Varas faults, both of which have been associated with the magmatism of the widespread Chile-Alemania Formation.  
A Paleocene age is considered the maximum age for the porphyry system at the Buenavista target, but may in fact represent the host rock for a younger porphyry event. This is a situation described for other porphyry deposits along the Cordillera de Domeyko porphyry belt, such as El Salvador located 115 km SSW of Block 4, where mineralizing porphyry intrusions from the Middle Eocene are intruded into Lower-Middle Paleocene magmatic rocks.  
The petrographic study revealed successive pulses of hydrothermal infill, with at least three generations of porphyry-style quartz veinlets cutting through an initial phreatomagmatic brecciation event. Hydrothermal alteration associations indicate that the system is exposed at a relatively high level between the phyllic and epithermal transition, which is consistent with oxidised relicts of pyrite mineralization in the centre, together with evidence of quartz-sulfide structures with copper-gold-silver-arsenic values observed around the periphery of the Buenavista stockwork zone.  
The geologic age date and petrographic study provide strong support for Pampa Metals‚Äô plans for drill testing of the previously undrilled Buenavista target, in addition to previously reported results from geological mapping, ground magnetics surveying, and induced polarisation reconnaissance survey lines. Field collection of more than 2,500 soil samples centred on the Buenavista target has recently been completed, with results pending.  
ABOUT BUENAVISTA &amp; BLOCK 4  
A ground magnetics survey and follow-up geological fieldwork led to the discovery of a porphyry-related quartz-veinlet stockwork zone spatially coincident with a dacite porphyry and magnetic anomaly (see news release dated October 18, 2021), subsequently named the Buenavista target. A limited trenching program returned anomalous molybdenum geochemistry associated with the stockwork zone, together with copper and gold values around the margins, including 24m @ 0.14% Cu and (separately) 24m @ 0.25 g/t Au (see news released date March 15, 2022).  
The trenching program at Buenavista revealed relicts of coarse chalcopyrite disseminations from a skarn-type system on the eastern edge of the stockwork zone, as well as green and black copper oxide mineralization from in-situ oxidation of chalcopyrite-pyrite mineralisation in a quartz-sulfide breccia on the west flank of the stockwork. Gold anomalies are also associated with this latter area.  
Simultaneous soil geochemistry and reconnaissance pole-dipole IP geophysical surveys were initiated in May 2022, centred on the Buenavista target. Highly encouraging IP results were published (see news released dated June 23, 2022), and field sampling for the soil survey totalling around 2,500 samples is 100% completed, with all assay results pending. Soil sampling results will be published in due course.

With all the recent drama surrounding the company, I believe that a vast majority of investors are missing a crucial piece of DD that could send this stock soaring to heights the market has never seen before. I've been a pretty well respected investor among my friends, so I figured I would drop a little research I have been conducting over the past few months.

**The Thesis:**

Nicholas Cage has always been public about his love for BBBY, claiming the company has inspired his acting style. I believe he will soon go public with his plans to buyout Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, potentially injecting a much needed cashflow and revitalizing their public image.

&amp;#x200B;

[Cage making an appearance at the opening of BBBYs superstore in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. circa 1999](https://preview.redd.it/l2pt5j0ro5m91.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb35bd9d610e1ca8e9ab78f17e564e0f81626c8a)

**The Marriage:**

Anyone that follows Mr. Cage is well aware that in February 2021, Nicholas married his 5th wife, Riko Shibata: [Source.](https://hollywoodlife.com/2021/03/05/nicolas-cage-married-riko-shibata-las-vegas-wedding/) I fully believe that they created their wedding registry though BBBY, and I think Nicholas had something up his sleeve here....

&amp;#x200B;

[Confused? Don't be. Many don't know about Nicholas's secret marriage to author Andrea Zimmerman in September 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/r63yfi2en5m91.png?width=951&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e28a1df4887be35ca17c755b00f38799ae712e7)

**I believe that Nicholas has been using his multiple marriages to secretly funnel liquidity in to the company through the use of Wedding Registries.** 

It's clear that the Cage + Zimmerman Registry being public was just a slip up, or maybe an intentional misdirection by Cage; as the Registry is very low value. In any event, the real Registries are absolutely not posted publicly; but we can assume that Nicholas is creating ones in the 5-10M range before purchasing items off the list using his own capital. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Cage photographed by Riko during a weekend shopping trip.](https://preview.redd.it/a099bwqzs5m91.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f518ef8534c2c61cdc16b4a5f96a816deeede55)

**The Child:**

Here's where it gets interesting... 

&amp;#x200B;

[Buy Buy Baby? Cage confirmed the pregnancy in January 2022.](https://preview.redd.it/d2j3va2ct5m91.png?width=990&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9544385492c32c9a2be6a7517a6b8462a3d77d84)

Here's the Buy Buy Baby connection everyone's been looking for. Baby Registry is the next logical step here and if we look at the date of the pregnancy announcement...

t3_x6z8vj|1662433271|wallstreetbets|Dear Americans|"The last weeks I‚Äôve read a lot of people talking about Europe‚Äôs gas problem especially Germany. Let me clarify a few things for you:

First of all the basics since most of you don‚Äôt know:

**Germany is located in the center of Europe**. It‚Äôs that one place that you‚Äôve probably seen on a map in your history class about world war 2. Yea the one with the *cross symbol*.

Secondly since **we will all freeze like in Russia:**

Germany has mild winters. There‚Äôs rarely snow in the majority of the country. It‚Äôs usually between 0-10C ( **~30-50 Freedom units** )

Let‚Äôs talk about gas price. Yes it went up. But did you know that even tho we are europoors we actually aren‚Äôt THAT poor? It‚Äôll go up for me for example 70‚Ç¨/month. That‚Äôs 70$.

And since we talk about money Germany is rank #4 when it comes to GDP. And we also have something called ‚Äúa social program‚Äù 

I KNOW! Scary words! But let me explain! In the worst case scenario the government actually *cares* about the less fortunate and helps them with money. So even if you can‚Äôt afford gas you probably will end up getting support and still be able to pay! Sounds ridiculous I know but shit works.

I really appreciate that you care this much about our well being but things are really not looking as bad as some might think. Probably because the last time you heard about a Europe crisis Germany was also a major topic but I promise it‚Äôs different this time! 

Yours,

Friendly German

t3_x6yt08|1662431988|wallstreetbets|Vera Bradley is Undervalued by a Large Degree due to Commodity Pressures|"**Prelude:** *Vera Bradley* is a women's high-end fashion company. They make handbags, purses, and other crap that your wife's boyfriend buys for your cheating son of a foul. *Vera Bradley* is currently trading at its lowest price since the Coronavirus pandemic, which had prevented anyone from going to their in-store locations. I believe that the recent disastrous earnings report is a blessing in disguise. That means their stable sales, the low volume of goods in cargo ships exiting China, and thus deflation on the premiums paid to cargo services, the deflation of commodity prices, a possible new CEO, and cost-cutting combined with an extremely strong balance sheet. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Sales:** Vera Bradley's Sales Have Stayed Flat From Its Last Position in 2021

&amp;#x200B;

[The Revenue Chart I got from YCharts](https://preview.redd.it/smyoz9bta5m91.png?width=1195&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ea1c1e597a0ee2206033f8d7eb18be6d0f791af)

Revenue in July of 2021 was $147 million, and it was $130 million in July of 2022. For a company that produces luxury handbags, this drop in revenue is not catastrophic. In fact, according to their earnings call in Q1, **"" full-line revenues were above last year as customers with higher household incomes remained engaged and spent more than last year...""** and **"", inflationary pressures, including rates, including rising gas prices, particularly impacted the spending of Vera Bradley customers with household incomes below $55,000...""** What does this mean? It means that wealthier customers are still consuming, and customers that are in the middle to the lower class are feeling the brunt of rate hikes, and the commodity squeeze, I will get into that more later. These stable sales will come to bring Vera Bradley more revenue when the economy eventually stabilizes, which it already is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cargo Prices have been going Down for the Last Year and Should Eventually Reach Pre Covid Levels, Lowering the Cost of Revenue for Product Transported From China

&amp;#x200B;

[Chart from Statistica](https://preview.redd.it/o1vdmsuvd5m91.png?width=876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66799872bb767938d9bdf9ffc09094ed28065631)

Not very much to explain here. This will lower shipping costs for Vera Bradley. Actually, in Q4 of the last year, at the height, shipping costs took away about 1/3 of their earnings, **"" The incremental freight costs and GSP impact combined affected our EPS by approximately $0.25 for the full year. Excluding these two items would have put earnings in line with our original guidance of $0.80 to $0.90.""** Freight costs are still about 3X the mean in 2019, so the reduction in it will be beneficial. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Oil Prices:**  Gas prices have affected the revenue of the lower-middle class of Vera Bradley's customer base. It has also affected their freight operation. Oil prices are actively lowering, so it will both lower costs of revenue and will increase revenue itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

**New CEO:** I dunno, they're on a search for a new CEO. They may steer the company in another direction. Just something to keep in mind for the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Cost Cutting/Balance Sheet:** Vera Bradley wants to do $25 million worth of cost-cutting this year. This means cutting off the fat on employees and through the manufacturing process. Vera Bradley's balance sheet is absolutely magical. Even though it is mostly comprised of inventory, I think that the demand for it makes it liquid. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u915dbolh5m91.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8c6051e8a11629edacec4760f009237c39696bd

&amp;#x200B;

**Price to Book Value on VRA on the top
 But what about the earnings crash, you may say?** What about it? Vera Bradley still increased their revenue by about $30 million as the economy is crawling toward a new normal. Oil prices are going down, and rates, too. Obviously, those may be a risk, too, but I don't think it'll affect it much. You've seen the revenue chart, it is relatively unchanged from when cash was practically free."|0.33|0|0|0

In 14 years the FED balance sheet has almost hit a 10 bagger. Yowza! This line looks horrible considering its current trajectory and that each dose of QE has dwarfed the previous dose. Do you think the FED will successfully shrink this? Pause while I take a moment to congratulate the FED on its current effort to curb rising prices due to inflation. Fed, congratulations, you have raised the FED funds rate to crisis levels (well at least what used to be crisis levels). Great job. And...the economy and market can barely even handle rates rising slightly.

[ Assets: Total Assets: Total Assets \(Less Eliminations from Consolidation\): Wednesday Level \(WALCL\) | FRED | St. Louis Fed \(stlouisfed.org\) ](https://preview.redd.it/ant5f2yx94m91.png?width=1457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b389ac7b151dcb352ae179380ea4bb69d4b9a48b)

At least we don't have to worry about the FED continuing to print money out of thin air. They are serious about this inflation thing and are definitely going go stop injecting stimulus into to economy. I mean, the last time they said that they followed through. Amirite? Nope, they pivoted right away.  It was a big fat fail.

But this time is different. The economy is strong as it has ever been. The job market has never had more openings or more job creation (well if you don't count those pandemic job losses). GDP is also awesome...especially if you remove those imports. People can afford energy, groceries and shelter easily. The infrastructure has never been better and requires hardly any updates. We have invested wisely. Pensions are fully funded, healthcare is cheap and easily accessible and the military industrial complex has slowed down and focused its efforts on world peace. Oh, shit, I goofed. I don't think any of that is true.

Shit, old people didn't pillage the social safety nets did they? Maybe they did. There should be more than 3 trillion right? Damn I think they did.

The NIH is probably making bank on the patents our tax dollars fund. I heard recently that they got like $350 million or something. They gotta be a hella profit center? It has to be.

Woooooohoooooo! Fiscal gap isn't even listed. And hell to the fucking yeah. 97.6 trillion. Bow chica bow wow. Get the strippers and coke. It is time to retire on the government. I am squinting a bit because of the being high. Oh no. Fuck no. Those aren't parenthesis I see are they. FUUUUUUUUCK! Are these also negative numbers? Who flung the poo that is true?

97.6+33.4 = 131 trillion. No big deal. I mean, we have like 261+ million ounces of gold. Right? Oh, that gold is owned by the FED and the Fed is not owned by the government but instead private member banks? Well, this story sucks. It is no good at all.

At least the government will do the responsible thing. They are definitely going to raise taxes and cut spending. They have a strong history of being fiscally responsible, right? Fuck, that is a Mom from Queens who has to balance her budget and can't spend more than is in her account. Silly me, I forgot the government doesn't follow the rules for thee. And here I thought the FED would not need to step in and monetize these debts.

I could be wrong but I think the FED might have to. ""We can guarantee cash benefits as far out and at whatever size you like, but we cannot guarantee their **purchasing power. "" --Alan Greenspan**

I guess Alan, when he was FED chair, wasn't lying.

Is there anything good about this? The good news is these numbers were like last year. It's not like they would get that much worse right? The government wouldn't spend more money than they take in? We wouldn't give money to Ukraine if we didn't have a surplus, right? Also, the CPLie was like 3.1% when the actuaries came up with this shit. I bet 9% inflation won't make it that much worse. I mean substitution, weighting and hedonics must be good for us as consumers am I right? Things are definitely going to cost less in the future. Dammit! None of that is right either. Can't the fucking house members and senators go behind Wendy's and bring in some fucking income?

Okay, so the only good news is that this might be providing the opPORNtunity of a lifetime. I know it is not super popular around here but a shiny industrial and monetary metal at around $18 is looking pretty fucking good. A few other commodities are sticking out as huge value plays.  At least to me. Do your own due diligence. I am not your financial advisor. This is not financial advice.

TL/DR: Bigger numbers are normally better, but not when they are negative. I think the government is admitting we are like 131 trillion in the hole. I am not an accountant. I am not that smart.

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, and my analysis usually does fairly well (check my post history for proof)

I'm starting a thing where I post weekly my analysis and plays for the upcoming week, I will be going through my plays for:

1. Earnings
2. Major Economic Events
3. My Watchlist
4. My Week lotto 10 bagger Play

There  is also a video on my channel (link in my profile) going through all  this, so you can check that out if you dont like reading

Ok so let's get this show on the road

**Earnings this week that I will play**

But before we go into the earnings, here is how I play earnings most of the time

How i play earnings:

* buy  shares whenever possible to avoid iv crush if you have a big account or  the shares are cheap or buy atm options ideally 1-2 weeks before  earnings to get a cheaper premium before iv spikes
* lotto  size plays, no matter how much dd you do, things don't necessarily go  as expected. you can be right and still lose money. i personally don‚Äôt  go over 5% size on any earning‚Äôs play
* the name of the game is guidance, a company can beat eps and revenue and still tank if guidance is bad

So now that this is out of the way, let's dig into it

* 6 months+ after lock-up expiration, insiders of $GTLB only sold 288.5k shares (\~0.2% of total outstanding shares)

So  this wraps up the earnings for this week, I should have bought last  week to avoid high premiums from iv spikes, so I'm going to place all my  calls and puts on Tuesday at the open, remember lotto size only

**Major Economic events this week**

https://preview.redd.it/fqgg3wooz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cbe5492878cfebe6c452aeda9fd851dd42d08d2

So  overall expectations are a relief rally this week all the way to JPow  speech at somewhere between $4017 which is major resistance and 50MA on  the daily and$ 4120 level which is another major resistance and 21MA on  $SPX and then the start of a major meltdown after that. so we have

Tuesday

10:00 am - Non-manufacturing PMI aug

Wednesday8:30 am - Balance of trade July

12:35 - Fed Brainard's speech

Thursday8:30 am - Initial jobless claims9:10 - 9:50 am - Fed Jerome Powell's speech

Friday

10:00 am - Wholesale Inventories

12:30 - Fed Walker Speech

As  far as the short-term market reaction is concerned, which is what we  are interested in now, most of these are all nonevents, with the  exception of JPow speech and PMI read. they are all critical for the  overall picture but the idea is to play these events.

Market  reaction to numbers has been mixed. market dumps on good numbers and  pumps on bad ones. i believe that the market basically uses these events  to run or dump based on what the charts give us. going with that  theory, my plays will be as follows:I'm expecting a continuation of  the Friday dump premarket so I will take SPX puts when pm opens, target  is 3860 or before PMI whichever comes first.Before PMI I expect a  relief rally all the way into the JPow speech on Thursday, i'm not sure  whether the market collapse starts at the JPow speech or CPI numbers on  the 13th. My targets for SPX calls are $4017 and $4120. so I will be  getting out of calls at these targets or before JPow speech whichever  comes first.My expectations are based on the chart levels below, the  market pumped on shit numbers and dumped on great numbers, the only  thing that has been consistent is the chart, they just tack on an excuse  for why the stock moved the way they wanted it to.

**Watchlist for this week**

* $MSFT  wins a $22B AR headset contract with the US army, I expect some more  pain in the market followed by a proper relief rally, $MSFT should run  hard on this news during the rally. I will take calls then, my target  would be the retest of the 50MA at $270.4, if the market tanks I'm  looking at $245 support as my first target

https://preview.redd.it/lgoqlyxlz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a9ab8bd363995221a115492efeddd859fd4cf26

* $AAPL  event starts on Wednesday, expected to reveal iPhone 14 among other  things, could see a run, if the market runs. we are currently right at  the 50MA on the daily and $155.6 support. if the market runs target is  $166.5 which is the 21MA, and if it tanks we will see $130 quickly

https://preview.redd.it/dzuwwcomz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dcc9faf7bd76b4d9db04798b92834768c9b453a

* $SAVA  3M in insider buys last month by directors and the chief medical  officer, if someone knows something about whether they pass the trials  or not, it would be this guy. more importantly, insiders sell for many  reasons but buy only for one, they think the stock will go up. low float  37M and 33% of float shorted, ran to $140 last year.

https://preview.redd.it/p7mqj7jnz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93cea75efe201e45fbfe83e6aaa7bf9974975e29

Taking  ATM calls here for Jan20 23 might wait for a drop to $15.4 support  before an entry, but we are at 50MA on the daily, so might take a  starter there. if phase 2 final data is positive, we can expect to hit  $65 resistance at least, phase 3 data may be available in early 2023.  I'm taking my time with entries here and may go for a longer expiry.

So  if you made it this far, I'm guessing this is what have been waiting  for, this is largely under the radar, but could play out Tuesday, and  book us a big win!

**Possible 10 bagger play for this week**

So  the $DWAC deadline to merge with truth social is Tuesday 09/06, if that  doesn't happen, which thanks to the SEC investigation it won't, the  stock dumps back to SPAC floor prices which is $10.

Now  the reason it's not already there, is that they have shareholder vote  for an extension after market close, but they need 65% approval to get a  6-month extension. with most people unaware of this, it seems unlikely  it will happen.

Not only that they  also have to put up $6m or $0.10 per share as collateral to get the  extension, which they don't get back if the merger doesn't go through.  we all know for political reasons will not go through in 6 months or  even a year.

So my play here is  $25p 9 Sep here, my thinking is that it won't pass. if it tanks to $10,  this could be a 10-bagger right there!

As  an important side note, please don't buy $10 puts, the floor price is  $10, and they will go to 0, even if the stock tanks to $10 because it  can't go below $10 (for the most part) so the market will price them as  worthless.

Alright, so that's it  for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the  previous week‚Äôs play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

It's frankly simplistic to say so. The newer satellites will no doubt have higher capacities then todays current satellites have. Why? Technology has changed from 15 to 20 years ago. Are not our phones and laptops having significantly higher performance from so long ago? All chips made today are much higher in performance so it stands to reason so will our new 17 satellites being planned as we wait. Just so the board knows: GSAT's current constellation as it currently exists handled  1,800,000,000 messages a year. Read that on GSAT's website! More capacity is coming soon as the newer satellites are launched and put into use as I do not see Apple and GSAT settling for 20 year old technology. Everything has gotten smaller, faster and higher capacity over the last 20 years and so will our next generation satellites in my opinion, it just makes sense.  GSAT has the spectrum in the S-Band and C -Band to handle much more traffic than it does now. Uplink: L-Band (1610-1618.725 MHz)Downlink: S-Band (2483.5-2500 MHz)Terrestrial: S-Band (2483.5-2500 MHz)Uplink: C-Band (5091-5250 MHz)Downlink: C-Band (6875-7055 MHz)\*\* Above from the GSAT website 2021 PresentationNoticer the S-band: it can be used as a satellite downlink and we have the right to use it here terrestrially as well.There is no FCC filings that I know of that seeks to change any of the above.

# Going to the second quarters earnings release shows a company truly getting ready to fire on all cylinders.  Why:  The recognition and release of the large IOT order of 23K devices with the likely purchase of additional devices. As GSAT advised this is likely to be a breakthrough for additional contracts and sales to other companies. They have made significant hire's in the IOT field which in my opinion have already paid off.  This regarding production issues from the 2nd quarter release:  As we resume production over the coming days and weeks, we expect equipment revenue to be meaningfully higher in the second half of 2022, leading to further subscriber revenue growth. Demand, particularly for Commercial IoT service and products, has not faltered even in the face of material supply issues. Sales orders continue to build at an impressive pace, and we will fulfill these orders expeditiously. Band 53/N53 GSAT is pending to release of additional approvals to bring the total of over one billion pops. Greater the number of POPs the greater value. We know there is a term sheet involving Band 53/N53. We already know that this will lead to an increase in GSAT's value, we just don't when the agreement will be released. I can't see the release lasting much beyond the new year, likely sooner imo.  Also, we know they are actively refinancing the debt of the company and for the capital they need for the new constellation of satellites.  Last but not least: we have the filing for a brand new constellation of 3080 satellites with the ITU from I believe their German subsidiary. That constellation they have applied for would be the same size of Amazons potential project Kuiper. Large enough to compete with anyone!  And so we additionally wait to see if Apple will the other terms agreement entity. Will they buy us out or make payments, we don't know and we won't until the announcement is made.  However, without recognition of the payments made to one of the terms agreements, GSAT had 23% higher revenue 2nd quarter. With the above sectors all coming online should show increasingly higher revenues and 4th quarter should be the first actual profit I have seen the company have since I've been here, imo. And it will not be any larger number for the profit but if GSAT manages to pull it off it will lead to a change with any partners for IOT as companies want to make sure they are with a company that will still be in business.  This is why I am very bullish on the long run prospects of GSAT and/or anyone who purchases GSAT.  Let's remember, Starlink has nothing to show and no approvals to even do what they say they want to.  GSAT has been doing everything for the last 10 years and has regulatory approval for it all right now: VOICE/TEXT/IOT.   I think its important to note that all GSAT or anyone else is talking about is moving data: bits and bytes - he digital world as we know it. No matter who partners with GSAT or buys GSAT - it's only moving data and it is beyond me to think that if any Computer company buys GSAT that the engineers are not capable to make this work. Especially Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc.   So yes I am tired hearing this can't be done or Starlink is the only one that can. All Starlink has right now is a name and thats it: No VOICE/IOT/TEXT. No regulatory approvals to do so. No application or software to make it so. No reason to fear them if we get a major technology company to partner with us or buy us.  What we will all have to do is wait for the NDA's to expire or permit GSAT to announce the partners or buyout and off we go. I hope."|0.7|11|0|11

* ES! (SPY) are up 0.30%
* NQ! (QQQ) are up 0.26%

Good evening everyone, I hope you all had a nice long three day weekend. Before the week starts its a good idea to look through the sector ETFs and major indices to help frame your mindset for how the market has been behaving. I ran through my list of sector and industry ETFs and there was very little strong leadership showing. The past few weeks have been rough on the entire market and it is being reflected across all sectors. However, that does not mean that we should not constantly be scanning because we can never know when the market will turn and we do not want to miss good opportunities.

https://preview.redd.it/1igoylotn3m91.png?width=2260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7da0f19f474b0ce5209a57d3cbbd241183856da0

Starting with SPY we can see that almost a months worth of gains had been wiped out within 10 days. This just goes to show what kind of market environment we are still in. SPY is currently resting on a support trendline that it has now touched 4 times. We saw a substantial increase in volume on Friday and a strong rejection from the 50 day EMA. This chart is not showing us a very bullish case at this time.

https://preview.redd.it/uvn69geun3m91.png?width=2265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22282a13ee5c598975ecb28ba36f6528c6a7c0b0

QQQ is looking much worse than SPY. Friday we opened back above the trendline but quickly fell below and came very close to undercutting the previous low. We are also now seeing a crossover of the 8 day and 50 day EMA, as well as a volume pickup as we sold off. At the moment QQQ is weaker than SPY so if you are interested in inverse ETFs it would be a good idea to look at those correlated to QQQ.

https://preview.redd.it/emlj1kjvn3m91.png?width=2264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1b9e5d8bbef444c835c8b13a7d6275fa66dfd3f

Biotechs (IBB) are still performing relatively strong, this isn‚Äôt the best chart but considering the damage done to the rest of the market it is not as bad as it could be. It would be nice to see more buying volume come in and a retake of the 50 day EMA before considering opening a position.

https://preview.redd.it/htmtb0dxn3m91.png?width=2272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=802f08bfd4050c92b1323775edc9f3def05eb199

Oil (OIL) attempted to make another run but were rejected when they approached recent highs. This could be productive if the previous lows remain intact and we don‚Äôt begin to go lower. Sideway action would allow for a longer base to form which would proved an excellent entry for a position.

https://preview.redd.it/uprfuy00o3m91.png?width=2271&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=896d821cb5ba08aade3a2f21f98b6849a21a0922

Oil services (OIH) broke out of a short base and climbed slightly before falling back into their base. We did see support on the 50 day EMA and a sharp bounce after. If we can see buying pressure come in and a break above the previous highs this may be a possible buy.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4tjaj6w1o3m91.png?width=2270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9b6980daf8abf3391af45051254c8221dbcbfb3

A 2x inverse ETF tracking QQQ, this means for every 1% decline on QQQ, this will gain 2%. We saw a good bounce off of the 50 day EMA and closed strong close to previous highs. If we break the previous high we could open a position. There is also the possibility of trading sideways for a few days to form a cup and handle pattern.

https://preview.redd.it/18ecj5z2o3m91.png?width=2277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9992e3a0fb2e9ca362f472930b521821bae2c96

SDS is similar except it tracks SPY. As we said earlier QQQ is the weaker market so that would be the ideal index to short but SPY is also setting up for a short.

https://preview.redd.it/c8huplh4o3m91.png?width=2256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f04ba0afe764c58ed08bd60cc39d871d2173abe0

Uranium (URA) had several large moves with huge volume in the past two weeks. URA could also be forming a cup and handle with a buy point of $23.80. One thing I do not like about this chart is the amount of gaps between close and open. It would be very frustrating to have a profitable position and see it go negative overnight.

https://preview.redd.it/6mnu9wu5o3m91.png?width=2243&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b8594b6f5d8d3d2a58c6f116bc9a392baa7c015

With Oil increasing it makes sense Energy (XLE) would also increase. We saw a nice bounce on the 21 day EMA Thursday and would like to see a reclaim of the 8 day EMA as well. Taking out the previous high would be a safe buy point.

Biotech, Oil, and inverse ETFs are the theme this week, they have survived (or thrived) from the recent selloff. The best strategy would be to buy the entire sector buy owning the ETF or look at the top holdings of each ETF and buy the stock with strong fundamentals and technicals.

**Bringing it all together**:

We are at a pivot point for the general market, SPY can break the support trendline and fall lower or we can consolidate and attempt to move higher. Either way there are still opportunities to capitalize. Very few sectors or individual stocks can be classified as ‚Äústrong‚Äù. If none of these setups appeal to you that is OKAY, just because the market is open for business does not mean you have to do business. The most important thing to do now is to build watchlists and maintain mental and financial capital so you are able to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves."|0.82|14|0|14

Unlike some doomsayers, I put my money where my mouth is. My portfolio is 85% short/put positions against SPY. The other 15% in long/call options in meme stocks (GME and BBBY). My portfolio is 100% options. Yes, my meme stock calls are bleeding right now, but they expire in January 2023.

I entered most of my put positions the week of August 15th where we ran up and perfectly bounced off of the daily 200 EMA (\~431.5). I deployed about 50k.

I plan on selling most of my short term dated puts (the ones that expire in 1-2 months) into CPI release on September 13th and the interest rate hike announcement on September 21st, since we might see one final bear rally hurrah before we capitulate and crash sometime in Q4 2022 or Q12023.

If we do end up rallying up throughout the rest of September and October, I'll use profits to enter new put positions that expire in March/June 2023. Entry levels would be the corridor between the 50 daily EMA and the 200 daily EMA range (maybe 405-425 depending on how big and long this rally lasts, who the fuck knows)

I started looking for a new place to live and listed my house shortly after posting that.  I'm also the guy who wrote [this DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vb7qjp/theres_going_to_be_a_global_food_shortage_heres/) about the coming food shortage.

**TL;DR Market go down, food go up, bank account go up more, buy large pizza with profits.**

Good news kids, there's no wannabe Riddler nonsense in this post, just straight answers and hard numbers, plus screenshots of my positions.  I've got five figures in already and more than twice that on the way waiting to clear settlement.

&amp;#x200B;

# First, the Market Crash

I'm going to try to keep this shorter, simpler, and more picture based than normal.  Here's the TA for the market crash, I'm going to show you the same picture twice in a row.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uizu3lilezl91.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=229b4aeda36926b5fba092bcdeb02aa69a7b2e9f

https://preview.redd.it/h271ldreezl91.jpg?width=896&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e542e2ab957901d10532ebacc6e1c4ced09903b3

I have SPY going down to 300ish within the next two months - ie by the end of October.  Resistance around 390, 385, and 360 (plus maybe 340).  Once we lose the previous low of the year at 363, it should be a skydive run down to the new Morgan Collar floor, which I think is around 300.  The century long trendline/mean reversion point is a little under 200, pretty sure that's why Burry has the final low at 184.  I've got the final low at 60-90, ([proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/salggk/behold_your_new_god_manbearape_the_vice_president/) I've been saying this for awhile) because I think we dip well below that mean/trend before recovering.

For reference, my levels for the first bottom after the peak were 350-380, then a run up to 420-450, before the real crash started (the real crash is the part we're on now).  I did not think the run down from 430 to 390 would happen as fast as it did, so I've taken a lot of 10% profits that could have gone as high as 800-900% over the last few days.  Hey, nobody's perfect, and green is green, take profits people.  I can proudly say I hit the end of day and overnight bounce from 9/1 to 9/2 and flipped back short again almost perfectly, which is incredibly rare for anyone except Domino from Deadpool or Prince from Bullet Train - and more luck than skill.

&amp;#x200B;

# Second, the Housing Crash

If you haven't read ANY of my DD's about housing and why it's in trouble, ([here's one from a year ago on why the ""not enough houses"" narrative was bogus](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/)) well, they're all on my profile, but given that you probably don't care, this post someone else made about what they'd done pretty much perfectly sums it up:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sxf16yorizl91.jpg?width=670&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bb7c5449ef9c60412525a4134b05ceb94aa8aab

Basically, Wall Street is only responsible for about 1/3rd of the ""cash buyers"" of houses you're seeing in the market.  The rest are geniuses like this guy who used margin, asset backed loans, and inflated equity values to buy property with ""cash"" and accidentally loaded up all kinds of risk that nobody picked up on.  Also see the video of the ""4880 units, Boom!"" guys.

But I mean, basically everyone has gone from calling anyone pointing out the housing bubble chicken little to saying ""yeah man, everyone knew that"", so there are any number of idiots who can provide you with info on this, though I expect it'll take a few more months before the equity linkage comes up in the mainstream press.

&amp;#x200B;

# Third, the Food Shortage

The first farm scout reports came in last week from the midwest, and they're pretty bad.  These aren't definitive numbers wise, but they're very good at identifying directionality.  Wheat, Corn, and Soybeans all came in about 4% under USDA estimates in the midwest breadbasket states.  (remember kids, this doesn't cover California, which is even more drought and heat stricken, and produces 25% of US food) Effectively this means US production can't offset the massive shortages occurring in Europe, China, South America, and India.  The situation in China is particularly brutal, they've had flooding, then went into the worst heat dome effect since the start of recorded meteorology - not a joke, 1876 is the last time things *might* have been this bad - back into what looks like a record monsoon season and more flooding.

If you want an idea of how seriously you should take the crop scout report, here's a snapshot of futures prices before and after it was released:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cm0oox95z1m91.jpg?width=1138&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b43bbea2505fe9cd64fe4a12dabd77ad1cbd2c1

https://preview.redd.it/kzpgrp74z1m91.jpg?width=1146&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d2dc55289c9e5efb0a7e20ae9f85e241d7dc7bc

Remember, it's worse in Europe, China, South America, and India and they all have significantly less resources to deal with this than the USA does.  I'm guessing the USDA only slightly revises their September yield estimates downwards, so we'll still have another downside surprise in American production when the harvest actually begins this fall.  Meanwhile, most worldwide grain production estimates I've been tracking are consistently underestimating the amount of production and distribution lost from the Ukraine war and the extreme weather from the third year of La Nina, while significantly overestimating the ability of countries like the US and Canada to make up the difference.

&amp;#x200B;

# Fourth, the Energy Shortage

Here's a fun one.  [This is the first DD I ever wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqe5mt/betting_on_oil_gas_and_economic_growth/) for WSB.  Made myself and others a very nice chunk of change on it.  It's from around 18 months ago.  You'll notice that everything I pointed out in there about lack of CAPEX in the energy sector and incompetent, belligerent relations between East and West and how that would impact energy prices has played out basically EXACTLY as I predicted, except even more to the downside because the guys who failed out of clown college are now running the circus.

I don't actually have any positions on the mess that is the global energy supply system right now, outside of a small one in Uranium (shares only) based on the theoretical hope that sanity at some point prevails.  Power use is going to drop as the summer heatwaves subside into autumn's cooler weather.  Everything with energy is just too priced in right now, except the possibility that this winter will be warmer than average.  I think we do get OPEC output cuts this fall, that will probably match up with the end of the US SPR withdrawals (remember, that's got to be built back up eventually), and I'll be looking to get in on energy around October or November, but for right now I'm not touching it.  YMMV.

The ""price cap"" idea we're seeing from G7 leaders is just a bad sketch comedy segment.  You can have price caps, or you can have supply.  You only get one, not both.  I mean, you see copium and hopium on these subs all the time (maybe my China investments will be profitable?) and other such nonsense, but the stuff the big boys pull is flat out ridic.  And to think, Putin got all of this with a small $1 million/year bribe to Gerhard Schroeder.

&amp;#x200B;

# Fifth, the next crisis, Political Unrest and Mass Migration

I said in [this DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcqov5/this_is_how_the_financial_world_ends/) a couple of months ago about how we'd see an increase in protests, riots and political unrest as a result of increasing energy and food prices, and those would be blamed on racial or social issues rather than the true causes of said unrest - inflation, wealth concentration, and shortages.  The recent mass protests in the Czech Republic, in Paris, and whatever the hell the president's ""red speech of doom"" last week was are all examples of this.  (speaking of instability, it's worth mentioning that roughly 1/3 of Pakistan is currently underwater, but its fine, that's a very stable country with good relations with its neighbors, no corruption, no relationships with terrorist organizations, and no nuclear weapons)

Look, remember the last time we had a big spike in food prices and some Tunisian fruit vendor set himself on fire starting the Arab Spring, and how like, half of Syria and the middle east walked to Europe and that just kinda fucked everything up?  Like every mass migration of people throughout the entirety of human history has?

Civilization runs on Food, Energy, and Stability.  Take the first two away and the third goes right out the window.  Things are going to get bad in the first world and flat out apocalyptic in the third.  The only thing keeping Sri Lankans on Sri Lanka right now is the ocean.  Lots of places that don't have that barrier are going to see folks walking off.

&amp;#x200B;

# Sixth, My Positions

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/podpr14hw2m91.png?width=1068&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef367a0add85a408dbf25110f9e2a87ccccc702f

I'll be adding a lot more once the rest of the money I have en route to my brokerages settles.  I also have a small shares only position in Uranium, some BBBY (I was buying shares and calls back at $4.30, and I sold some on the way up, and no, I don't think the stock with the 102% official short interest is done with volatility) and a rather silly amount of drs'd GME, including some $320/share bags that have made me incredibly strong over the last year+.

Finally, because I always, always, always get asked about this, how do I find this stuff or research plays or figure out what to invest in?

&amp;#x200B;

That's it.  That's how you do it.  You fucking look and do the research.  Good luck out there people.  Here it is, the sum of the last two years of my research and plays.  I'll keep providing updates on how this goes, profits or losses."|0.86|1393|0|1393

t3_x6mw1v|1662401175|wallstreetbets|Market Dynamics of a Squeeze|"&gt;**Disclaimer**  
&gt;  
&gt;Bylaws of Wallstreetbets specifically does not allow for ‚Äúsqueezes‚Äù that exploit market liquidity and require lots of interest just to do something. A squeeze is not far off from a pump and dump insomuch that it requires a lot of interest, and that interest will eventually subside and someone will be left holding bags. This post is not financial advice, it‚Äôs not a call to action, it is simply an opportunity to educate a good number of you who may not know what constitutes a ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù and are bag holding believing that one of these meme-stocks are going to squeeze again because of a number someone posted from Ortex that was bigger than it was yesterday.  
&gt;  
&gt;TL;DR ‚Äì Take a moment to make sure you understand how squeezes ‚Äúwork‚Äù so you can play the market rather than having the market happen around you.

Over the past few days, we‚Äôve seen a surge of posts from WSB members becoming critical of the meme-stock frenzy that has taken over the sub. The meme-stock base has responded in equal form, accusing us of being hedge funds or short funds or Citadel shills, or all sorts of accusations that are unfounded in fact or reality. Retail traders at WSB band together to do three major things:

* Learn to be better traders and share information that makes us better traders
* Celebrate our ridiculous wins and grow green with envy for not listening to the information in point 1 (gain porn)
* Laugh at our ridiculous losses and support each other after taking completely irresponsible positions because we didn‚Äôt listen to or completely misunderstood point 1 (loss porn)

The likes of Gamestop, AMC, and Bed Bath and Beyond have defied all laws of markets and have been in a perpetual state of short squeeze for 18 months and somehow will go to the moon at T+37.68 days because of RegSho or days to cover or FTD or whatever other SEC-related acronym we can put together to make it sound like an informed reason. But what makes a ticker squeeze? What creates these monumental moonshots in our stocks that leave some of us rich, some of us bagholders, and most of us yearning for our favorite tickers to swallow the sword again and amaze us all? And why do so many squeezes with big numbers from Ortex fail to materialize?

This is going to be a longform DD catered towards bullet 1 ‚Äì giving the lot of you who don‚Äôt understand the market dynamics of a squeeze an opportunity to better educate yourself on what makes a ticker squeeze. I don't want to shit on your positions that you're very well over-leveraged into, **I want you to be a better trader**.  We‚Äôll start with the sexy one that everyone loves: short squeezes. If everyone wants I‚Äôll get into Gamma Squeezes too, but the purpose of this write up is to help some of you get out of the bags you‚Äôre holding and understand what it will take to get your stock to moonshot.

# Short Squeezes ‚Äì The Hedgies are Fukt

**Basic Information on Short Squeeze Terminology**

A few terms you should all be aware of and are used an awful lot whenever ‚Äúshort interest is growing‚Äù are whispered in the halls of retail trading.

* **Short Interest** ‚Äì The number of shares short. Not much more to say than that.
* **Days to Cover** ‚Äì People like to believe that shorts have to cover in this timeframe. Make no mistake, shorts don‚Äôt *have* to cover but it is often in their best interest to do so when stock prices move in the opposite direction of what they wanted or they have secured enough profit to stop looking a gift horse in the mouth. Days to Cover basically says ‚Äúthis stock will take X days to cover a short position because there is Y short interest and has a daily average volume of Z.‚Äù Y / Z = X, and X is the days to cover. If a stock has 100 average daily volume and there are 50 shares short, 50 / 100 = .5 days to cover their short position. If there are 500 shares short, 500 / 100 = 5 days to cover.
* **Average Price Paid** ‚Äì All of the short interest together averages out to a price that short interest was entered. This is the average price of the shorts, so if 100 shares were entered at 15, 100 at 20, and 100 at 30, the average price of the short interest is $21.67. If the stock price is currently $12.00, then the shorts are considered very healthily in the money on average. There is no pressure on them to immediately cover because their positions are green. This is a very important number to monitor when looking for ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù potential.

All these numbers need to be taken together, and people in certain subs like to cherry pick data that makes a ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù look more favorable than it is. Let‚Äôs put this to practice with data from MarketWatch on the flavor of the month, BBBY:

https://preview.redd.it/73sl0rbly2m91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e48fc0067a54809d8030b192ef6c359f35f0b82

|Metric|Value|
|:-|:-|
|Short Interest|76,053,126|
|Days to Cover  (avg 3-mo volume of BBBY is 43.2M per Yahoo Finance)|1.76 Days to Cover|
|Average Price Paid (as of 9/3/22)|$4.72|

Given a market close on Friday of $8.59, we can assume that the average short on BBBY is out of the money a good deal. Given the days to cover, though, there are three courses of action a short fund could take:

1. Place limit buys on the order book to cover their short position if they really don‚Äôt think that the stock will fall much more and they have no immediate chance of being green on the position. This is a ‚Äúcover my position at a price that I determine appropriate‚Äù by using standard limit buys rather than market buys, which do not have a huge impact on the price of a stock (fairly likely)
2. Do nothing in anticipation of the stock falling more than it already is (given current news and the financial landscape of BBBY as an organization, this is the most likely)
3. Execute a whole bunch of market buys and jack up the price of the stock (this is a worst-case scenario and is the least likely for a large position to do)

Item 3 happens, has happened, and it‚Äôs what everyone hopes to happen again. But it‚Äôs important to realize that it‚Äôs one of the many tools that financial investors have at their disposal to get out of their short position. It represents the most unfavorable exit method, and you‚Äôre more likely to see a small pop on a market buy short covering than you are a moonshot unless it is also paired with gamma related market making.

**Misconceptions of the Short Squeeze**

One of the simplest things to wrap our brains around is that there‚Äôs a big number of shares short and they must cover eventually, right? RIGHT? No. Short interest does not have to cover if:

* They are okay assuming the cost to borrow and believe the stock price will return below their price paid
* They are already in the money and believe there is more downside to the stock than upside
* Their position is small enough for them to not care about holding a losing position for longer, still believing in the downside for the company

It‚Äôs important to remember that shorting a stock is a legitimate investment strategy, and the most common reason to exit a short position is a belief that the downside on a stock has been exhausted or that target profits have already been hit. Much like options traders may buy puts, stock traders will short a stock if they believe that it is a lucrative investment strategy. This isn‚Äôt a fabricated effort to keep the price down ‚Äì RegSho prohibits shorting a stock for a price beneath its last traded price, meaning that initial opening of a short position drives the price UP. It‚Äôs also why SPAC pops from gamma hedging almost always end with a whole bunch of short investors with really favorable short positions (see: GETY and many others).

**Liquidity and the Fallacy of HODL**

More and more traders are becoming passive investors with the concept of ‚Äúbuy and hold and DRS and turn off share lending‚Äù. While this hurts the ability to open new positions and to some extent close existing positions, it doesn‚Äôt do anything for the price of a stock. Given the concepts of ‚Äúdays to cover‚Äù, if the liquidity isn‚Äôt there to cover a short position, the short interest can simply wait it out and buy stocks based on standard liquidity in the order book.

Holding without actively engaging in the price setting of a stock by working with the order book is also a huge fallacy followed by those chasing the short squeeze. Remember during the Gamestop craze the WSB subreddit went nuts because a bunch of people set their sell orders to $420.69? And then the stock ran to $420.69 and beyond? This is because the price that someone was willing to sell Gamestop was known, so while there was rampant covering (and some market making, typically as the result of gamma hedging), those prices were only possible because of a few of you regards decided to sell your stock for that much.

Think of trying to resell a car. If someone wants to buy your car, asks how much you want to sell it, and you respond ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, then you‚Äôll probably never sell your car. If your neighbor has the exact same car and sells it for $69,420.00, you still say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, and your other neighbor sells for $42,069.00, you can‚Äôt really get mad when the value of your car is now $42,069.00 because you did nothing to keep the price going higher than the original $69,420.00. Remember the price of a stock is not what it‚Äôs worth, but rather the last price it traded at. It‚Äôs why those huge candles happen after hours and in the premarket ‚Äì there‚Äôs no volume to keep prices level, the order books are mostly depleted because of ‚Äúgood for day‚Äù orders.

You must actively engage with the price book to have your price known. Otherwise, you‚Äôre letting active participants around you set the price for you and that includes your much hated hedge funds and short sellers and Citadels.

**Okay so how do I make Bed, Game, and Theaters squeeze now?**

Be an active participant in trading. Sell higher than you bought, buy lower than you sold, and set your limit sells to higher than that again. Rinse and repeat until you‚Äôre happy. The only way to make the price of something go up is to set the price of that something higher than it currently is. Don‚Äôt coordinate because that‚Äôs illegal but be an active member in setting the price of the thing you love. Don‚Äôt let the market happen to you because it will win every time and you will be stuck holding some rich fuck‚Äôs bags."|0.63|8|0|8
