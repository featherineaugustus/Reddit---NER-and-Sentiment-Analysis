t3_xcven3|1663035782|options|I finally set up my strat|"after 10+ years in the market not profitable I have finally realized what I was doing wrong all this time.

I didn't actually have a system in place I would just trade on gut feelings, fundamentals and technical's, Once I invested in myself and figured out what a ""system"" is I was blown away with the results.

My system entails.

a risk to reward ratio of bet 1 to make 2.

Only trade options, the strategies I use depend on the market during that time, so for example if there was a lot of volatility because of news or other events to be scheduled in the future I would strictly use an inverse iron condor expecting a 5% move on each side etc.

My risk management was horrible before I knew what ""risk management"" actually was, So here is what works for me.

Minimum price paid for a option is $20 or 8% of capital == amount willing to lose (No need to worry about a stop loss if you already know how much you are willing to loose)

also keep a trade journal which is also an essential part of being consistently profitable.

How I handle my profits - Example $20 invested with $100 in profit:

$100 back into account.

$20 reinvested 3x

repeat with double the amount reinvested every third time to add a compounding effect.

&amp;#x200B;

The goal is to get money out of the markets while staying alive as long as possible.

I'm new to options and I want to understand their impact on stock prices. How options volume, especially volume spikes, affect stock price action

Last week, LYFT got some massive options volume end of week and started taking-off on stock. I wonder how the take-off occured and how was it caused. 

Was it the options that caused the rally? Or did the rally happened because it was a nice technical set-up or both? Or maybe someone knew it's a nice technical set-up and bought options to get people on board. I understand no one knows exactly, but in general, in practice from crowd formation this worked? and works in general. Broad brush is ok

Edit, I’ve technically been trading since 2017, but of that I’ve been trading for about 2-2.5 years due to breaks in the beginning, military deployment, initial training, etc. 

I have a normal job, but I’m an avid trader when I find an opportunity. Since may, I’ve turned $500 into $2,022 (now just under 1,700 lol) strictly following my new rules and strategy. I started a new trial account to test this strategy and it’s been working well, hopefully I can keep this up. 

On Friday, I got antsy and decided to force a trade I was very uncertain of. I put $700 into same day spy puts at the “double top” and lost, taking a bit hit. 

I doubled down and decided I would go even bigger and recoup my losses and lost again. 

Lesson relearned lol. Been a long time since I screwed myself like that. Don’t force trades, don’t get emotional and follow your rules!

t3_xc5r9e|1662965606|options|My Full Plan for this Week 09/12 (2 Earnings Plays, 1 Economic Event (CPI!!), 4 Stocks &amp; 1 Lotto 10x|"Hello ladies and gentlemen

I'm  ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I  published my Full plan and analysis. In this post, we will cover

* Last week's plays and what I learned from them
* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

Ok so let's get this show on the road

So we had 12 Plays Last Week in chronological order as they unfold

(2 No plays - 7 Wins - 3 Losses)

**$SPX dump at Open:** Went exactly as planned grabbed SPX next day puts  PM, on the pump, the market opened to a huge dump, 300%+ play.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements: -**

**$SPX relief rally:**   Also as expected after the dump, SPX bounced off  390.6 level and as   per the plan we closed my SPX Friday calls before JPow Speech at the   4000ish level, 150%+ play  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements: -**

**$DWAC**   Was a little late on this one as it was 20% down in the PM already   before open. Got in after the pop at the open, when it hit the 200MA.At   one point we were up 50%. But news came out before market close that  the  vote was delayed and the sponsor will loan them the money for an   extension causing it to pump.Luckily it lost all gains the next day PM   and i still held the puts. It pumped after they delayed the meeting   again and puts went to 0. I'm not done with this turd, will be back for   it in October for the meeting.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:**   Getting in late is one of the first obvious mistakes. Not following my   rule for selling above 50% is the second mistake. Not taking a second   chance to get out of my puts was the 3rd mistake. Will need to apply my   basic trading rules more strictly, got swept up in 10x potential.

**$SAVA** Absolute beast ran 15% from where we got in, but I got leaps so profit is nothing too crazy up 30% so far, but green is green.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** Should have added some short-term calls, as it was getting alot of traction on reddit

**$GTLB**   Beat earnings, revenue &amp; Guidance, yet still dropped in the PM. No   reasons for this to happen, but this is the nature of earnings.   Recovered by the open, but offcourse IV crush took 50% off its value.   Averaged down at the open. Then it ran, as it should have, up 8.5% where   I sold for a small 10% profit. Better than being right and selling at a   loss I guess.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:**   Should have held longer, ran up alot more for the rest of the week up   20%+ from earnings, should have placed a stop loss and let it run

**$NIO**   This was straight up a bad call, missed EPS and guidance, it ran after   market open went up 3%, sold for 20$ profit. I GOT LUCKY, this was a  bad  call.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:**   I mostly relied on sparse options flow for direction, it has a low  PPS,  likely most action would have been in shares action, not options,  which  were clearly selling off.

**$GME**   Bought puts on Tuesday, and it just kept selling off, was up 75%ish so   had to take profits. Sold and rebought with profits after it pumped a   little for earnings. Got killed on earnings puts went to zero, earnings   missed as expected but pumped on FTX partnership  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:**   Stock has lots of supporters who buy the stock on any kind of news,   puts would have worked if they were long-term, as it should dump hard if   the market goes down.

**$SPX Dump after Jpow Speech:**   We got a dump at 4017ish resistance, where i picked up puts as per  plan  BUT it very quickly rebounded and kept going up till stop loss  hit,  made 50% on this one.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \-

**$DOCU:** Not much to say here, everybody was expecting a miss, but they didn't, puts went to 0  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \-

**$KR:** Beat earnings, didn't run too much even with a bullish market, made 15%, not bad  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \-

**$MSFT $AAPL** Took no plays, no triggers activated

Ok  so now that we have last week wrapped up and behind us, This week is   going to be pretty damn exciting with CPI numbers coming out, so we have   to be prepared.

# Earnings this week that I will play

But before we go into the earnings, here is how I play earnings most of the time

How I play earnings:

* buy   shares whenever possible to avoid iv crush if you have a big account  or  the shares are cheap or buy atm options ideally 1-2 weeks before   earnings to get a cheaper premium before iv spikes
* lotto   size plays, no matter how much dd you do, things don't necessarily go   as expected. you can be right and still lose money. i personally don’t   go over 5% size on any earning’s play
* the name of the game is guidance, a company can beat eps and revenue and still tank if guidance is bad

So now that this is out of the way, let's dig into it

**Earnings**

**Monday 12 Sep 22**  
After Close - Oracle Corp. - $ORCL

* World's largest database management company
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $1.07 &amp; Revenue $11.3B
* Unusual Options: The $75.0 strike received the highest open interest with a call-put ratio of 1.37 16Sep Expiry
* Options pricing in a 6.7% move on earnings
* My   play: Not gonna lie I can't decide on this one, data/chart seems very   neutral, leaning more towards puts here, taking a very small position   here.

**Thursday 15 Sep 22**  
After Close - Adobe Inc. - $ADBE

* Packaged software company
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $3.334 &amp; Revenue $4.443B
* Unusual Options: $390.0 strike received the highest open interest with a call-put ratio of 9.93 16Sep Expiry
* Options pricing in a 7.5% move on earnings
* The stock was down 14 days in a row, before getting a dead cat bounce
* My play: 23sep 395c going with the flow here on this one, with $DOCU beat, a beat here seems likely too

So   this wraps up the earnings for this week, I bought last week this time   to avoid high premiums from IV spikes, remember lotto size only

# Major Economic Events

We   are going into CPI with a VERY interesting, very bearish SPY hourly   chart. We are right at 200MA, we have a very overbought RSI, that   remained overbought all of Friday, and we have a big gap that is yet to   be filled.

https://preview.redd.it/vwav20ngkdn91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c4095cf6a1b4abe625cacbf7e5562fcadfb1126

From   a trend point of view, we are at a very critical level. For the market   to continue its downward trend it needs to make a lower high here. If  it  breaks this level, this is no longer a relief bounce and we have a   reversal on our hands.

https://preview.redd.it/v77a5kphkdn91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e23cdfa6a5c3178cc24ea049052650aadb41a5a6

From   a technical standpoint, everything points to sell off on CPI print. If   that is the case the game plan here are some scenarios and how to play   them:

1. Good   CPI Read: We can see a sell-off all the way down to fill the gap,   cooling off the chart. Then a retest of the 200MA, trapping shorts and   triggering a squeeze. In which case our first take profit target is   401.2 at or before the gap fills on the way down.After gap fills, We   have the 21MA between the gap fill and 200MA, if it rebounds and breaks   21MA then we should switch to calls. If it fails to break 21MA and  falls  back then puts are still in play.
2. Good   CPI Read: We can see a big sell-off Monday all the way to CPI red on  Tuesday AM, to reset the charts and then pump back up. In which  case we  would just take calls after CPI read
3. Bad   CPI Read: We can see a sell-off and a hard reject off 200MA like we  did  in August and a free fall all the way to the 50MA, in that case, I   would place my stop above the gap fill level and move it down as we  keep  falling, first take profit target at 50MA

https://preview.redd.it/yfa3zooikdn91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f56ee2bd121b48d39af23652494ed158cf9da73

I   don't see a scenario where we don't dump to reset the charts at the   very least, that's why I took a starter position of Sep14 SPX 3990p on   Friday. And will be religiously taking profits and managing stop losses.

The   rest of the week is where it gets very tricky, why? These are the last  5  CPI reads and what happened afterApr. 12, 2022 (Tues) -  Dumped on  CPI  read day and Dumped the next week

May 11, 2022 (Wed) - Dumped on CPI read day and Pumped for the rest of the week

Jun. 10, 2022 (Fri) -  Dumped on CPI read day and Dumped the next week

Jul. 13, 2022 (Wed) - Dumped on CPI read day and Pumped for the rest of the week

Aug. 10, 2022 (Wed) - Pumped on CPI read day and pumped for the rest of the week

As   you can see the data is very inconclusive, as matter of fact it seems   to be alternating every month, so if this trend continues we should   reverse whatever happens on the CPI read day, for the rest week.   Offcourse this is not reliable so we won't be looking at that for   direction.

Luckily since we are at   pivotal levels, I expect an overall follow-through, last 2 CPI reads   showed inflation decreasing, we are actually expecting, deflation for   august at -0.01% read and the headline read of 8.1%.

https://preview.redd.it/jgvciikjkdn91.jpg?width=962&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1219e57098d98c2fdcb37bad48be57eccb2b0c97

At   or below these levels and 75bps is off the table completely which is   what the market has already priced in. Not only will we pump this week,   but we will also probably pump for the rest of Q4 22, as fed pivots in   Q1 23. If you see these numbers or below, you might want to get  yourself  some calls, cause we are pumping hard.

If you see anything above these numbers prepare yourself for a new low this year and load up on puts. We have:

**Tuesday 09/13**

08:30 AM CPI/Inflation Rate Aug

**Wednesday 09/14**

08:30 AM PPI Aug

**Thursday 09/15**

08:30 AM Retail Sales MoM Aug0  
8:30 AM Initial Jobless Claims MoM Aug

**Friday 09/16**

10:00 AM Michigan Consumer Sentiment Sep

I'm leaning towards a drop and pump but no need to guess here, we have our levels and plays ready.

# Watchlist

**$NVDA**   has a small gap to fill up to $149.8, if the market continues its run   on Monday this gap could fill and would take Calls at open if the  market  is bullish.

https://preview.redd.it/7arusl3lkdn91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=185f64202e0bfadc42e9f0880702c25c048acf95

**$TSLA**   has been going sideways for a while now and we are at a pivotal level,   should make a big move whichever way the market breaks, if sentiment  is  bullish and we can break $315 expect a move to $364 quickly. If the   market is bearish, we go back quickly to 50MA, lose that and $207 is my   next target

https://preview.redd.it/wycmm5ylkdn91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d622586bdd7dce825cced70259796ccd455bfe6a

**$UPST**   is another gap fill play to $30, that's a 15% move from current  prices.  Same-week calls would print hard if the market is bullish

https://preview.redd.it/w2cvf9rmkdn91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64a32b94674b9caf3c0a3e7671d5ad28965dd1fd

**$QQQ**   if the market trend is bearish after CPI while everything will fall,   the biggest losers will be tech stocks. I will be loading QQQ puts here   if the market sentiment is bearish

https://preview.redd.it/xmhcc0unkdn91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18d25893dc2439a500174e3891450c52efe15dca

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

**$NFLX -**   This play is only valid if the market trend is bullish, we have a $100   gap to fill from here. We have been channeling between $217 and $249  for  the last 2 months, sooner or later this gap will fill. Once we  break  out of the channel, the gap could fill in 2-3 days. We have 2  scenarios  for when the gap would fill, but both would require the  market trend to  be bullish.

https://preview.redd.it/5zw0xa2pkdn91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84bc75559b88c0a39769a9abe6d18497b0422bc3

1. The market is bullish starting at CPI all the way through FOMC, we can see the gap fill
2. We get great earnings on 17Oct and gap fills

In   all cases looking at the chart, this gap is begging to get filled.  This  is a 10+-bagger opportunity, but market conditions will dictate  the  timing of the play.  If we dump on CPI we can revisit the play in   October.

If the market is bullish,  im getting Oct28 260c and Sep30 245c, even if doesn't gap fill, big   market run should push NFLX up alot. Risk to Reward is excellent on this   play, as long as it fulfils our criteria.

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going   through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, non of this financial advice.

I wish you all a very green week!"|0.91|105|0|105
t3_xc2s0p|1662955418|options|Seeking input on how to play FSR going into production in November.|"I have a thesis that the price of FSR is going to rise (slow/choppy) from its current lows over the next three months as production approaches in Nov. 

I currently have a variety of simple calls/leaps based on this, but am seeking input on more elegant/creative strategies to play this kind of price move. Not here to debate the company/thesis, just how you'd play this kind of expected price action.

As an example, let's assume I have the following approximate price targets:

9/30 $10-11
10/21 $12-14
11/18 $14-17 (*scheduled production start*)

Calendar? Diagonal? Vertical? Something else? I'm a bit new to multileg, but have been studying and (think I) know my way around the basics.

Fpr example, I'm currently looking at an $11 calendar for 9/30-10/21, with the hope/belief that the Sept expire and the Oct go ITM. 

Any ideas or input is appreciated!"|0.84|4|0|4
t3_xc1gj5|1662951372|options|Trading Frequency &amp; A Better Approach|"Early in my trading, like most options traders, I became infatuated. I started trading ALL the time, lamenting the PDT rule, trying a bunch of different strategies with different variations. Looking back at this time, I wasted it. I'll layout how I would've approach this differently to actually maximize the value of the experience.

1. **Write out the strategies.** I was trading what I saw, heard, felt, etc. I was NOT trading anything that I had taken the time to sketch out and create a plan for. This led to a complete inability to pragmatically observe cause and effect of what I was doing and any ability to optimize.
2. **Create a log to track what I was doing.** Seemed like a lot of work and I obviously could remember what I was doing and if I needed to, just look back at my broker statements - right? Wrong! This was ignorant and lazy. Not only wasn't I trading a defined approach, I wasn't even tracking anything to compare. Looking back I want to ask myself, what was it that I sincerely thought I was going to accomplish. Once I created a log, to track how I was assessing entry criteria, selecting strikes, deltas, risk management, profit management, etc. I was able to actually create usable data to optimize.
3. **I Started Making More Money, When I Traded Less**. A huge outcome of implementing #1 and #2 is #3. I found that I was attempting to trade shorter DTE (not the 0DTE stuff we see today, but mostly 4-11DTE). What I learned was forcing my timeframe that I was comfortable with regardless of what the market, simply led to me handing away any semblance of edge in the strategy. I started more clearly defining the criteria I needed for my shorter-term strategies and something magical happened. The ""ideal"" trading opportunities plummeted and I wasn't trading the strategy each week no matter what. This actually increased the expectancy of the strategy but more importantly, got me to spread into other strategies - which ultimately worked far more effectively for me. I dove into ratio diagonals, ratio covered strangles, volatility strategies (long/short straddles) etc.

Hope some of these thoughts help others as they tighten up their trading game. I've been at it for 15 years now and continually trying to get better. Have an awesome week!"|0.64|8|0|8

t3_xbvicc|1662934673|options|Expected moves this week: SPY QQQ Tesla Adobe Oracle|"### The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** The SPY rallied 3.6% last week, more than making up for the prior week’s 3.1% decline. Options were only pricing a 2% move, so that’s several weeks in a row where options have been underpricing market moves.

**This Week –** SPY options are again pricing a 2% move for the upcoming week.

**Implied Volatility / VIX –** After 2 weeks near 26, the VIX declined to close last week, under 23.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **2%** (+/- $8)
* QQQ **2.6%** (+/- $8)
* IWM **2.4%** (+/- $4.50)
* DIA **1.7%** (+/- $5.50)

## In the News

Last we checked in on Tesla (TSLA) in this space was with the stock heading into its 3-for-1 stock split. At the time the stock was about $295 split-adjusted and options were pricing an expected move was about 11% for the next month and a year-end expected move of about 25%. The stock did indeed move lower by about 11% but has now rallied right back, essentially now unchanged since its split and near $300.

As we’ve mentioned numerous times, TSLA stock has tended to make quick moves that far outpace option pricing, both higher and lower in the stock, over the past year. But splits can sometimes affect a stock’s volatility. Since the split, TSLA stock moves have been fairly muted, albeit with a very small sample set. Here’s the pricing going forward, with the options market pricing about a 10% move for the next month, and about a 20% move into year-end:

1. Straight Puts/Calls
2. Debit Spreads
3. Credit Spreads

I couldn't help but wonder if the following is true, so please help me:

* Buying *puts* is better than calls - IV goes up if you're right and you are *bearish*
* Buying *puts debit* is better than buying calls debit - same reason as above
* Selling puts spread is better than selling calls spread - IV drops if you're right and you are *bullish*

To put it simply, if you are bearish or bullish, your option strategies should revolve around puts and not calls. You want IV to drop when you are bullish (selling put credit spread) and you want IV to increase when you are bearish (buying put debit spread or just straight puts).

t3_xbflum|1662893844|options|Consistent returns and manageable risk of SPX credit spreads/short condors in current environment.|"Last week I sold weekly SPX IC 15-wide with 0.3 delta on short legs for ~1k max profit and ~1k max loss. SPX was ~4040 when I opened the contract. Entire week SPX was below my short put leg but I managed to close IC on Friday morning bump securing total 650 profit right before SPX dived below 3900.
This week I decided to widen short legs to 0.2 delta by being scared of unusual(?) volatility SPX had last week. So opened 3775/3790 3990/4005 IC on Tuesday when SPX was I believe around 3890. Max profit 500, max loss 1000. SPX printed 4.5% gains this week leaving my IC short call leg far below its closing price, and leaving me with no option to close contract somewhere in the middle of the week due to high IV and gamma on my legs.
So the question is: was it just a rare instance of the blind luck securing 650 profits on the previous week and I should stay away from SPX spreads/condors given the violent move SPX had this week? Or should I tweak delta on short legs to say 0.15 (I would still suffer with a 0.15 delta this week)?"|0.6|1|0|1

With sites like Optionstrat (even Fidelity can do this), you can project the pricing of any option through its lifetime and underlying price movements. 

What I don’t understand is why these prices are generally pretty inaccurate from day to day? This really matters for things like calendar spreads, when the projection is that you could get a pretty decent profit on neutral movement, but in reality you get very very little profit if at all. This happens with very well characterized/high volume underlyings like SPY. My goal is to make theta work in my favor, so that’s why I’m focused on strategies like calendars. 

My impression is that Vega is affecting the pricing (meaning changes in IV) but the option price itself seems to have moved too much for it to make sense. I’ve screenshotted options contract price for each leg on the day before and the projected price on the day after and it’s usually completely wrong.

t3_xa9vkj|1662766178|options|Biopharmaceutical Catalyst Options strategy|"I saw a YouTube video where a guy shorted a small-cap biopharmaceutical company right before it had its stage 3 trial results released. His basis of reason was that a majority of small-cap pharmaceutical companies have a lot of funding and a lot of potential but usually fall short of creating a drug that is efficacious enough to actually be released in the market. For example, the company he shorted was creating a pill that blocks serotonin receptors to decrease the desire to drink alcohol in heavy drinkers. The trials showed that the pill indeed did decrease the consumption of alcohol but also had a series of hormonal side effects that come with blocking serotonin reception in the brain. So even though the drug worked it was not good enough to be a treatment and the stock plummeted netting him a very hefty profit

He used [https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/](https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/) to identify and obtain DD on pharmaceutical companies with upcoming catalysts.  This website not only provides the date of when the trial results will be released but also the results of previous trials and about everything you need to know about that company. You can use it for free but it will only show you catalysts a few days ahead of time which isn't enough to track companies through their trials and do proper DD. There is a 1-month free subscription but after that, it is 5 dollars a month which is very cheap for such exclusive and powerful information.

The fundamental logic of the strategy is solid. Small cap biopharmaceutical companies do not make it through the FDA dramatically more often than not and stage 3 trial results are usually a letdown. That is our edge. We focus on stage 3 trial results because stage 3 trials appear to be the most important stage in finding out whether or not a drug works and is marketable. We focus on small-cap companies because they usually have a lot more riding on a single drug compared to a large-cap or mid-cap biopharmaceutical company. A large company worth tens of billions usually has multiple drugs being developed at once and more resources which equals a higher chance of success. In the event of a failed drug for a large cap, the overall effect on the company will not be that large, however, in the event of a failed drug in a small cap where it is the only drug or 1 out of 3 drugs being developed, it is a devastating loss. This devastating loss is what causes the large 40%+ downside movements. 

Now that we have established a fundamental concept and edge we have to look at position sizing and risk management to have a profitable strategy. The problem with shorting shares is that we have limited downside potential(100%) and unlimited upside potential. While you might make 50% on 8/10 of the companies you short, you will lose well over 100% on the 2/10. This will not only wipe out your gains but most likely put you in the hole since successful biopharmaceutical companies have been known to exceed 1000% upsides if their drug is approved or effective. The solution to this is options. We can create defined risk put debit spreads. This gives you a defined upside and a defined downside. The risk vs reward ratio can be determined by adjusting how far OTM you buy your spread. If you buy the spread ATM or slightly OTM you will be looking at a 1:1 risk to reward. If you go 20% OTM you'll look at a 1:3 risk to reward. If you go 40% OTM you'll usually see a 6-10:1 risk to reward. This is based on a 7-DTE spread. 

Theoretically, if we purchased 10-15% OTM put debit spreads for a 2:1 risk to reward and 6/10 of our picks did not pass trials we are looking at 800$ of net profit if we bet 100$ each time. 

However, there is a problem because not all small-cap biopharmaceutical companies have options chains. Unfortunately, we can't do anything about this and will have to pass them by unless you are willing to get OTC(over-the-counter) options. I have not messed with OTC options so I cannot comment on them.  The other problem is that the small-caps that do have option chains usually have very low liquidity and very few strikes to choose from. This means that you will usually have to hold your spread till expiration and have the buying power to let them be exercised or the closest to the money spread that you can purchase is too far out of the money to be in accordance with what will give you a reasonably high chance of success. The solution to the latter problem is a ZEBRA or zero extrinsic value back ratio spread. Here is a link to explain it in depth ([https://www.tastytrade.com/concepts-strategies/zebra](https://www.tastytrade.com/concepts-strategies/zebra)). The Zebra allows you to mimic owning 100 shares of stock for approximately 50% of the cost and removes all extrinsic value from the spread. This gives you a built-in stop loss at 50% of what it cost to own 100 shares of the stock and for every 1 dollar the stock goes up you will make 100 dollars. While this spread requires a larger financial commitment it can be done on basically any options chain and you can sell for max profit at any time. You do not have to wait until expiration, unlike a debit spread.

This is all I have put together for this strategy so far. I am excited to test it out. I am not experienced or knowledgeable in the biopharmaceutical sector whatsoever so I wanted to share the information I've collected and ask this subreddit if they have any insights they could share with me. Most specifically what catalysts are most important to look at? While stage 3 trials are pivotal I am curious if anyone knows if there was a better catalyst to be against on aside from stage 3.

At the bottom when they were only worth around $0.30 - 0.35, I sold those and bought 17x 7.5c for the same date in January, which were worth about $0.55. 

Overall I lost out on the number of options that I had, buuut I have a closer strike price (even though I actually still believe I might reach the $9 goal regardless by the new year). 

My questions are, 

1) is there a name for this other than ""same date rolling"" or something?

2) is this even smart or did I actually lose money overall this way, if I truly do believe in the stock and think it might recover all the way back to my original $9 strike? Or is it smarter to just continue to DCA the same option price if I believe in the stock

3) Is there any math/research that I can do in the future to tell me when is the optimal time to ""roll"" these to a nearer strike, or like a trigger I should look for to do it"|0.75|2|0|2

I’ve been learning about the wheel strategy. I want to get some feedback, advice, etc.

My general strategy for investing is slow and small until I get the hang of it. So my plan with the wheel is to sell 1 contract at a time with a relatively inexpensive value/dividend ETF. Im seeing a couple risky situations on the call side and not really anything on the put side.

On the call side, obviously I loose on asset  appreciation if there’s a big upswing. But if there is a big downswing, there’s a chance I won’t be able to sell a call because I won’t select a strike price below my cost basis. So no one will want to buy the contract and I'll be stuck with the shares until the market recovers enough.  Not terrible since I picked something I want to hold long term anyway. 

On the put side, all I see is the chance that I'll have to deposit more money to my brokerage to cover the put. No biggie. Am I missing anything on the put side?

&gt;\[R\]etail traders seek options expecting spikes in volatility and, for that reason, incline toward firms with more media coverage. Furthermore, their trading increases around the time of firms’ earnings announcements. Thus, the authors examined the connection between retail option demand and expected announcement volatility (EAV). They found that retail traders seem unwilling to close their option positions following high EAV earnings announcements, which increases their losses. However, bidding up option prices is the main reason for retail losses, supported by enormous bid-ask spreads in options ahead of high EAV announcements. On the other hand, market makers make up another active group around earnings announcements, offsetting retail investors’ positions. As a result, market makers benefit from the behavior mentioned above, which causes a large flow of money from retail to market makers.

t3_x7p4xf|1662506625|options|Question on Bull Put Spreads|"Afternoon,

I have been using cash secure put (CSP) positions over the last 6 months, and happy with the results (~2% weekly profit on capital).  That said, I'm also looking at Bull Put Spreads for several reasons: A) they produce a net credit; B) have lower margin (encumbered capital) requirements, thus a larger profit on the margin used; c) somewhat similar to CSPs.

Today, I took a Bull Put Spread (BPS) position - in the traditional sense, long leg OTM with the short leg ITM, and it will probably do ok.  It's an experiment. 

In watching the legs of the traditional BPS perform, to me - it appears that the short ITM leg tends to be a ""drag"" on the position.  That observation - leads me to wonder about pulling both legs at setup to be OTM.

The specific question I have is about a BPS position constructed in a non-traditional way - **where both legs are OTM**.  I believe I see a couple of benefits to this as A) an increased chance of profit;  B) an apparent skew of the profit curve to what I perceive to be in my favor;  C) a decrease in net credit - but a reasonable credit non the less, but still about a potential profit of 20% on margin;  D) a decrease in the margin (encumbered capital) requirements.

I'm more than willing to take a smaller net credit, with an increase in the chance of a profit, while initiating the position where I would place the short-leg OTM - with the underlying security in an uptrend.  If the underlying security was in a strong uptrend - then yes, I can see using the long leg OTMs and the short leg ITM, so as to capture an overall larger net credit.  If I use just the short-leg OTM as a CSP position, I'd be taking about a 3% potential profit.  However, with the same setup (lower margin) as a BPS has a potential 20% profit (even at 1/2 with an early close, may yield on the order of 10% profit).

I've done a screen capture of the BPS position in the link below.

For example, it costs $700 to create an IC with $120 max profit and $200 max loss and with breakevens of &gt;2% on either side as on date.

I'm trading options in a developing country's market and this was possible all through 2021 with an 84% win rate and ~250% ROI. Held every single position till expiry (cash settled)

My understanding is that this was possible only because of the risk reward profile along with the high probability of profit that comes with +/-2% breakeven distance
Was this kind of profile a once in a lifetime situation or are these kind of iron condors possible consistently in the US markets/elsewhere? I'm only asking about the profile of iron condors, the returns are obviously not possible on a consistent basis

is it reasonable to sell cash secured puts with high premium yet long months ( 4-6 months) to make sure if I got assigned I get assigned for prices I want to pay or that would be a waste taking in considering the 45d rule of optimum gains and best use of time depreciation ?

Editing after replies

I would pay less price for the share on longer period  4months (if I got assigned) so I'd get better price for share than if I went with 45d for example as I got higher premium. 

Unless I successfully sell 3-4 puts of 30-45 days and the market helped me not to get assigned then that would be the only scenario I have lost the better premium of shorter period. but that is less safe or more risky strategy. am I missing something ?! 

the compromise between the price I'll to get the stock at and higher premium and the best possible out come of decay on 45d puts contain a risk/reward sacrifice as I see it."|0.77|20|0|20

If I'm bearish on a high IV stock which I currently do not own, but would like to profit from the high IV/selling options, I'd sell calls. But selling naked calls is risk undefined and not my cup of tea.
What i was thinking about is selling a OTM call 45 DTE with lets say delta = 0.50 and hedging against it by buying 50 shares. 

The idea behind it would be to go short on IV and somewhat directional.

Can anybody tell me if thats a smart way to short IV on a stock that one is generally bearish on?

Of course theres always gamma risk and to be truly delta neutral would need constant rebalancing. Since I pay high fees on stocks but not on options, i could also theoreticly roll up/down my strikes instead of buying small amounts of shares.

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, and my analysis usually does fairly well (check my post history for proof)

I'm starting a thing where I post weekly my analysis and plays for the upcoming week, I will be going through my plays for:

1. Earnings
2. Major Economic Events
3. My Watchlist
4. My Week lotto 10 bagger Play

There  is also a video on my channel (link in my profile) going through all  this, so you can check that out if you dont like reading

Ok so let's get this show on the road

**Earnings this week that I will play**

But before we go into the earnings, here is how I play earnings most of the time

How i play earnings:

* buy  shares whenever possible to avoid iv crush if you have a big account or  the shares are cheap or buy atm options ideally 1-2 weeks before  earnings to get a cheaper premium before iv spikes
* lotto  size plays, no matter how much dd you do, things don't necessarily go  as expected. you can be right and still lose money. i personally don’t  go over 5% size on any earning’s play
* the name of the game is guidance, a company can beat eps and revenue and still tank if guidance is bad

So now that this is out of the way, let's dig into it

**Tuesday 6 Sep 22**

After Close - GitLabs - $GTLB

* DevOps software company
* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS ($0.23) &amp; Revenue $94m
* Unusual Options: trade of 2500 $75c 12/10 in August nothing notable recently
* Options pricing in a 16% move on earnings
* $JPM downgrade knocked it down 18%, could be dropped to grab shares before a great earnings call, or could be something else.
* 6 months+ after lock-up expiration, insiders of $GTLB only sold 288.5k shares (\~0.2% of total outstanding shares)
* My play: 09sep 49c it has massive potential to run if they beat, going with calls flow looks pretty bullish

**Wednesday 7 Sep 22**

Before Open - NIO inc - $NIO:

* EV car manufacturer
* Estimate Earnings Time: 6:00 am EST
* Estimate eps ($0.17) &amp; revenue $1.45b
* Unusual Options: trade of 9000 19c 09/09 expiry, on Friday.
* Options pricing in a 10% move on earnings
* On the latest delivery report, $NIO delivered 10,677 vehicles in August 2022, an increase of 81.6% YoY
* They won't be affected by the chip ban, and are no longer in danger of delisting
* My Play: $18c 9 Sep, following the options flow on this one, I think guidance will be good on this one

After Close - Gamestop - $GME

* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS ($0.41) &amp; Revenue $1.27B
* Unusual Options: trade of 7600 $20p 09/16 expiry in aug but nothing recent yet.
* Options pricing in a 15.0% move on earnings
* NFT  marketplace not making money, no major games or studio deals last  quarter, consoles sales slightly declining and Ryan Cohen screwed folks  on $BBBY
* My Play: $24p 09sep, don't see how this one doesn't miss

**Thursday 8 Sep 22**

After Close - Docusign - $DOCU

* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.42 &amp; Revenue $602m
* Unusual option: trade of  $65p 16/12 worth $3,792,570 on Friday
* Options pricing in a 19.8% move on earnings
* Charts and options chains are screaming bearish on this one massive put block getting bought last week
* My Play: $53p 09 Sep, gonna go with the flow here

**Friday 9 Sep 22**

Before Open - Kroger - $KR

* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.42 &amp; Revenue $602m
* Unusual Option: trade of  $48p 09/09 worth $577,500 on Friday
* Options pricing in a 7% move on earnings
* My Play: $49c 09sep, $WMT, and $HD beat, I'm going against the flow here and going for calls following them

So  this wraps up the earnings for this week, I should have bought last  week to avoid high premiums from iv spikes, so I'm going to place all my  calls and puts on Tuesday at the open, remember lotto size only

**Major Economic events this week**

https://preview.redd.it/bqjdjjif04m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3aa440a8c327e58887e2d1d141bab0767b35b55

So  overall expectations are a relief rally this week all the way to JPow  speech at somewhere between $4017 which is major resistance and 50MA on  the daily and$ 4120 level which is another major resistance and 21MA on  $SPX and then the start of a major meltdown after that. so we have

Tuesday

10:00 am - Non-manufacturing PMI aug

Wednesday8:30 am - Balance of trade July

12:35 - Fed Brainard's speech

Thursday8:30 am - Initial jobless claims9:10 - 9:50 am - Fed Jerome Powell's speech

Friday

10:00 am - Wholesale Inventories

12:30 - Fed Walker Speech

As  far as the short-term market reaction is concerned, which is what we  are interested in now, most of these are all nonevents, with the  exception of JPow speech and PMI read. they are all critical for the  overall picture but the idea is to play these events.

Market  reaction to numbers has been mixed. market dumps on good numbers and  pumps on bad ones. i believe that the market basically uses these events  to run or dump based on what the charts give us. going with that  theory, my plays will be as follows:I'm expecting a continuation of  the Friday dump premarket so I will take SPX puts when pm opens, target  is 3860 or before PMI whichever comes first.Before PMI I expect a  relief rally all the way into the JPow speech on Thursday, i'm not sure  whether the market collapse starts at the JPow speech or CPI numbers on  the 13th. My targets for SPX calls are $4017 and $4120. so I will be  getting out of calls at these targets or before JPow speech whichever  comes first.My expectations are based on the chart levels below, the  market pumped on shit numbers and dumped on great numbers, the only  thing that has been consistent is the chart, they just tack on an excuse  for why the stock moved the way they wanted it to.

**Watchlist for this week**

* $ETH  has been channeling between $1700 and $1420 for the past week, I will  looking for a break of the channel either way for the position, till  that happens we can scalp within the range.

https://preview.redd.it/604ru4hg04m91.png?width=1834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f6e9e87326dd21d474096de1711815ff8023442

* $MSFT  wins a $22B AR headset contract with the US army, I expect some more  pain in the market followed by a proper relief rally, $MSFT should run  hard on this news during the rally. I will take calls then, my target  would be the retest of the 50MA at $270.4, if the market tanks I'm  looking at $245 support as my first target

https://preview.redd.it/ieni1q8h04m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85453d8dbdac1b28296d4df076c3fa67d3ab835d

* $AAPL  event starts on Wednesday, expected to reveal iPhone 14 among other  things, could see a run, if the market runs. we are currently right at  the 50MA on the daily and $155.6 support. if the market runs target is  $166.5 which is the 21MA, and if it tanks we will see $130 quickly

https://preview.redd.it/ij6qhjzh04m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fb51178430044fc682960729dc1e04c3cbcc0d8

* $SAVA  3M in insider buys last month by directors and the chief medical  officer, if someone knows something about whether they pass the trials  or not, it would be this guy. more importantly, insiders sell for many  reasons but buy only for one, they think the stock will go up. low float  37M and 33% of float shorted, ran to $140 last year.

https://preview.redd.it/syeuqopi04m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9038e92159a29baa9cc51e993dcde163eaa636de

Taking  ATM calls here for Jan20 23 might wait for a drop to $15.4 support  before an entry, but we are at 50MA on the daily, so might take a  starter there. if phase 2 final data is positive, we can expect to hit  $65 resistance at least, phase 3 data may be available in early 2023.  I'm taking my time with entries here and may go for a longer expiry.

So  if you made it this far, I'm guessing this is what have been waiting  for, this is largely under the radar, but could play out Tuesday, and  book us a big win!

**Possible 10 bagger play for this week**

So  the $DWAC deadline to merge with truth social is Tuesday 09/06, if that  doesn't happen, which thanks to the SEC investigation it won't, the  stock dumps back to SPAC floor prices which is $10.

Now  the reason it's not already there, is that they have shareholder vote  for an extension after market close, but they need 65% approval to get a  6-month extension. with most people unaware of this, it seems unlikely  it will happen.

Not only that they  also have to put up $6m or $0.10 per share as collateral to get the  extension, which they don't get back if the merger doesn't go through.  we all know for political reasons will not go through in 6 months or  even a year.

So my play here is  $25p 9 Sep here, my thinking is that it won't pass. if it tanks to $10,  this could be a 10-bagger right there!

As  an important side note, please don't buy $10 puts, the floor price is  $10, and they will go to 0, even if the stock tanks to $10 because it  can't go below $10 (for the most part) so the market will price them as  worthless.

Alright, so that's it  for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the  previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing a 2% move for the upcoming (4-day) week.

**Implied Volatility / VIX –** The VIX closed the week near 26, unchanged on the week. Volatility may have been higher if not for having to price in a 3-day weekend.

## In the News

Although somewhat expected, gas supplies to Europe were cut off this weekend by Russia. As US markets were closed for the long weekend, European stocks opened lower on Monday as well as a lower Euro, with energy prices trading higher. Equities finished higher than their opening reaction lows of the day.

VGK (European stock ETF) options are pricing about a 10-11% move into year-end, slightly more of a move than SPY options are pricing (9%).

t3_x6nf37|1662402475|options|Unusual Options Activity on Cameco Corp (CCJ): Sense or Nonsense?|"An article was published yesterday on Barchat about ""Investors buying a ton of call options in Cameco Corp (uranium stock)"".Cameco Corporation (CCJ) is the supposedly the world's largest publicly traded company, and it is based in Saskatchewan, Canada.

The rational behind this is Russia recently turning off the tap of natural gas supplies to Europe. The reaction, then, of the affected European governments is a ""sudden interest"" in nuclear power. Take for example, *France's Electricite de France (EDF)* just announced its commitment to restarting all its nuclear power reactors by winter. The expectation is that other European countries like Germany may follow suit and as you may have already seen or heard of the planned protests in Berlin and Leipzig.

Most of the calls purchased are out-of-the-money (OTM) calls with strikes 31 &amp; 37. (A) The 31Call has a total volume of 22,774 and with the avg. price/contract at $3.00, this amounts to $6.83 million total investment.(B) 37Call --&gt; 22,667Vol x 1.40 avg. price/contract --&gt; $3.173 Million investment

The stock is currently at $28.82 which is already a 15% in the prior month. From (A) above, investors expect CCJ to rise 7.6% more than its current price.From (B) above, investors expect CCJ to rise 28.4% more than its current price.

# The financials and fundamentals:

The stock is said to have a high valuation. Well, even a quick look at the P/E ratio makes one quite uncomfortable like swimming on a cold lake. The *P/E ratio is 235.07* as per Market Watch. *For the quarter ended June 2022, they reported a total revenue of CAD $557.58M, net income = CAD$83.98M, and diluted EPS = CAD$0.21.*

Though, analysts forecast EPS of up to 1.05$ next year 2023, EPS could be $0.75 as some other analysts propose. At 1.05$, this is roughly 27x the current stock price. The problem, it seems, is that investors are expecting 43x earnings (anywhere from $45 - $50) at the $37 strike which has 22,667Vol and a $3.173 Mil investment.

The author of this article even goes ahead to point out that this play is some ""sort of greater fool theory"" play

**Can anyone speak to the validity of this buying interest? As an aside, another interesting unusual options flow are AEO puts, AMC puts and TWTR calls - trying to make sense of those ones too.**

For each stock, the position on the y axis is the implied move from options pricing: looking at ATM closest expiration straddle (call and put closest to the stock price, ideally delta neutral) breakeven. Breakeven is the amount of absolute move, in either direction, of the stock price needed for the position to be worth its initial price.

https://preview.redd.it/ftjwm843pyl91.png?width=1847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18cc0bbeeb71d774a22c644ab02cf3965a5fcdb2

# 

# 

# Implied vs Historic Pricing

The x axis is showing the average historic move for the stock on all past releases: that's the mean of the the highest / lowest variation of the stock the day after release. This is based on historic data. The y axis is based on current options pricing - the implied move. The upper part of the graph (above the y=x middle line) are stocks where the implied is higher than the past average - expectations are higher than what happened in the past. And vice versa for the lower part and undervalued

# 

# Past Moves Distribution by Sector

Each graph is a histogram: x axis are values of moves (absolute move, in any direction, happening the day of release) and y axis is the occurrence of that move (in percentage) - the peak is the move that happened the most historically and the shape of the curve shows how these past moves are distributed. The dashed line is the classic implied move from ATM options pricing.

If IV is low in a market and the FED is anticipating a 100 bps hike over the course of the next 6 months, is it true to say that if the IV for that market is around 30%, then the market is not properly pricing the anticipated bps spike and provides an opportunity to go long on low volatility?

What is a better time to set up PMCC, assuming you know if the price is generally going to dip or rise soon?

Let’s say my technicals tell me a stock is going up soon. Do I set up PMCC now, so that I bought my LEAP call at a good price? But yet that also means I sold the short call for a lower price, isn’t it?

Or if my technicals tell me a stock is going down soon. If I set up PMCC now, I would have sold the short call at a good price than if I sold it after the stock’s drops. But that also mean I bought the LEAP at a higher price, than if I were to buy it after the stock’s price drops, isn’t it?

t3_x5a6ge|1662254240|options|Most accurate option paper trading platform?|"Hello I am wondering if someone can guide me in option paper trading. 

I have been working on some strategy, namely Iron Condor, and I learned that there is huge difference between live account and paper trading account in thinkorswim, where fills are not occurring in the live account while paper trading has no problem to get filled even when every thing is exactly the same conditions (i.e: same delta, same strike prices, same premium, even the time at which the place was ordered by using one in my mobile and another in my computer). 

My theory on this is that paper trading is all about theory, where if there is just one available at the time when the order was submitted, then that order could be possible, and therefore paper trading does possibly occur, but in reality, that's not the case due to liquidity, and people waiting in line. 

So I am wondering if there are other platforms than ThinkorSwim to simulate the strategy before my live account starts to go and test, and I would gladly appreciate comments I can get some insightful information in regards to this issue

An idea that i came up with is to buy an at the money calendar spread which is a neutral strategy, and buy an out of the money strangle that's cheaper than the debit paid on the calendar spread that way if the underline moves significantly to one side or the other it would offset your loss on your calendar spread. And vice versa if the stock doesn't move much then maybe your calendar spread could offset your loss on your strangle. So basically you'd be making friends with both theta and Vega.

What if you own 500 shares of a stock that is currently worth $0.20 a share ($100 dollars value), the short interest is relevantly high therefore puts must be valuable.

Now that I have 500 shares, I can sell 5 puts at $6.90 for a credit of $3,450. Max loss would be $300 for the option, I don't care if I hit max loss as I will still have turned $100 into $3,150.

Okey so recently tried to do a small swing trade just before Jerome Powell's speech last Friday... bad move... Here I am with 60 shares of $RUN at avg. price of $34.54. Now it's all cash so I don't have to worry about holding onto these, but I recently thought if I can hedge this by CC writing.   


prices for the example are at the close of today's market, but it's ONLY an example so it should work.

Let's say I decide to buy additional 40 shares for $31.3. That's now $3324 in stocks.   
I write September 16th Calls for a strike price of 35 for a .73 premium.   


1. I get $73 in premium plus the possibility that the stocks will get called for a whole $3500. In this scenario the overal income is 248.6
2. I get $73 but the stock price doesn't go up enough for the stocks to be called away. I hold the stocks and either sell them whenever I can or write another CC after September 16th
3. I get $73 but the stock price goes down. At this point I'm 40 more shares into this bad boy so even though I gained some I'm also losing overall.  


Am I getting this whole CC writing right?"|0.6|2|0|2

Since I haven't been assigned, there's no real cost basis yet that I have to worry about managing. The only real risk that I see is a black swan event where the underlying drops too far too fast to keep the puts in a decently profitable range. 

I could very well be wrong, but it seems like a relatively safe way to keep making a bit of money rather than park everything in cash as some have suggested during these turbulent times."|0.75|15|0|15
t3_x46ap6|1662137105|options|PSNY CSP - dumb or reasonable?|"Hey guys :)

This would be my first options trade after months of stock trading and researching about options so please don't flame me if I'm missing something.

I basically looked for a cheap stock to sell puts on and wondered if PSNY is a good idea. Their volume is horrible and the bid/ask spread huge, so I wanted to ask the following question: Does the spread and volume matter if I'm letting the CSP expire? Because I could set the bid price and if volume is too low and my bid price as well, the order won't go through and if it does, I'm lucky. Is it correct if I say that volume / ask price basically wouldn't matter if I just waited until expiration? For I wouldn't have to worry about volume / ask price because I'm not buying to close? Am I missing something here?

I just wanted a cheap stock which has high potential to grow and either they were meme stocks like PLTR or just sectors I don't believe in. The only other good option I saw was LCID. I just thought that PSNY is a good choice because I believe in the futures of EV's and the design of their cars is very marketable. Do you have a better suggestion?

I would be very glad about constructive criticism!"|0.75|2|0|2

t3_x3hqc5|1662064204|options|Easily Making the VIX of Any Stock + Challenge Questions|"**Background**

Much talk about the VIX has been boiled down to it being a “fear gauge” or some other vague notion of it being a volatility index. Both of these are correct, but let’s get slightly deeper into what the VIX really is.

In sum, the VIX is the market saying “Hey, there’s a 68% probability that I’ll go up or down by this value over the next year. I might be over or under shooting that value, but today, I say there’s a 68% probability of that.”

So, a VIX of $20 represents what the annual volatility estimate of the market is (20% up or down), with a probability of 68%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mfbr7lxq3bl91.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14e284b4e228a907c4a324233f36528afc4437c7

The derivation of the VIX takes in a strip of options, but we will use an easier method in our own calculation, so it isn’t imperative we dive into the formulaic nuance of the VIX calculation(Methodology here: [https://cdn.cboe.com/api/global/us\_indices/governance/Volatility\_Index\_Methodology\_Cboe\_Volatility\_Index.pdf](https://cdn.cboe.com/api/global/us_indices/governance/Volatility_Index_Methodology_Cboe_Volatility_Index.pdf)).

&amp;#x200B;

**Implementing**

You’ll be surprised by how simple this is. All we need to do is track the price of an ATM delta-neutral straddle. So let’s use SPY for example:

* SPY is currently trading at 410
* We take the 410 call and the 410 put, the delta of these two combined are close enough to zero to be considered delta-neutral
* We continuously do this throughout the trading day, changing the straddle as SPY price changes.

But how well does this correlate to the VIX anyway? Well, by quite a bit:

&amp;#x200B;

[August 4th, ExpirationDates of SPY straddles and VIX as benchmark](https://preview.redd.it/tdlc4h6w3bl91.png?width=378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0da639bb63b7bd511cc3cb7a2ce5dccb01780dbc)

The one-month straddle had a correlation to the VIX of 83%!

So now that we have a good way of replicating the VIX, we can apply this to any stock that has an options chain.

Let’s use Apple this time:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n6ywd7iy3bl91.png?width=394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ce2886129aa419ef0c10782bc84a502fe2506fd

This makes sense as AAPL and SPY are quite correlated already, but it adds validity to this model as the correlation of our VIX matches that of the index it is largely represented in.

**Tech Requirements**

This won’t require a complicated setup, all we need is Python and data. Within Python we need to use the pandas package, as we will perform the simple operations on a dataframe. As for data, we will go through CBOE datashop as the data comes pre-structured. The cost is about $13 per day of intraday options that include all strikes and expirations along with greeks. Once you receive the download, you can get to work right away without any cleaning steps.

# Final Thoughts

You have just learned how to create the VIX for quite literally any stock with an options chain. There are a plethora of ways you can monetize this, but here we teach how to fish, not give them away, so here are some questions you should consider, the profits lie therein.

* If you ran this for all constituents of the S&amp;P, but found that some stocks were outliers, can you explain what made its VIX an outlier? Does it have predictive value for its underlying or any others?
* If you created a custom basket of stocks, say a basket of defense stocks, if you calculate all of their VIX’s, can you make an arbitrage by selling the straddle of the overpriced stock, and buying the straddle of the underpriced? Since the stocks are in the same sector and likely correlated, how would that effect risk/reward?
* Do this per sector, then intra-sector. Why is the VIX of home furniture stocks much higher than that of home security stocks?

**I'll leave the code in the comments.**

**TL;DR** \- Make the VIX of any optionable stock by continuously tracking the cost of an ATM delta-neutral straddle."|0.91|125|0|125

Currently the price for Jan 20 U calls with $45 strike is \~$5.9, the market for IS options is not very liquid but the ask for Jan 20 5$ calls is $0.5.

If understand correctly (since this an all stock merger with no cash involved) IS options will simply be converted to U options with an adjusted strike price and lot size. So if I sold U calls and bought an equivalent number of IS calls my positions should cover each other at the time of the merger, leaving me with all the credit I got when opening the positions?

I’m not really sure how exactly this conversion will happen. How I understand it now is that IS calls will have have a different number of shares (10.89) and a strike price (45.91)?

I primarily (95% of the time) use matched ETF pairs - TQQQ/SQQQ (SQQQ now with the marketing going down) in cash secure puts (CSPs).  I mainly trade in the last week or two of the expiration - collecting the premium as it expires worthless.

I have used long calls in the past - but what hurts me is the quickly declining premium.  The best I've been able to come up with is (via optionstrat.com):

* Bull Call Spread

* Bull Put Spread

Let me just add - I intend to keep selling CSPs 95% of the time.  The other 5% of the time, I would like to use a ""synthetic"" call where I would collect some or all of the premium - not have theata work so hard against me.

At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 1.4% to close at $161.38. Apple has long been rumored to be working on its Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality headset. The tech giant may want to have the right to use the term “Reality” for its mixed reality headset.

Apple (ticker: AAPL) could also be seeking to partner with Globalstar (GSAT) on the new smartphone models that would be able to send text messages and make calls via satellite services."|0.39|0|0|0

I'm a seasoned trader but my experience lies with Futures trading. If you have a moment to comment, could you help me better understand the risk of trading Debit Spreads, specifically any \*hidden\* or \*little-known risks\*?

**What I know**:

a) I know many say the Max Risk is the Premium Paid.

b) I also have read the cautionary tale (here on Reddit) of the risks of not closing positions before expiration (even positions that were slated to expire worthless) due to the risk of being assigned based on after-hours movement (that post referenced an iron condor position, but still it was a real eye-opener):

**My approach**:

a) trade Debit Spreads (rather than credit spreads) as they're a better match for me

b) close all positions prior to expiration - no later than 4 days before

c) aim for around 75% of max profit which frees up capital for new trades (I see some advocating aiming for 50% - better perhaps)?

d) don't hold shorts through dividends

\*\*What I know about assignment:\*\*

a) trading like this (I think) makes assignment very unlikely: 1/1000 maybe?

b) assignment can often mean a profit - doesn't always result in a loss

c) if assigned on a short position, simply close the long position to cover.

What I'm not sure about: is there additional risk I should be taking into account when trading Debit Spreads?

**EXAMPLE:**

Say I'm trading a small to medium size account: 30,000.00

Further, say I'm trading Call Debit Spreads or Put Debit Spreads of SPY, or perhaps Amazon, or CAT, etc.

**QUESTIONS** (based on above example):   


**1)** What happens if there's a large, unexpected move in overnight trading and my short position(s) are assigned on market open ... BUT ... because I'm on Pacific Time (and like to sleep in), I don't become aware of that assignment until the market’s been open 5 hours, and price has rocketed back up or down to where it was before the big move? I assume if this were to happen, I'd simply close out my long position(s) and whatever the difference was between what I close them for and what my short positions were assigned for would be my loss (and/or gain), right? In other words, the loss would still be limited (but obviously could still be considerably more than the premium between the two positions). Right? (Just wanted to make sure I'm not missing something).

**2)** To account for the above risk (small though it may be), how many positions of SPY or stocks like Amazon or CAT would you trade if you didn't want to lose more than 30% of your 30,000.00 account in one unlikely event?

**3)** Should I limit my trading of debit spreads to small stocks (say $15.00 - 35.00 range) and if so, how may positions of a $30 stock would you trade to minimize the risk of losing more than 30% of your account in a unusual event like described above?

I'm not risk averse. I take on risk trading futures knowing there can be limit moves (although I try and avoid the markets that are most prone to those), etc. I just want to make sure I'm properly understanding the risks of Debit Spreads so that I can size my trades accordingly.

I also know that instead of trading stocks or SPY, I could trade options on indexes and things like MES or XSP which I believe are cash settled and in the case of XSP and index options, have more favorable tax treatment I believe (section 1256?). But, then there's the question of liquidity and I'd rather not have to limit myself as there are so many great optionable stocks that are seasonable.

If you can shed some light on any of the three questions above, that'd be much appreciated. Maybe you know of other hidden or little-known risks of Debit Spreads? If so, please enlighten me.

Thanks!"|0.67|2|0|2

I’ve accepted the loss, learned my lesson and looking at the best way to move forward. However, I want to make sure I don’t trigger any wash sales. For those of you who have been through this, please advise:

Position: 
25 leaps @ 16.9860 cost basis 

Suppose the current bid vs. ask is 0.50 x 0.55. However, the bid only has 20 @0.50 and then 5@0.40. So when I sell, 20 will be sold at 0.50 each and the remaining 4 will be sold at 0.40 each. Even though the leaps were sold in two different lots, this wouldn’t trigger a wash sale since nothing was re-purchased and I have held all leaps for more than 30 days right? 

If I sold a cover call and bought-to-close for a profit within thirty days would that then trigger a wash sale if I sold these leaps for a loss today? Since wash sale rule is that not only can you not repurchase the same/similar security within 30 days after the sale, but you cannot also purchase the same stock within 30 days prior to sale. So is buying-to-close the covered call considered purchasing the same stock within 30 days prior to the sale? 

Pictures are attached in the link below showing dates and positions in more detail with both scenarios of selling all at 0.50 and some at 0.50 and the rest at 0.40.

t3_x1kzfd|1661870764|options|Leveraging Money Flow: Cyclicals, Computer Software, and Retail|"Let momentum inform strategy to ride the coat tails of ""smart money"".

**Money flow indicates staying power.** That is, when money is flowing into a sector, related stocks will often experiences bounces after pull backs and develop sustained uptrends. And when money is flowing out of a sector, you might see pops get successfully shorted and bearish trends establish themselves.

**How to use this study:**

Day traders can use subsector momentum studies like this one to identify momentum stocks and develop greater conviction in a predicted move.

**The magic sauce:**

I use the Growth 250 list created by Investor's Business Daily (of which I am unaffiliated) to understand the depth and breadth of the market any given week. This is their best estimation of the top 250 growth stocks in the market. I keep a running study of this list, tracking money flows between subsectors.

Keeping an eye on this flow has proven to be a *huge boon* to my edge. I have found that when I trade in subsectors that are seeing changes in money flow that there is an increased level of continuation that correlates to the flow, whether positive or negative. And to put it simply, this translates into bigger moves with reduced chop.

# This Week's Money Flow Report

**TL;DR**

More rotation into other areas of Specialty Chemicals as the entire Chemical Sector flattens out with another industry group breaking out. Even more flow into Oil &amp; Gas and Utilities as commodities see continuation. Meanwhile Computer Software and Retail are looking like a sell.

**Buy Side**

* *Chemicals-Agricultural*
   * Cyclicals continue to lead as growth stocks sell on economic uncertainty. With the war in Ukraine continuing to wreak havoc on the Agri-chemical supply and the market seeking opportunity in essential commodities right, these names broke out last week. They look really extended and not actionable this week as more consolidation is needed. Still worth watching them action for more signals on how the market is reacting.
   * Favorite name in this industry group is: CF with NTR and MOS looking worthy too.
* *Oil &amp; Gas*
   * More of the same here. It will be interesting to watch big cap leaders XOM CVX MRO this week — would love to see them build a handle now. In addition, with any more uncertainty in the strength economy, these stock are could just as easily sell or at best need more consolidation.
   * One I like here from a technical perspective is RRC —  it has yet to really breakout. I also like the relative strength of APA MUR CRK. If I trade these names I may look to close out the position by day’s end to avoid any sensitivity to news catalysts versus trying to swing trade these oil &amp; gas names where they are now.
* *Utilities*
   * As stated last week, these are extended. Still, the inflow continues in these names. Similar to oil &amp; gas, I’d like to see them pull in here and make a handle. Utilities seem to have a head start on this as they were very extended going into last week and closed around the place I’d like to see as support for the handle.
   * AES has yet to break out of its base. NEE looks strong testing handle support to close Friday as well. AMPS is a very aggressive mover to watch — if it breaks out of the handle, could really run.

**Sell Side**

* *Computer Software*
   * With growth companies getting slapped by the Fed last week this is no surprise. Many have insane valuations with some worthy set up for short selling. These are strictly growth companies with high P/E ratios + book values that are going to suffer under tighter monetary policy.
   * Some worth watching include: FTNT DDOG NET SPLK $U OKTA
* *Retail*
   * With most of the big retailers reporting last week, we were able to build more of a picture of how consumers are behaving in today’s economy. Even the most defensive retailers struggled on their reports for many reasons we talked about in an earlier report. There are specific areas of retail to target based on last week’s reports and some additional technical analysis:

1. Wholesale Building Products — FAST FND LOW 2. Discount &amp; Variety — OLLI BIG FIVE 3. Leisure Products — DKS BFV ASO 4. Restaurants — SBUX YUM

# Review: Last Week

**TL;DR**

Last week added up to a very satisfying week to be long commodities, taking profit in solar/alternative energy and going short semiconductors.

**Fossil Fuels**

Last week’s *buy side* focused on coal names to respond to gains from alternative energy as of late. BTU made for a nice trade up nearly 12% for the week but was drug down by Chairman Powell’s comments to a final gain of 6.64% to close the week. Same story with the oil and gas names we identified, although they were also drug down into close Friday with everything else.

**Retail**

Value retail names did not pan out as hoped DLTR earnings report was highly disappointing. That said, we did not trade any of these but did notice that KR had more relative strength versus COST — which confirms an earlier concern that COST is probably a bit overpriced here by fair-value comparison.

**Utilities**

Utilities took a pause here as well. The SPDR Select - Utilities (XLU) did show some relative strength though, down only -1.53% and perhaps building a handle for more upside on a tough week for stocks.

**Semiconductors**

Last week’s sell side took focus on semiconductors with Nvidia’s lowered guidance going into earnings and most of those names looking very extended, that rotation was self-evident last week. Still the market’s response to Chairman Powell’s comments, from this mostly growth-focused area of the market, was SELL. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) finished the week -5.56% making for some powerful down moves.

**Alternative and Solar Energy**

We also looked to rotate out of alternative energy and solar positions as they take a pause. Enphase Energy (ENPH) still looks like it could hold this breakout range down only -3.74% on the week but will need some time to consolidate and produce enough earnings/sales momentum to decompresses the valuation before another leg up is rational.

t3_x16yvo|1661825839|options|MNMD 1-for-15 Reverse Split Options|"I'm not quite understanding how this split was handled. Well, for the shares it make sense, but it appears the ratio used for the option split was different.

Since this is 1-for-15, for every 1 share of MNMD you own, you would receive 0.0666 shares instead. Example: if you have 1000 shares, post split you would end up with 66.6667, which is being rounded to the nearest whole number, 67 in this case.

However, for options, the OCC handled this split by changing the share entitlement from 100 shares per contract to 7. Would this not create new derivative shares out of thin air? Why would the OCC not use the same ratio of 0.0666 (1/15), and now entitle 6.666 shares per contract? Is this because of the need to have a round number? 

What if someone had covered calls? Would this not create a net naked short position since more shares are in derivative form in the contracts than the shares they own post split?

ALSO, it looks like the options with the old strike prices are still available for purchase, so does this not create some sort of arbitrage opportunity?

For Sept 16th expiry strikes 0.5 through 7.5 are still available for purchase and are trading at pre split prices - the only thing that appears to have changed is that they now entitle you to 7 shares instead of 100. 

So if I bought a 0.5 strike call option for sept 16th and paid the last price of 0.3, that would cost me $30 and entitle me to 7 shares at the original 0.5 strike price.

$30 + 7 x $0.5 = $33.50 for 7 shares of a stock that's trading at $12 per share = 60% discount 

This doesn't add up...

I have decided to use this money to build my portfolio as well as eventually in one year make roughly 5-10k a month on this strategy. I have worked out hypothetical situations, averages of high and lows and I cannot seem to see a negative consequence. Please rip this apart so I can understand if my plan is flawed. 

NOTE: I plan to hold AMD as a very long term investment as I believe in the company and have done my dd. 

Step1: buy 220 shares of AMD
Step 2: sell 2 CCs a week at 2-3$ above the current price. 
Step 3: make the premium and if it gets executed make the 600$ as well. 
Step4(if executed): buy back my shares at the new price regardless of price and repeat selling weekly CCs.
(If not executed): sell weekly’s again the next week
Step5: use the premiums to buy more shares of AMD until eventually I have 300 shares and can sell 3 calls a week to make more profit.

Repeat for a year.

I understand the risk of the stock going down and the stock going way up during my calls.

I plan to treat my initial investment and capital going forward as a rental property and not care about the short term up and down flow.

My projection is that in a year I can have roughly 80k and enough shares to have 6-8 options to sell. 

I understand that in a bull market this works better but again, I don’t care if my calls get executed because I’ll buy back and use the premium and amount I make off the shares to buy enough to sell more options.

t3_x13n3e|1661816678|options|500k Day Trade Call|"Hi everyone,

Last week I opened a 0-dte spread on SPX and then at the end of the day closed the short leg and let the long leg (which was worth 0.00) expire since I couldn't have sold it anyway. From reading here and elsewhere it seems doing this can cause you to receive a massive day trade call as this is looked at as a naked put trade, and with SPX being around 4000, each contract is 400k, so it adds up. Anyway with 10 of these spreads, it amounted to day trade call of over 500k.

At first I thought I owed them this much money (and the people on the phone weren't saying otherwise at first, saying it was a valid call which didn't answer my question and also made me think I still owed that much somehow). But it turns out I am just basically banned from trading for 90 days - it's not like a margin call as I first thought. However I can't trade unless I add this amount to my account for at least two days, which isn't happening.

Has anyone here encountered this before? I feel like it doesn't make much sense and have a few questions.

1. Do other brokers do this?
2. If all brokers do this, then how do we set a stop limit on a spread? Most brokers (including Fidelity) do not have that as a feature, so what is done is to just put a stop on the short leg...but doing this would result in this current situation. It's almost like they are encouraging you to get wrecked with a policy like this.
3. If I move brokers (this is not the first time I've had issues with Fidelity so definitely not opposed to the move) will I still be under this restriction? The guy on the phone said it would be there no matter which broker I pick, but reading online it seems this is a Fidelity-specific issue (in fact some brokers encourage putting stops on short legs for protection). He wasn't right about some other things, so I don't really trust him on this anyway. Has anyone else been able to close spreads using the short leg first? What brokers do you use?

Any information would be greatly appreciated! Thank you."|0.58|3|0|3

For each stock, the position on the y axis is the implied move from options pricing: looking at ATM closest expiration straddle (call and put closest to the stock price, ideally delta neutral) breakeven. Breakeven is the amount of absolute move, in either direction, of the stock price needed for the position to be worth its initial price.

https://preview.redd.it/2vyp12ekikk91.png?width=1847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2f46119ac184cab107ede640171cb45aae8d0e1

## 

&amp;#x200B;

## Implied vs Historic Pricing by Sector

The x axis is showing the average historic move for the stock on all past releases: that's the mean of the the highest / lowest variation of the stock the day after release. This is based on historic data. The y axis is based on current options pricing - the implied move. The upper part of the graph (above the y=x middle line) are stocks where the implied is higher than the past average - expectations are higher than what happened in the past. And vice versa for the lower part and undervalued

## 

&amp;#x200B;

## Past Moves Distribution by Sector

Each graph is a histogram: x axis are values of moves (absolute move, in any direction, happening the day of release) and y axis is the occurrence of that move (in percentage) - the peak is the move that happened the most historically and the shape of the curve shows how these past moves are distributed. The dashed line is the classic implied move from ATM options pricing.

t3_x0a7le|1661731763|options|Selling and buying far covered calls: A strategy I use|"Alright so let's talk about this strategy. The strategy I am using is for covered calls for the stocks that have dipped. Here's the strategy example to make great gains off of option premiums using time and theta with little to no risk:

So let's say GOOGL is at $100. For the September 2nd premium, we'll use a 101c premium example of $1.50, or $150. You sell it for $150. 2 days later, GOOGL stock is at $97. Now the premium is worth only $50. What you would do is you would buy the premium back and you would sell a premium at a LATER date to profit off of theta premiums, which you would sell another premium at anywhere later in the dates. I'll use September 16 as an example, which you would sell an option (as an example) with a strike price of $101 for $2.00, or $200. If the stock price goes lower to 95, you would buy the premium back and then do the same thing at a later expiry. HOWEVER, if it goes back to 100 or higher, the premium will rise, and you could get assigned. This strategy will limit your losses but will also limit or take away your gains.

What are your thoughts on this play? I feel like it's reliable because you will lower your average buy order. You can even put half the premium into buying back the stock so you can snowball and lower average cost price."|0.8|18|0|18

**Last Week –** After a period of declining volatility and moves in line with expectations volatility roared back and the SPY declined 4.3% on the week, significantly more than the 1.7% move options were pricing.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing a 2.2% move for the upcoming week.

**Implied Volatility / VIX –** The VIX closed the week near 26, up from 21 last week and 19 the week before. VIX futures are still higher than spot but no longer the steep curve we saw the past few weeks. December futures are near 28 and Jan 2023 and beyond months are all above 28,

* SPY **2.2%** (+/- $9)
* QQQ **2.8%** (+/- $9)
* IWM **2.7%** (+/- $5)
* DIA **2%** (+/- $6.50)

## In the News

The big news last week was the Powell-triggered sell-off on Friday. Markets had a bad reaction immediately and then got worse all day.

The selling caught options off guard. The VIX was below 20 in mid-August, something we hadn’t seen since April. Back in April a sub-20 VIX preceded a market sell-off that took the VIX above 34. Another IV spike above 34 in June marked the lows of the year in the SPY and preceded the recent rally.

The VIX closed below 26 on Friday, still below the middle of this year’s range. SPY options are pricing a weekly move near 2%, while in prior selloffs this year SPY options were regularly pricing moves of more than 3%. In other words, selling IV at these levels is positioning that Friday’s selloff won’t continue. While buying IV at these levels is positioning that the market is headed back towards the yearly lows.

For its part, the SPY is now roughly 15% off its highs, and 10% from its low on the year. SPY options are pricing about 10% move in either direction for the rest of 2022:

I bought SPY puts a few days ago and today's disastrous market brought my gains up to approximately 150% per contract (I still haven't sold). I'm also long \~2700 BBBY shares due to its &lt;100% SI, strong retail sentiment, and non-correlation with the broader market. On top of that, I plan on selling 27 1/20 BBBY 27C contracts @ 2.47 on Monday. This should leave me with about 6K in premium, bringing my cash total to approximately 44K (37K currently).

I confident that the market will fall further due to the tightening of the economy, but I'm not sure how I can safely profit off of this prediction. Implied volatility has skyrocketed, making puts very expensive, and I'm terrified of IV crushes (previously burned 20K due to this).

**TLDR;** Any advice on what to bet against/do next would be greatly appreciated :)

**Full Positions:**

**SPY:**

9/23 407P x 9 @ 4.49 \~ 10.3K

9/21 375P x 20 @ 1.58 \~ 4.9K

t3_wzvzp6|1661694638|options|8/28-9/2 plays|"With the carnage that happened on Friday I don’t think this market is going up much further from here but on the other hand I am very confused as to why there was mass selling on blue chip companies that have been posting great earnings quarter after quarter.  Powell didn’t say anything we didn’t know. I believe with the mass sell off there will be many retail investors picking up these stocks for a significant discount which may open the door for a few plays. After reviewing the RSI values they are substantially below 30 (due to the major sell off Friday) but again we’re targeting companies that don’t seem to be affected by much. 

My plays are:

Everything I bought is expiring 9/09:

GOOGL $111 call 
AMZN $131 call 
WMT $131 call 
MSFT $270 call 
SBUX $84 call
FORD $15 put 
MANU $13 put

t3_wxmaw7|1661453676|options|My $70 strategy for tomorrows earnings DELL GPS HPQ|"This is mostly a note to myself that I’m sharing because it would be nice to learn from any comments.

I’m trying to make the most money on earnings tomorrow but keep it low risk. I’m going to use a strangle (call and put) cuz ive lost too much choosing one direction only.

I pick two businesses I kind of know that report tomorrow Dell and Gap (GPS). I see that GPS could possibly make the biggest movement % according to r/earningswatcher but when I plug into options calculator it will hard to make money if I spend less than $100.

DELL has a smaller predicted % movement after earnings, but easier to make money according to options calc. But if I buy earliest option sep 16 call (2nd out of money from strikeprice $54) and put (3rd out of money from strike $64) for about $118 total i’ll only earn $1-$4 if stock moves up or down about 3% the next day.

HPQ does not report tomorrow. But in May when Dell had earnings and rose 11%, HPQ rose about 5%. According to options calc HPQ is the best deal. If i buy the earliest option 8/26 (expires tomorrow) call (1st out of money from strikeprice $36) and a put (1st in the money for $33) for about $69 total ill earn $28 if the stock moves up or down 3% the next day. If it moves 5% then i’ll earn $100. Also I like how magically ill earn just about the same $ evenly for each % the stock goes up or down. The price moves unevenly favoring a call or put for GPS and DELL. And i dont want to have to choose a preference to make more money favoring a call or put. Im trying to avoid guessing if Dell will go up or down tomorrow.

So I bought the HPQ put and call contract.

Notes: i think GPS had little pay off compared to DELL because GPS stock price is only about $10 and Dell is about $40. And because GPS has more IV implied volatility (i use barchart.com). I noticed stocks with high implied volatility have overpriced options that dont make money unless theres big movement. And HPQ had less IV than Dell so maybe thats why HPQ is more profitable. Also HPQ has options expiring tomorrow. But Dell only has options starting to expire in September. So thats prolly another reason why HPQ was a better deal.

Im broke and risk adverse after making too many bad bets. I cant believe last quarter i bought a naked unprotected ROST option for $250 and made about $800 on earnings. Those were wild times and thats why Im broke. I feel like GPS and Dell should have a bad earnings tomorrow because inflation and economy sucking. But who knows it could go either way. Also outside factor the jackson hole thing tomorrow could also have impact. I really want to bet on an earnings but Im tired of losing money.

Ive tried strangles before but they were too out of money or the stock didnt move enough %. Tomorrow I find out if my hpq plan actually worked."|0.5|0|0|0

t3_wx15g8|1661391747|options|Strategies for Shorting Volatility (in times of panic) While Avoiding IV Crush *SUGGESTIONS WELCOME*|"TLDR; I would like to short volatility when VIX peaks. This play is (historically) guaranteed to pay off. My question is, if I buy puts on the VIX (or similar products), will I get IV crushed when the VIX inevitably falls? How severe will it be? How can I work around this?

No, I am not going short volatility now. However, I am expecting market turbulence in due time, and when vol does spike, I want to profit off of its (usually rapid) fall. If I short vol using options, I fear IV crush. I also do not want to outright short any ticker. Below I will lay out tickers and strategies that I have considered and my thought process surrounding each one. Feel free to correct me if you have more experience trading volatility or just more overall knowledge of price action during crashes.

**The obvious plays:** 

Long Puts on UVXY or Long Calls on SVXY (short vol etf)--- This is the obvious choice for me. It gives me the leverage I desire. The directionality of the play is pretty straight forward as well, theta should not be an issue. My fear is IV. Is this fear rational? I expect the entire options chain to be extremely overpriced when VIX peaks. But when it falls will the premiums collapse with it?

**My work arounds to avoid (potential) IV crush:**

Long SVXY Shares-- I have considered going long SVXY shares. *Why?* There is no risk of IV crush as I am staying away from options. However, SVXY is not leveraged to my liking, and I would like to get more exposure to the short side of the VIX.

Short  SVXY Puts or Short UVXY Calls -- Pretty self explanatory. However, I would never go short calls so that's not an option. I have considered going short puts on SVXY. This would allow me to profit of high IV, but the collateral is almost always not worth the return on plays like these.

Is my thought process in the right ballpark at all? What would you do if you were trying to execute this strategy?"|0.8|17|0|17
t3_wx0nat|1661390359|options|My level5 application was rejected, but I have margin account. Does it make sense?|"I use MerrillEdge broker (because of the BofA relationship) and recently I applied for level 5 options trading. I just need to be able to sell naked puts. Not much, 15% of my available margin at most. I also need naked puts, because ME system is so weird, that when I have open limit order to write a PUT option, that collateral would take the remaining of my cash and I want to edit the limit price in this order - it throws an error, that I don't have enough cash. I literally must cancel the order and then reopen it with a different limit. Not to mention I can't even roll, when my balance is too low (because it need double the collateral for that).

Anyway... here's what's really strange. My total account value is $210k and I already have a margin account, with additional $180k of buying power. So they literally allowed me to buy over $100k worth of stock on margin, but they don't allow me to sell naked puts. I don't follow the logic. Why? Is selling puts really more risky than buying shares?

Why would they allow me a margin account, but not allow to sell naked puts?"|0.74|47|0|47

t3_wwxrxc|1661382598|options|Wheeling the BAC - boring wheel on the boring stock|"So hear me out. I was looking for some good value stock to wheel. Criterias were like this: Price of one share had to be under $50 so, you know, not to get under water if it goes tits up. I like it to be a value stock with decent dividend yield, but not over 3,5% so it does not mess up with share prices around ex-dates too much. Solid, recocnized company for at atractive valuation. Buybacks were very wellcome, obviously.

So I found that BAC - Bank of America corp to tick all of the boxes and some more. And guess what, the premiums were pretty juicy, for such a boring stock. I was not surprised, a lot of shit was going on, but you know, it is BAC...

So far I have done one full cycle, net $50 (lol) after commissions in 4 months, so cca 4,2% yearly return on $3600 required capital. It is not much I know, but I am aiming for 6% yearly return in the long run, so this kind of fulfill my aim, accounting for my mistakes I am aware of.

The trades in short were like this: wrote the Put at $36 for $0.52 in April, got put shares in May. Wrote 2 calls, which expired worthless for $0.54 total. Finally I wrote the last call at $35 in July for $0.29 and my shares were called away in August. Got the $0.21 divi meanwhile.

I am aware of my mistake with the last call under the original put strike. But the shares were so heavy under water. I was selling the cca 17 delta calls just to do something. And then the last bull run came. Few more days and the stock price was under strike price again. I let the call expire ITM (did not roll) because I was feeling like the bull run was out of steam at a strong resistance and wanted the cash to be more flexible.

What do you guys think of this all? It feels weird, but I kinda like it. The shares were heavily under water. And I came out pretty well. Of Course it is not thanks to my genius, I am aware of it, lol. But I was ready to hold the shares for a long time at attractive valuation and write the calls against them, while receiving dividends.

I am probably going to write September put $32 for cca $0.32.

Give me your thoughts on this. I will appreciate them all.

P.S.: English is not my native language.

When you sell a covered call, the best case scenario is it passes your short strike (that’s where max profit is). Selling a covered call on something you want to keep is unnecessarily fighting yourself. 

And before someone says- “I’m just trying to collect additional income” that’s fine - but the sentiment above stands. 

That’s NOT to be confused with our ability to manage the short call to find the most profitable scenario. I have deep ITM short calls against SPY that I rolled once and am now going to allow assignment.

These are the trades:

I started the day (08/19/22)with a vertical spread that i opened the day before (08/18/22):

SPY vertical sell
19 SPY 419P 26/08 buy
19 SPY 424P 26/08 sell

And these are the trades i made during the day:

1. SPY vertical buy to cover
19 SPY 419P 26/08 sell
19 SPY 424P 26/08 buy

2. SPY vertical sell
18 SPY 414P 26/08P buy

3. SPY vertical buy to cover
18 SPY 414P 26/08P sell
18 SPY 419P 26/08P buy

You can see the 419P 26/08was traded the most during the day and could be the reason, but day trade rules say closing a position from the day before and then day trading the same security should count only as 1 day trade during the day.

I had 1 DT available yesterday, but after i used it i was marked as a PDT, so not only did they count this trade as two day trades but they also showed me i had a DT available when according to them i didn’t have anymore DTs available.

t3_wu7plh|1661109460|options|Exit Strategies|"I'm realizing that my biggest weakness is exit strategy. I prefer to go with momentum so getting in hasn't been nearly as hard as figuring out when to get out. If I'm right the day after I buy, that's great. So do I sell then? If so, why not get right back into the same position the next day? When trends change and a stock is no longer in the same trend, I cut my losses. But I seem to give winners more slack and basically hold until they break trend, which at best majorly eats into my profit but usually ends up with those being losses as well. 

I understand if I buy a put because a stock shot up today and I expect people to take profit tomorrow, if I'm right, I'll know tomorrow morning and can get out, that's an easy one because you expected something specific the next day and you're either right or wrong. But with simply hopping on a trend, there's no clear timeline until it breaks trend.

So what can I do to be better? Watch specific greeks? Set a time limit such as *no matter what, I'm getting out a week from now*? Have a simple loss/gain trigger (gain more than 50% or lose more than 15% = sell)? Or what?

I try not to get into tons of indicators, constantly watching charts, etc. I'd prefer to get into a position and stay in it for a week to a month. I think given how choppy things have been lately, the month is a bit long, we can reverse two or more times in a month with a lot of stocks lately, so I know I probably need to plan on 1-5 day holds.

What am I missing?"|0.73|5|0|5

## In the News

Over the weekend Tesla (TSLA) announced a 25% increase to the price of their “full self-driving” software. Tesla shares are up 40% from recent lows and off about 5% from recent highs. Over the past year Tesla stock has seen multiple 20%+ rallies that take place over 3-4 week spans. The most recent rally from July 15th to August 15th was the largest of those moves percentage-wise. Since the all time high in Nov of ’21 the stock has put in two lower highs at the apex of these sharp rallies, first in January, then in April. The last large move lower in the stock that happened from early April to mid May saw the stock down more than 50%.

As stated before, Tesla stock has seen moves way beyond option pricing on a consistent basis for the past year, both higher and lower. Here’s a look at the past year’s moves as compared to the current expected move in the options market. Options are pricing about an 11% move over the next month, and only about a 25% move out to January, much less than the types of moves the stock has seen over the past year:

t3_wu56te|1661103078|options|This has been my most profitable 0DTE options trading strategy|"For 16 months the 0DTE Breakeven Iron Condor has been my most profitable options strategy. In fact only one month (January 2022) ended with a loss.

Many have asked how the strategy did in the turbulent first half of 2022, so I decided to do a new write-up. You find the article here: [https://www.sandvand.net/2022/08/21/learnings-from-0dte-breakeven-iron-condor/](https://www.sandvand.net/2022/08/21/learnings-from-0dte-breakeven-iron-condor/)

The strategy is quite simple: I sell Iron Condors on SPX at 5 - 10 delta at different times of the day.  I set separate stop losses on each of the two spreads equal to the total premium of the IC (typically I add 10 dollars on top of that). Usually I let the Iron Condors expire, but I will also sometimes close them early to lock in some profit. 

This is a very tight stop loss compared to what most people do, and yes it will lead to more losses. Yet, the strategy as such has proven profitable.

Here is the summary after trading this strategy from April 20221 until today:

* I have done 1344 trades (usually I do 5-7 trades per day)
* The win rate has been 38,3 %, and the loss rate 61,7 %. This has stayed very consistent during this period.
* All trades are with one contract only - and I will never commit more than 15.000 USD in buying power, which means that I will have a maximum of 5 trades on simultaneously (but usually less)
* I have made 16.814 dollars on the strategy so far. For the one-year period of August 2021 to July 2022 I made 12.681, which is 84,5 % of my max buying power committed to the strategy.
* The average win (99 dollars) is 2,4 times as high as the average loss (41 dollars) - hence the positive expectancy despite most trades being losses.
* The biggest risk to the strategy is double stop losses. This has happened in 3,8 % of my trades. This percentage has stayed quite consistent as well during the whole period.

This is not the only 0DTE strategy I do on SPX. But I like that I rarely have days with big losses. It fits my trading style and risk willingness. 

Hope you find it interesting."|0.97|398|0|398
t3_wu1thb|1661094468|options|Assessing risk and developing strategy|"I'm looking for guides to best assess risks and model returns.  I've read up on the greeks, and watched enough videos between youtube and Ameritrade's teaching tools to think I've exhausted those resources - I'm looking for opinions on how to proceed with building a mathematical model to exercise or simulate potential returns for given scenarios.  Full disclosure - I have not played around in TOS' paper money mode...  I'm just not sure that'd help me here, but feel free to suggest specific use cases if I'm wrong about that.  I feel like I'm probably missing some key search terms or concepts...

For example - let's look at selling covered ASTS calls.  I expect the stock to do well, but not quadruple anytime soon, so I'd sell a NOV 18 call at 17.50 strike (presently going for 1.30).  I doubt stock will exceed 17.50 by then, and if it did, I'd be comfortable selling for that price relative my average cost per share.  I'd not commit all my stock, I'd only sell a handful of calls so if it did explode I'd profit from that as well.  I'm long term bullish on ASTS - and yes, they are likely to launch their test satellite before Nov 18, and that will have a significant impact on stock value.

This strategy hedges in case the stock does ""moon"" in the near term (I don't lose all my stock) and if it craters, I keep the premium and move on.  So far so good for my assessment of the company.

But how do I optimize the number of calls I sell (the percent of stock I'm willing to gamble) for my desired risk posture?  For that matter, what specific metric should I research to determine how to quantify my risk posture?  This is now a much more general question about managing stocks and options portfolios.

I've thought of making a monte carlo simulation - but that'll ultimately result in me seeing a distribution telling me that there is 50% chance I sold ""too many"" calls, or ""not enough"" calls to optimize near term gains.  If it goes over 17.50, I'm missing out on gains - so if I'm long term bullish on ASTS, it suggests I shouldn't sell calls...  Already knowing where that is going, it seems like a pointless exercise that would shut out all exposure to risks.  It all comes down to how much premium I want today to offset the risk of missing out on more gains I expose myself to between now and Nov 18...  And I've got to say ""no duh"" to that - it's all about satiating today's greed while keeping tomorrow's best interests - this is a core goal of investment managing I think.

I've used [optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://optionsprofitcalculator.com), but it gives a simple calc of return based on IV - not quite what I'm looking for.  I'm more interested in a total-cost-of-ownership for a combination of the stock and premium, as a function of IV...  I feel like this is a basic concept I've missed, or maybe it's a more complicated concept that isn't generally discussed where I've been reading.

Back to my question - with respect to quantifying risk, how do I establish a target for number of calls to sell for a given strike?  If I set a low strike and get a high premium, it's offset by the stock trading higher - depending on how much higher, the loss of stock is made up for by the higher premium, provided the premium isn't much lower than the positive change in stock price.  How do I use the greeks to guide my selection?

There has to be a better answer than ""what do I think the stock will do?""  I'm looking for math that gives me a probability about ""what I think"" where I can assess something quantitatively...

Anyway - thanks for any pointers, I'm always happy to take the time and learn more."|0.87|15|0|15

t3_wtv3w2|1661072842|options|Can I use Kelly Criterion to decide my exits?|"Last week I felt like QQQ has more chances to go down than up from here so I bought 1 x QQQ Dec30'22 325 Put. Now, it's green 280 so I feel like selling at the open Monday. However, if it went red I would have closed at about 600 I guess. I have this problem of letting losers run more than winners.

Using this Kelly Criterion calculator here: [https://kellycriterioncalculator.com/](https://kellycriterioncalculator.com/).

If I put 6000 for account, odds 2.5 and probability 60 it says I should wager 2000. I bought the contract for 18.

With odds 2 I get *The expected value of this wager is approximately $1200.00\*\[(1.00)(0.6) + (-1)(0.4)\] = $240.00, which equates to a 20.00% return on the funds wagered.*

But if I put 2.5 odds *I get The expected value of this wager is approximately $2000.00\*\[(1.50)(0.6) + (-1)(0.4)\] = $1000.00, which equates to a 50.00% return on the funds wagered*.

My question is how should I play the red scenario? If I close now, locking odds at 2 what should have been the exit in the red scenario? Same value but as a loss?

Or should I play 2.5 winning odds, so let this run more but if it goes red then stop at 2 odds that is -240?

Using the Kelly Criterion how do I make it so that I don't let losers run longer than winners?"|0.57|1|0|1

Let's say we have a stock priced at $50 that announced $5 dividend on 30 Aug.

I am selling $60 26 Aug PUT for $10 and buying $60 2 Sep PUT for $11 . It costs me $1

&amp;#x200B;

So I see two main scenarios:

&amp;#x200B;

1) The price doesn't reach $60 on 26 Aug

On 26 Aug the option is assigned and I buy stock for $60

On 30 Aug the dividend of $5 is paid

On 1 Sep I exercise the second option and sell the stock for $60

So the profit is: $5 (dividend) - $1 (options cost) = $4 (before taxes)

&amp;#x200B;

2) The price reaches $60 on 26 Aug

I buy the stock for $61 or less

The first option expires

On 30 Aug the dividend of $5 is paid

On 1 Sep I exercise the second option and sell the stock for $60

So the profit is: $5 (dividend) - $1 (options cost) - $1 (stock loss) = $3 (before taxes)

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the risk of not being able to buy the stock for $61 in case of a gap. Any other risks? Ideas on how to play it better? Mistakes?"|0.77|17|0|17
t3_wto7b8|1661048725|options|I took a big loss trying to day trade BBBY, looking into selling CC's to recoup losses?|"Stupidly enough, I tried day trading BBBY and was doing well taking profits every 10 minutes with an in-and-out strategy ($2K profits). I got comfortable and did not use stop losses or any risk management and long story short, I ended up losing 50% of my capital with a $17K realized loss. Absolutely devasted as I experienced similar losses in 2 other instances. 

I have decided to recoup these losses using the covered calls. I know GME has always had a high premium and looking to sell weekly ATM CC's for maximum premium.  I have ~$31K capital available for this. I previously held GME but at a high average of $47 so it was difficult selling CC's due to my average and rode the downturn the market took with it. I still made ~$2.5K in premiums by selling CC's when I took the chance and recently sold at $47 when it spiked. This sucks because of all those months of sitting on those losses with GME and finally exiting with a net profit only to lose half of it on BBBY the very next day.

My strategy: Monitor prices this week as it might be a bit bearish and buy ~900 shares between the $33 to $35 price if it falls that much. Sell 9 ITM call contracts at my average buy-in price. I looked up the premiums and the $35 8/26 are going for around $3.2 to $3.5.

Scenario: 900 shares at $35 average. Sell 9 weekly contracts at $35 strike for $3.4 each and gain $3K in premiums. If assigned, I make $3K for the week and if it goes a bit below the $35 price, my average would be $31.67 now. I would have to pull this off 5 times to make back my losses which is technically possible but I know there are way too many factors that could change everything so I want to take this week by week and reassess. 

I can't wheel because my account does not allow selling puts so I can only do CC's. The potential downsides to this are if GME rips to $40+, I would miss out on those gains (willing to live with this one) or GME somehow completely tanks to below $25 and I am now bag holding it again (very unlikely for this week but anything is possible). GME earnings are also around the corner on September 7th so I would probably not want to hold during that week.

I have looked into safer options in SPY/QQQ but the premiums aren't high enough for the capital that is required (can't even do this for SPY). 

I will not be trading/scalping options which are extremely tempting to me but the risk involved is too much. I got caught up doing calculations if I buy x amount of contracts and the price moves this much, I could recoup all my losses in one go but I don't have the experience nor the bravado to attempt that. I have a $550 account where I have started playing with 0 DTEs but not with my main account. 

Should I be considering something for this strategy that I may have overlooked? GME has been a premium heaven over the last 1.5 years where people have a negative cost basis by just selling CC's. Obviously, there is always risk involved which is why I want to stick to weeklies for this with aggressive ITM strikes to get assigned. 

Any other viable options to best use my capital to recoup losses in a safer way? I am not looking to revenge trade nor trying to make back everything in one go. The goal is to make small gains and compound profits till that $17K goal is hit."|0.36|0|0|0

t3_wtcai6|1661015665|options|BBBY trading volume something smells funny…|"BBBY newly assigned shares &amp; MM delta hedging.

So for the past seven weeks I’ve had a 96.3% success rate selling CSP’s. This week however all of my positions got assigned. This is obviously a market wide downward sift  however it has me thinking about how “market forces” effected the price and the broader impact. BBBY in particular had excessive volume this week. Consider the following metrics. 

Total shares outstanding 79,960,000
Public Float                        68,210,000
Institutional ownership     71,231,759 (89.41%) (fintel 8/19)
Short interest                    (38,968,885) (41.86%) (fintel 8/19)

Weekly volume.             1,130,000,000 (14.1x shares outstanding) 


Assuming ever single short covered this week and reloaded to re-short again on Friday 8/19.    How are my trades and assignments accounted for with respect to price discovery? I.e. I had CSP’s at 18 &amp; 14, I’ve agreed to purchase actual shares at 18 &amp; 14; meanwhile there was potentially 14 times that many synthetic shares being solicited for a lessor value.

Q1) how do I determine how many days the shorts have to cover after this week?

Q2) how could naked shorting not be taking place? 

Q3) is there a way to view the volume and value of CSP’s that were assigned on Friday? When those shares are cleared wouldn’t that cause a squeeze considering the sacristy of actual shares available? 

Q4) do institutional owners generally hold certificates or direct register their shares?

My question is will these puts get exercised a 100% ? 
1) I’d like to understand what’s the logic behind whether a slightly itm put gets exercised if price is down at market close and after market. 
2) Does it matter if the option holder has enough shares of qqq or if they don’t have shares then does their brokerage account has to have enough Margin power to allow them to be short for those shares ?

Thanks all - I’d just like to understand what’s the possible outcomes or do all itm options get exercised no matter what

UPDATE : as of Saturday morning only 4 contracts of underlying got assigned to me. Conclusion is although one should prepare for being assigned 100% for itm options, however there can be reasons why they may not be assigned : - 1) the option buyer is foolish and does do not exercise order, 2) the option buyer does not have enough buying power in their account and even if he wants to exercise, their brokerage does not let them exercise those options because they fear that their client does not have margin or shares.

t3_wsok30|1660942184|options|SPY Iron Condors|"Hey all!

I'm a bit furious right now with Robinhood, but this might be an issue across the board.

So, I had a weekly 440/420 Iron Condor on SPY.  3x contracts.  $12 per contract premium = $36 total premium.  Going into today, it gets all the way down to $421, but stays there.  So, I look, thinking it'll expire worthless, and Robinhood exercised the bottom leg at $10 each contract, x 3 = $30. So they at the entire profit with that nonsense.  They claim it's a ""risk tolerance"" move and the have a ""band"" where they use that to determine if they should exercise or not.  The guy can't tell me what that band is, only it varies from stock to stock and under market conditions and I should ""adjust my trading accordingly"".  How the fuck am I supposed to do that if there's some invisible, arbitrary band?

Is this kind of thing normal across trading platforms, or just Robinhood?  Frankly, it's an insignificant amount of money, and I have small accounts on Tastyworks, Public, Webull, and TD, but I'm aggravated about this because if it was a larger amount of money, I'd be beyond furious.  I don't mind hoping over to another platform, but don't want to if it's a standard practice.

Lastly, I've debated on just doing weeklies on SPX on Tastyworks, and avoiding the drama altogether, since I'm told there's no early assignment.

It was a class I took on banking and they briefly went over options contract I didn't think too much of it and didn't really cared much. I thought derivatives were just another boring financial asset class that people used occasionally to ""shuffle money around"" and doesn't really do much for the world.

Almost a year after I got more interested into stocks and investing in general, eventually the almighty YouTube algorithm sent me a video by smb capital. I clicked on it I watched for a few seconds and then he said something a long the lines of **""Imagine if you can control the equivalent price action of 100 shares of a stock with only a fraction of the capital needed""**. That line IMMEDIATLEY got my attention, in the previous months I also happened to learn a lot about economic theory, behavioral economics and understood the concept of utility. Insurance is a critical part of the financial sector and they taught us why insurance, despite being a zero sum game provides positive value to society.

As I started to finish watching the video I understood how similar options are to insurance and casinos, except unlike insurance and casinos, call options and put options don't necessarily have negative expected monetary values over a long period of time. After that I got interested in speculation, price action, learned some trading and eventually quantitative trading. Right now I'm almost halfway through the bible of options trading ""Options Volatility and Pricing"" by Sheldon Natenburg.

Now we all know Elon tweeted about it in what he said was a joke, my investment thesis here has nothing to do with that.

Current $MANU market cap is roughly $2.2B, Chelsea recently sold for around $5B in a forced sale. Based on this alone the stock could double as the $MANU brand is more valuable than that of Chelsea, as they are the world's most popular football club. 

Even better, the BBC and Bloomberg have reported that both British Billionaire Jim Ratcliffe and Private Equity firm Apollo are interested in purchasing a stake in the club or even the entire club. This will require a hefty premium over current trading prices.

As well, option data on the stock is unquestionably bullish, with a Put/Call open interest ratio of 0.25 (4 calls for every put) and a Put/Call Volume ratio of 0.07 (14.3 calls bought for every put). Now of the $2.2B market cap, the stock only $689M (49M shares) free float, with the current owners (the Glazer family) holding the rest. This means that the stock can see explosive upwards moves on small trading volume.

As interest in an acquisition builds and solidifies, I expect to see explosive upwards moves in the stock as it gets on the radar of Wall Street merger and special situations arb traders and investors.

But say in the scenario that the funds have not settled on one transaction I just closed out, but I open another short position - whereby I wouldn't otherwise have the cash to secure my position pending the settlement.

Would this new transaction technically be borrowing money on margin? (is it broker specific, I don't know where to find this detail on schwab and e-trade).

If yes, am I getting charged a negligible amount of interest?

I know the above scenario would indicate that I have all cash funds in play on positions somehow. I actually try always have 50% cash in case I need to defend my positions or do something else. So the question is more hypothetical, but I feel important to understand when margin applies.

I've sold 20 covered calls on AMC for 8/19 at the 20 strike. There is a very good chance that these will be called away, and I am okay with that. I've made about $14k this year selling covered calls since January when I started my position, and my cost basis is 24.72 per share. Yes, I sold deep ITM covered calls to protect my downside.

My question is since the record date is August 15th (got that one), and ex-dividend date is August 19th (the day my calls will potentially be exercised) do I qualify for the APE shares?

I have done a lot of searching and heard it both ways. One group says I qualify, while the other says I don't because I will have sold before August 22nd which is the distribution date.

Does anyone have definitive information on how this will work?

With all the IV and price action since last week I was curious should I sell the calls and move on with life or should I sell a weekly call at a higher strike price (like $40 - $45), take the premium and use my $25 leap call as collateral?

I believe that second option is a poor man’s covered call and I’d have to double check how to do it in my brokerage or unsure if I would have to exercise them first.

Either way Income from selling the calls will definitely be nice but not life changing. And the 2nd option maybe makes more money in the long term or could go bust.

For example owning a stock is like a coin flip: we have 50% chance to be right (stock goes up) and 50% to be wrong (stock goes down) and viceversa if we short that stock.

In the example below instead we have a short vertical spread with 47% POP, 140$ of max profit and 110$ max loss.

[https://ibb.co/QJbjkHy](https://ibb.co/QJbjkHy)

The math behind my thinking to understand if this is a good Vertical spread or not is:

140x47-110x53= 750

This means that we have positive odds in this trade and in the long run we will always be in a good position against the uncertainty of the future.

( Not buy vs sell).

How do they differ ?  ( example below ) 

E.g. 
Verticals

1)
- sell PUT  to open AMZN $100 Strike, 21 DTE 
- buy PUT  to CLOSE AMZN $80 Strike, 21 DTE ( same DTE) 

VS

2)
- sell PUT to open AMZN $100 Strike, 21 DTE 
- buy PUT to OPEN AMZN $80 Strike, 21 DTE ( same DTE) 


At expiration for 1) and 2) --  for every outcome of stock price wouldn't the outcome be the same ?


EDIT1

- My Intention was to do 1) however I made a mistake and did 2)


- Etrade allowed me to complete the trade. I have made few trades before realizing the issue.

- whats the difference in outcome ? Between 1) and 2) does it even matter ? Since buy to and sell to is correctly setup  

****************

EDIT2 
Selling PUTs, updated the original post

*************
EDIT 3 
Made the question more specific.

*********************
**********************
SOLVED! 
I called E-Trade and got routed to their trading expert. Detailed summary below:

- ""to-open"" and ""to-close"" has no impact on the trade setup itself. 
- these are tool ( Etrade) customization and have no financial (related to options) relevance. 
- ""to-close"" is treated special. The tool will look for outstanding position on traders portfolio. The key used to look up is {DTE, Strike price}. If a matching open leg exists it'll allow ""to-close"" to go through. If it does not exists, it will not allow to proceed.
- if multiple identical open positions exits the tool will use FIFO (first in first out) to close positions. The tool will allow ""lot swap"" for the trader to override that.

- Etrade is doing away with ""to-open"" and ""to-close""
- Power Etrade platform no longer has this. 
- they asked me to move to Power Etrade. ( More stable and has all the latest updates) 

- On my setup, 1) shouldn't have gone through. 2) is correct for the intent. 

Hope this is helpful for others.

&gt; Single Listed Index Options are subject to a $0.35/contract commission in addition to any other charges for exchange, OCC and regulatory fees.

And the commission seems to be very similar to the kickback the PFOF brokerages reportedly receive per option contract[2].

Maybe PFOF brokerages don't get any kickback for Single Listed Index Option orders, because they are all filled at a single exchange?

If that's true, what are the implications of this?

Does it mean that the order fills for Single Listed Index Options on PFOF brokerages can be as good as on IBKR[3]?

According to FIRNA you have until 5:30 PM to exercise an expiring contract. Surely this has been asked before so apologies in advance. 

[https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-020321#:\~:text=FINRA%20reminds%20members%20that%20option,or%20not%20exercise%20the%20option](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-020321#:~:text=FINRA%20reminds%20members%20that%20option,or%20not%20exercise%20the%20option).

What if you have a call option for example that is for a $50 strike. 

On expiration day, the stock closes at $49. But after hours between 4PM and 5:30PM the stock moves to $51 thus putting this expiring contract technically ITM from after hours action. 

Does this mean the $50 call can be exercised? 

Long of the short, does after hours movements on expiration day affect what options can be exercised after hours or is the option to exercise purely based on what a stock closes at as of 4PM EST.

What's usually your objective? Do you use them more protectively or proactively for income? 


I'm mostly curious about income, what percent return would you consider acceptable for a monthly or weekly option? 


For example, I've been taking a conservative position in ET recently and selling weekly calls against it. On average I can collect $18-20 in premium per option, and which is a 1.5-1.7% return per week, assuming I don't get assigned.

t3_wm39aq|1660254421|options|Generating 20% profit exploiting Tesla Volatility to create iron condors|"So Tesla stock and options are scary. The options can move either way fairly fast. Worst of all, you can get screwed with IV if you hold too long. But what I’ve been doing is using spy as a barometer. When spy looks like it’s bouncing, I try to time it with Tesla’s stock dip and potential option dip to get in (usually call first) and then immediately send out a working order to sell a call against it hoping someone quickly buys it when the stock bounces up $0.50 to $0.80. I then buy a put spread with the same strike to lock in the profit. The trick is to be in and out in a minute or two. So far I get out within 10-30 seconds. There are numerous opportunities throughout the day to pile in. 

Today for example, my cost basis

Aug 26 exp

Long 865c $40.40

Short 867.5c $39.70

Long 867.5p $42.06

Short 865p $40.78

The condor basically guarantees me a profit. Or I can sell these off at different times of the day or even break them apart. I’m usually averaging $50-60 profit out of $250 or $500 per spread (so about 10 to 20% profit). Again, the profits are slim, this is all about volume. If you can do this 50 times in a day, it’ll add up. 

If you get caught and prices start dropping hard, cover your long immediately and take the loss. You might be able to recover another time but don’t play around with Tesla when the market moves against you.

It was my first time placing an order in  months and the rough cost estimate was showing close to 1000$ for the  contracts. When i went to check my account moments later I noticed my  account with a massive amount of money missing. The options that were  worth roughly $1000 I paid $32,000 for.. I felt my heart sink and rushed  to check my orders and noticed it all listing ""stock re alignment or  stock organization or something along those lines..""I immediately called  RBC and said there's nothing they can do about it. I felt sick about it  ever since. I realized that I made a mistake but upon further looking  into it i realized a discrepancy in the trade.

The  time states that I made the trade at 9:39 AM EST or 6:30 AM Pacific  Time. I never made that trade at that time... Ive made countless calls  to RBC to figure the matter out, they just always confirm that the trade  was definitely made at that time and it is not a glitch.

Anyways  I'm just wondering do I have any options here to investigate this? Or  is this just a waste of my time and i should just move on?

t3_wlxgto|1660239879|options|Trend following stock indices using LEAPS|"I've read the life cycle investing paper from Ayres and Nalebuff. They prove that historically, younger folk leveraging themselves 2X to invest in the stock market had higher returns, even in the worst case scenarios.

The cheapest and easiest way to leverage you exposure to the stock market is to buy deep in the money call LEAPS.

However, I'm not too familiar with options (even though I have been investing for years, just never bothered with reading up on derivatives much).

I wish to only maintain 2X exposure to the S&amp;P 500 when it is above say a 200 day moving average (for example). When S&amp;P 500 drops below that SMA, move to government bonds (unlevered). Then get back in the market with 2X leverage again when S&amp;P 500 moves above 200 day SMA again. 

How exactly would I carry this out in practice? I am not sure if it is as simple as buying the LEAP call when going long the market and then selling it when going to bonds. Besides, wouldn't the bid-ask spreads eat me alive? Would I have to keep rolling the option contract to maintain a 12 month time to maturity or something (as I remember options behave differently as their time to expiry decreases)?

As you can tell, I have much to learn about options. I would really appreciate someone pointing me to a few good option books that cover this sort of stuff.

t3_wlwuoe|1660238314|options|Stistcically visualize option-combo P&amp;L: with dimensions of VIX and spot-price|"If you buy an option combo on day=X1 with spot\_price=Y1, it's very difficult to calculate its price on day=X2 with spot\_price becomes Y2. Black-Scholes does not help much, because it's hard to predict the volatility on day=X2. (Neural network has been used for this task, but the precision is not satisfying)

For an estimated solution, I made many attempts to visualize option combo's P&amp;L in a statistical way; I found this one to be most useful:

1. Each L-shape is a trade of an option combo (SPX call calendar in this graph, short-leg DTE=10, long-leg DTE=20). In a span of 4 months (Aug 2018 - Nov 2018), purchase one combo on each trading day;
2. A dot on vertical line X=0 is the VIX of the purchase\_day. That's why Y-axis range is \[10, 30\], which is the common VIX range;
3. X-axis is the SPX-price change  between purchase\_day and purchase\_day+5. For example, if a combo was purchased on 8/5 with SPX=2500, and on 8/10 the SPX becomes 2560, then the change is 60/2500=2.4%, which corresponds to 2.4 on X-axis. That's also the meaning of the L-shape horizontal-arm;
4. The L-shape vertical-arm represents option combo's P&amp;L on purchase\_day+5. If it points up, it's a gain (in black); if it points down, it's a loss (in red). Longer vertical arm means more gain/loss, so they can be visually comparable.

This graph tells a lot. Besides the basic features of Calendar, it clearly indicates higher-VIX (or IV) on the purchase day is more favorable: when VIX is around 25, with SPX increases 3% in 5 days, there's still a gain. In contrast, when VIX is around 15, SPX increases 2% already showed a loss.

This analysis can be applied to all option strategies. This graph only shows purchase\_day+5. purchase\_day+N can be drawn on the same graph (with different colors) to show the P&amp;L impact from one more dimension."|0.57|3|0|3

As opposed to losing your shares?|"What’s the benefit of ever letting your shares be called away as opposed to rolling the cc? If you buy at $100 and sell a $5 cc, your break even *for this particular trade* is $105. Ok so if on expiration day for example the price is anywhere over $105, you can either let your shares get called away, or you can roll your cc. You’ve already reached max profit for this trade so why not keep your shares and roll? I don’t see how you’re losing money by choosing to roll, AND, you don’t create a tax event by selling your shares. The only advantage I can think of by letting your shares go, would be if your cc was so far itm that you couldn’t roll without losing money. But even if all you could do was break even by rolling, you still have that share growth and you still have your shares/dividends/less tax events.

Yes I know this might not necessarily be the best route to go, BUT I do want to understand it better and want to learn more. 

Since I bought back at a loss and with rolling covered calls most are wash sales I believe as we sell another right away. I think...  So, I now would have a call I sold for $2400, and if it goes to zero and expires worthless at a later date, I'd have a gain of $2400, although in reality I made much less since I had to buy the previous call back.

So I'd have a higher tax bill to make this trade not worthwhile? Or are covered calls that we roll out taxed differently?

If this were in an IRA it wouldn't matter since all trades in there are not taxed until withdrawn. oh well.

And while they are pretty darn efficient, they aren’t as immaculate as I thought. A few years ago I started studying variance premium and in an offshoot, tested a strategy in index ETFs (SPY, QQQ, IWM) where I’d sell theta on Friday’s mid morning at the earliest expiration for the next week. I tested neutral and directional short theta trades with neutral outperforming. Risk was managed at 2.5x credit received. If there was a weekend move, I hedged with futures as needed although was rare. 

I was originally under the impression that the markets accurately priced in the weekend decay, but they don’t. 

After my relatively small data set of ~100 trades I did some broader research to see if anyone else studied the effect. Turns out, they did (stupid me, should’ve looked for that first). 

Jones and Shemesh (2017) studied this exact phenomenon and found a similar result from 1996 - 2007. The average weekend return was negative around half a point while all other days were slightly positive at around a quarter point. The effect was amplified over holiday weekends. Their prevailing thought was it’s tied to non-trading. 

I’m still running my data set but since there’s a legit study documenting the phenomenon I figured I’d share here for y’all to checkout too."|0.63|2|0|2

t3_wjktsy|1659994319|options|Should I close my 40$ DOCN 16 Dec position?|"
Hello guys, I am an option newbie. Today was the earnings release and it surpassed estimation of 0.10$ EPS with an actual EPS of 0.20$.  Current stock value is around 48$ and I have already had good ROI. But I think that the stock is pretty undervalued and will go a bit higher. I do understand that theta decay and IV will eat up the premium but since the intrinsic value might still be strong, should I wait till maturity?"|0.75|4|0|4
t3_wjjjk8|1659991221|options|Are margin loans a better means of attaining leverage than LEAPS?|"I am using the ""Lifecycle Investing"" strategy proposed by Barry Nalebuff and Ian Ayres in their book of the same name, which states that one should use 2:1 leverage for the first few years of their career as a long term investment strategy. The way they suggest doing this is by buying index funds like SPY with margin loans and LEAPS, among other means. I am currently trying to determine which of the first two is the better option by calculating which of those two would require the lowest stock price change to break even.

Let's say I had $10,000, and I put it in SPY with no leverage. Since SPY has a 30-day yield of 1.42, we may assume that the dividend returns would be 1.42% over then next year, so the stock price could fall by 100-100×(1/1.0142)=1.4% (-1.4% change) and you would still break even because of the dividend. Since I use robinhood (pls don't hate), if I want to use 2:1 leverage through margin loans, I can borrow $10,000 to buy SPY, on top of the $10,000 I own with my money. The margin interest rate is 5% right now, which is calculated by adding 2.5% to the target federal funds rate, which will also go up to decrease inflation. Assuming it stays the same however, the price change for SPY to reach break-even with margin loans, would be (5-(2x1.42))/2=1.08%. I pretty much took the interest rate, subtracted from it the 30-day yield times 2, because now we get twice as many dividends because we have twice as many shares, and then divided that result by 2 because we also get double the gains for the same change in price. Furthermore, we can also attain 2:1 leverage by buying a $205 9/23 SPY Call. SPY is currently priced at $413, and that call's ask price is $214, meaning that SPY's break-even price change in this case would be ((205+214)/413-1)×100=1.45%. Since you miss out on dividends with calls, we don't need to consider them here.

According to my methodology, and please correct  me if it is wrong, margin loans appear to be the superior option, especially for someone like me who is young and has a smaller account. The margin interest rate would need to go up by another .74% for the margin loan approach to have the same break-even point as the LEAP approach. You might say that's likely to happen given more future rate hikes by the federal reserve. But even then, each one of those calls costs $21,400, and thus this approach requires at least that much money, if not way more, to successfully implement. Finally, as prices fluctuate, your leverage will too. If I used the margin loan approach mentioned earlier and SPY fell by 25%, I would end up with $15,000 worth of SPY shares. Since I have $10,000 in loans, of that $15,000, only $5,000 would be mine, and therefore I would have 3:1 leverage. I would thus need to rebalance by selling stock to pay off my loans as the price goes down, and take out loans to buy more stock as the price goes up, to retain 2:1 leverage. The LEAP approach also requires rebalancing, but since each LEAP is ~$20K, you would actually need a lot more money than that to rebalance. Are there any factors that I have overlooked, or is the margin approach simply better?"|0.82|37|0|37

I hold a so called ""optionsschein"" wich is quite similar to european options with minor but for this case unimportant differences.

I've bought 162.5C011624 (strike in usd) a while ago (in Euro with the underlying given in Euro too) (isin DE000TT45RT4) a while ago and with currently ~15% profit. It has been about 50% but I totally got fucked today and I bite my ass that I haven't sold before market open b/c the sideways trading seemed suspicious.

So what would your strategy be? The long expiration is a clear sign to hold it but the weak outlook presented today and a imminent recession makes me uncertain.

I have little experience trading this products and ask you about your opinion what you would do and why.

I know that they aren't options in the sub's sense but I think a question is feasible since they have similar mechanisms.

Anyway my account is a cash only with them, I have just under $2000 on there, when I load in money ,I spend it, options etc so virtually leaving just under $50 spare.

Now I received that message from ibkr which is puzzling me because usually call options are you just loose the price paid!

I've never had a warning message off them before, that was until now, very strange.

My question is ....
If and when $Vix does shoot up during  a crash, will i lose everything in my account stocks other options etc for margin (ibkr notice says upto 60% despite being a cash account, no margin ? 🤔

From my understanding, options are essentially bets you make for a certain security to be a certain price. If it's not at that price, you lose it all(what you paid for the option). If it is, you make a lot more than if you just bought the stock normally

To me that seems very risky but my friend said that you can minimize the risk by using hedging, resulting in a risk that's similar to investing in index funds etc but at a greater return, 25% as opposed to 10%

So I'm thinking of approximately creating options through pure delta hedging, using one of the common options models.

I don't mind the jump risks / gamma that I'd be risking - the net delta risk will be much higher than other greeks anyway (most of the time). My entire synthetic options portfolio will be roughly market neutral (long ""puts"" delta and long ""calls"" delta) to hedge for a market jump.

Lastly, I was an options dealer many moons ago, so I understand the black swans that could devastate the hedge.

My questions are  -

1) Have any of you bright folks tried this already? Your experience would be appreciated.

2) I'll be placing hedges every 10 delta. Does that granularity suffice?

3) I'll be using my estimate of expected implied vol, but your feedback is appreciated!

To summarize, I'm getting sick of option unavailability on stocks situations where I see a clear edge. My goal is to roughly approximate a portfolio of options for a small part of my portfolio, and your priceless advice is appreciated!

t3_win5ix|1659898719|options|Is this realistic?|So basically I recently decided to aim for 10% daily gains. Up until now I have just been getting into trades with the hopes of doubling my money or even seeing gains larger than 100%. That led to me making a lot of money, and then losing it soon after because I’d be in disbelief that the play didn’t work out and end up losing any gains I’ve made as well as some of my initial investment, or something along those lines. As of recent I’ve been trying to find a way to be more consistent, I came to the conclusion that my profit target and greed were the main issues with my trading. I say this because most of the trades that I get into are profitable just not the profits I want to see at that time. 10% is really not that hard to make, I know I can do this daily and have done so last week. Again however, greed started to play a role and I screwed up a few trades after seeing my profit target (10%) and still holding hoping to get a big bagger. I’m pretty much certain that if I get my shit together I can do this but anytime I bring it up to other people whether they are in the market or not they say that it’s well impossible and that doing that would make me “a better trader than wArReN bUfFetT” which they’re sure I’m not. I’m 18 and have been trading options since I was 16, I’d like to know if some of you older/ more experienced degenerates think this is a realistic goal. Or if I’m just some dumb kid that kept getting lucky and has a rude awakening in store. I believe in myself but the amount of people that say otherwise makes me 2nd guess my approach to trading sometimes.|0.35|0|0|0
t3_win0o0|1659898354|options|I might have just created a brilliant strategy|"Okay, so this all started when I wanted to dip my feet into the wild-west of volatility arbitrage. There isn't much practical literature around on it, but the core concept was simple: eliminate exposure to all other greeks, and profit from changes in volatility. So over the past few months, I started exploring and eventually started trading a strategy that I haven't seen anywhere else, so here it goes. 

**Background**

We all know that the market likes Black-Scholes, but Black-Scholes lacks in some important ways, the biggest ones being that it doesn't account for dividends, large price moves, or most importantly, the expiration risk premium. Since Black-Scholes are for European options, it doesn't factor in that the option can be exercised at any time. However, market prices do account for this extra risk, and it is a large reason why if you price an option with Black-Scholes, the market price and calculated price will be pretty far off. 

Luckily, the Barone-Adesi and Whaley (BAW) model captures this extra risk perfectly by adding a slight tweak to the Black-Scholes model. Without going into the granularity of differential equations, the BAW model accounts for the risk that the option can be exercised at any time and adds that value to the Black-Scholes value. It isn't mandatory to know it's formulaic derivation, but [here](https://ir.nctu.edu.tw/bitstream/11536/14182/1/000264318900005.pdf) is a research paper reference for those interested. 

In case you didn't know, implied volatility is just a variable that is backed out from the Black-Scholes model. So, all things considered, we are also able to back out implied volatility from the BAW model, except this IV will be more efficient and accurate. Our profit comes from collecting the spread of:

**Calculated IV** \- **Market IV** = **Profit**

Great, we have an efficient measure of IV! Only, how the hell do we target this? I'm retail just like you, so the options like replicating a variance swap or hedging a short call are just way out of my price range. This capital limit restricts this strategy to only going long volatility. When you lock into a defined-risk straddle, betting that IV will increase, delta-hedging becomes extraordinarily cheap. It sounds scary and expensive, but as you'll see below, it really isn't. 

**Strategy**

Okay, so we know that we can only trade if we're expecting IV to go up. So first, we have to find options that meet that criteria. There are a lot of ways to determine these stocks, you can use upcoming earnings for example, but I personally go with the following 

* Have an IV at least 5% lower than the 20-day historical IV
* Are no more than 5% out-of-the-money
* Expire in less than 30 days

I use the OpenBB screener with those parameters and get the following output:

Now, let's check if the IV is right. I first plug the call values into the BAW model and back-out IV using the bisection method (research paper [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504850701591325?journalCode=rael20)). 

https://preview.redd.it/vzm2p6jh6cg91.png?width=988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6e91c8a702c8ff6465006a35b39afc45c160c39

As pictured, the IV of the call according to the BAW model is in actuality about 5% higher than that quoted by the market. When pricing the put, the IV is about 3% higher. 

Now, it's clear what needs to happen. I must long these two positions and hedge my delta so that I make money if IV goes up. The fun begins. 

I buy the call and put for a net cost of $765. When the order is filled, the starting delta is 2.48. 

https://preview.redd.it/te6zvfxc6cg91.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cb43caf3ccb344e81b4922b64b7d02526ec23fa

This means that for each dollar the stock moves, the position makes/loses \~$2. We do not want that risk. We want our delta to be neutral, so we short 2 shares of AAPL. 

https://preview.redd.it/et3jbfkd6cg91.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6890273e771471677b945a3b744c565554e0b6cc

That's it. That's all delta-hedging is. Over the lifespan of the option and over the day, the deltas will oscillate up and down, but for a stock like AAPL, this range is typically small, only requiring you to hedge a few times in either direction. 

Now that the position is delta-hedged, you are exposed to just the change in volatility (gamma too, but since you're dynamically hedging, it isn't a significant risk).

**Profit**

As expected, the IV of the position increased. By 10 minutes before market close, the implied vol of the call increased from 21% to 27%, and the implied vol of the put increased from 21% to 24%. This allowed me to sell the call for 495 and the put for 435, for a total of 930 ($165 profit).

t3_wh5pho|1659731866|options|Disadvantages of closing the put leg of a deep ITM synthetic long?|"TLDR - Are there any besides the capital it takes to do so and associated tax liabilities?

I setup up a (paper traded) synthetic long of $AAPL last year with 145 strikes for Jan ‘24.

Obviously, it’s not yet “deep” ITM, but the position has bounced back from a rough patch earlier this year, with the underlying up about 14%. The put option is currently sitting at a delta of -.27.

This got me thinking about longterm synthetic strategies and whether it makes sense to buy back put positions if the underlying stock price continues to grow.

Say $AAPL pops another 15% and the put delta drops to -.15. At that point, the call option is by far the major driver of profits for the position overall and the put is the major liability.

Since it’s no longer driving profits and could be closed for about a quarter of the premium realized when I opened it, would it make sense to just close out that leg and continue to let everything ride on the call leg?

I realize doing so would contradict the bullish thesis keeping the call open is founded on, but given the risk/reward ratio for the put at that point, it seems reasonable. It would also open up a significant amount of margin ($14,500) to get rid of the position.

Are there downsides I’m not realizing besides the capital and tax implications to this sort of play?"|0.67|4|0|4

The premiums on SOXL are much better - which I pressume is because it is a 3X and either because of that - or in spite of it? - the strikes have much higher IV. This lead me to do more digging and it seems true that leveraged ETFs have higher IV, than their 1X counterparts and thus higher premiums.

Given that I am dynamically delta hedging these (readjust when deltas get to +- 10) I believe I am correct in not being too concerned about the direction of these leveraged ETFs (is this a sound assumption?). Leveraged ETFs as a long term investment get a bad rep for being too directionally unpredictable and the mathematics seems to lead to their inevitiable decline. However, am I exposing myself to any new or greater risks by doing a short straddle on a 3X vs a 1X ETF **given that I am delta hedged**?

t3_wfmpma|1659572630|options|data for credit spreads?|"First things first, this is simply data I came away with, shouldn’t be used for making any decisions.

This information is based off of the last year of data for SPY (numbers from yahoo finance). 

Some context: I have 3 different ways I broke down the data: open, highs, lows, close. &lt;0 difference is considered a win. &gt;0 is considered a loss. you would “win” doing a credit spread. With the credit spread I’m assuming you’re like 6-7 dollars OTM, thus theta would do a lot good for you, helping you win even with SPY being up a little. All assuming you buy right around EOD close and exit the next day.

The 3 ways are: worst cases scenario, “perfect world” setup, and close to close.

IMPORTANT: keep in mind there’s a lot that goes into this. Price could mess you up off open since no theta helped you yet or theta could save you a bit and the high comes EOD and theta helped a lot with your losses. Also, I’m aware you would never sell the exact high or low of the day. The point being if the contract “technically” wins then you had a point to take profit, even if it wasn’t for a majority of your credit. Also keep in mind the market hasn’t been up a bull market the whole last year. 

First up is worst case. Worst case scenario would be previous day close to next days high. Example: today is august 3rd. On august 2nd you would have entered end of day at roughly 408.06. The high today was 415.68. Since we are in call credit spreads that’s a loss. That’s the worst possible outcome. That’s a 15% win rate.

Next is “perfect scenario”. That is previous day close (your entry) based off of next days low. Credit spread so we want price to move downwards. Example: you buy in yesterday at close (august 2nd) at 408.06. Then todays low was 410. That’s 1.94 change, so a loss. I actually did this today and it was a $2 loss per contract. Like I said before, you won’t sell the bottom. Technically, you had a window of opportunity to either sell or start scaling profits. That’s a 78.97% win rate. 

Next up is close to close. Just like before but at close (example: august 2nd at 408.06 and then todays close 414.45) a loss. Remember I’m assuming we are in credit spreads, so want price to stay down. This has a 48.8% win rate.

I guess at the end of the day you have a 78.97% chance to “win” every day based off this last years of data.

Again, this doesn’t help prove if the spread actually won. I don’t have exact charts to plot highs or lows or account for cutting losses that could also win. In theory, wouldn’t a 80% win rate be great? Saying you aim for 10% profit, or $10 credit. Hypothetically would gain $60 )not accounting for buying to close) over the course of 10 trades, with 1 spread- or 60%. 8 of 10 trades win and then assuming $10 loss 2 of 10 is 80-20= 60."|0.62|3|0|3

You've probably heard the phrase ""bad habits,"" but what do we really mean by that? Is there a list of bad habits that we can all agree on? The answer is yes! In fact, I'm sure you could come up with your own list of bad financial habits. However, I've got mine right here:

## Option traders are overconfident.

Overconfidence is a dangerous thing to have in the trading world. It can lead you to make poor decisions, such as taking on too much risk or not following your trading plan. It's like a disease that affects all traders at some point during their careers, so it's important to know how to recognize it and stop yourself from going down the same path as others who have come before you.

Here are some symptoms of overconfidence:

* You think you're smarter than everyone else in the market.
* You don't follow any sort of strategy when making trades (or even worse—you don't have one).
* Your losses don't bother you because they were ""just paper losses."" They only count once they hit your account balance!

## Option traders aren't patient.

So how do you become a more patient trader? Well, the first step is to realize that patience is a virtue. And like all virtues, it can be learned through practice and discipline.

There's no magic bullet to develop patience as an option trader because patience is more of a skill than a specific trait you're born with or not. It's also important to understand that patience is something you choose when faced with an uncomfortable situation; it's not something that happens automatically just because you want it to happen.

So if you're lacking in this department (like most people are), here are some things you can do:

## Many option traders don't understand options.

Most option traders don't understand options. They think of them as stocks and not contracts, but in reality options are contracts that provide the buyer with the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a given date.

Options can be used to hedge risk, speculate, generate income and generate leverage.

## Option traders don't work hard enough.

So, you want to be an option trader.

You think it will be easy, because all you have to do is choose whether to buy or sell a stock at a given price by a certain date. Then sit back and wait for the money to roll in.

But here’s the thing: option trading is not easy. It takes time and effort—and more than that, it takes discipline. If you’re lazy and sloppy with your approach, then even if you get lucky and make some money, chances are high that it won’t last long before you lose everything again (and maybe even more than once).

## Option traders underestimate risk.

The number one reason that option traders lose money is because they underestimate risk.

Risk means the chance that you will lose money in an investment. It’s an important factor to consider when trading options because there are many ways you can lose money.

Option traders often ignore their risk level, which can cause them to trade with too much risk or with no risk at all. They may also fail to manage their risk levels properly leading to larger losses than necessary.

## Option traders lack discipline.

Discipline is the most important trait any trader can have. Discipline is the ability to stay focused on your trading plan and execute it consistently day after day, week after week, month after month. Without discipline you will not make money in the markets. You may find yourself making excuses for why you missed an entry or exited a trade too early or too late: ""I was busy at work,"" ""My kid's school closed due to weather,"" ""I was sick."" The excuses are endless but they won't get you anywhere.

The best way to develop discipline as an option trader is by having a written trading plan that includes specific rules for entering and exiting trades as well as other aspects of your trading strategy such as risk management strategies, time frames used when placing trades and more importantly how much capital (money) will be risked in each trade based on what kind of account type it is being placed into such as margin accounts vs non-margin accounts etc...

## Option traders don't keep their emotions in check.

There's no reason to get emotional about your trading. When you're feeling emotional, you start making irrational decisions and lose focus on the task at hand. Instead of losing money by reacting inappropriately, keep your emotions in check so you can make informed and calculated trades that are likely to succeed. If a trade loses money, don't take it personally—it's just part of the game!

## Some habits are worse than others.

Some habits are worse than others. Some are good, some bad. Some habits are more important than others, and some aren't so important after all.

Let's look at an example of a common trading mistake: not knowing what you're doing in the first place. This can happen when traders fail to understand their strategy or don't have a firm grasp on how options work (or both). When this happens, they tend to behave erratically or impulsively instead of following the rules they set out for themselves in advance—which is never a good idea!

Another bad habit is trading too much when there's no reason for it—especially if that reason is just because ""I thought I could make some money."" Sure, it might work sometimes—but it will also often lead to losses that could have been avoided if the decision had been approached differently from the start

## Conclusion

We hope this post has helped you identify some of the worst habits of option traders. Remember that these are just 7 common habits, and there are many others out there. You can improve your trading by noticing when you fall into one or more of these traps and then taking steps to correct them."|0.55|5|0|5

I have given up hope that the fund will be liquidated before my puts expire and need to move them to a broker where I can exercise the options and enter a short position. Robinhood does not allow customers to enter a short position, and WeBull has informed me that they would deny transfer of these contracts because of their restricted nature.

Assuming that the status quo holds and the stock will remain untradeable, what can I do with these contracts? Is there a broker who will let me transfer the contracts in and enter a short position? Is there any way to LEGALLY sell these contracts?

I won't be ruined if these options expire, but I would feel dumb leaving money on the table.

t3_we03bz|1659408280|options|I started trading the wheel. Looking for critiques of my trading rules.|"Sorry for long post. I was going to ask this in the weekly questions safe haven thread, but after typing it decided it's a bit meaty for that. I can move it there if need be, or to another subreddit if it'd be more at home somewhere else.

I've been learning about options for over a year now and have done some paper trading on them for a while. I really like the wheel strategy for multiple reasons (if any of you don't recommend it I'd like to hear why below, but ultimately that's not what this is about). My only problem is I prefer to have a fairly rigid set of rules before going into a position, and the rules I currently operate by are mostly self-formulated (with guidance from bits of knowledge I've heard in my searches). That's fine, but I want to open them up to critique. So I'll leave my personally dictated guidelines below, please leave your thoughts so I can advance as a trader.

So once I pick the underlying I want to run the wheel on, I start with a cash secured put. To guide the expiration and strike of the option I sell, I usually go 25-45 days to expiration and look for contracts with a delta of around -0.3 based on loose advice I've heard around. I look at the available contracts in that range and pick one basically based on Dollars Per Day (DPD). I like to go for the closer to expiration ones because theta decay turns a profit more quickly, but the up-front payouts of the further out contracts sometimes seem enticing, despite having a lower return per day. I usually only end up with \~45 DTE positions as a result of rolling, as described below.

I have a hard time with rolling. I'm typically not scared of being assigned on the wheel and would prefer to just wait out the price action and hope for the price to go OTM on its own and not have to worry about rolling out and tying my collateral up for longer. If I have to roll out beyond 45 DTE I typically don't bother and just let myself be assigned if that's how it's going. I guess I could use some rolling tips if you have any, as I know I don't use this portion of its strategy to its fullest extent. I just don't like my collateral being tied up in a contract longer than 45 days without collecting more premiums. I'd rather be assigned and just start selling CCs for full premiums than get a $3 credit to tie my money up for another 3 months or until the price goes favorable to me.

If price action lowers the value of the put option to 1/2 of what it was when I sold it prior to 14 DTE, I'll close the position and begin looking for another CSP entry point on a separate strike. If I'm still above 1/2 cost at 14 DTE I'll just hold the option to expiration. Typically it's only in the latter situations that I roll, as price action might might push the option ITM in a situation where I can roll down-and-out for a credit, and I'll usually do that so long as I don't have to go &gt;45 DTE.

Ultimately, once assigned, I'll start doing Covered Calls (CCs) on the shares put into my portfolio. I'll basically use the same criteria to trade covered calls: 25-45 DTE with a 0.3 delta, focusing on DPD for the trade. Close positions further than 14 DTE if at &gt;1/2 profit, otherwise hold to expiry. Only roll if you can roll for credit with &lt;45 DTE in the new position, otherwise wait for price action/assignment. The only exception here is to watch the strike price I'm selling my contracts at and make sure I'm making a profit I'm comfortable with, otherwise I'll probably hold the stock. I'm bull-headed about finishing my trades in the black to a fault. There are times I refuse to even sell a CC on my shares unless I can sell with a strike above where I bought at. I only trade on stocks I'd be okay with holding so being stubborn with the CCs usually comes natural to me.

Anyways, sorry for the wordy explanations and stuff. Thanks to anyone who offers advice."|0.7|7|0|7

If I were to YOLO it all on options, what would be the highest chance of profit for a controlled payout. So to get the spirit and the depth of the problem, consider the following puzzle first..

# Roulette puzzle

You're sitting at a no-limit (European/single zero) roulette table with 100$ million of borrowed money from the mafia. In 12 hours, you have to give it all back. If any amount is missing, you're dead. But any extra money you made gambling, you get to keep. What do you do?

You can just do nothing. 100% you get to live and make 0$.

You could gamble it all on red. 48.6% you walk away with 100$ million, 51.4% you're dead. A coinflip basically.

You could play some Martingale systems to try and limit the risk, etc. So say we are not greedy, we just want to make X% return on the money with the least amount of risk. If you spend some time working out the math, you'll find that:

* it's best to risk it all on one spin of the wheel (Martingale systems with repeated betting have lower EV as they require multiple wheel spins)
* one of the optimal solutions is betting on N numbers out of 35 with equal amounts; for example, you could bet on all numbers except the zero and say, 13 (you're betting on 34 numbers total); if any of your numbers land, you'd get a 1:35 payout, or 2.94% profit (or \~3$ million ;) - with a 94.4% probability

The point being, while this is a YOLO, it doesn't have to be a double or nothing situation; it is possible to set it up as a low return, high win chance gamble.

# Same but with options

We will assume options are priced fairly (meaning, we expect to have 0 expected value for all dates and expirations, whether we buy it or sell it). Ie: we would expect to make 0$ by randomly buying/selling options.

We also want to efficiently utilize leverage/margin. In the roulette puzzle, the winnings came from leveraging someone else's money in order to win big. So while selling 1 delta calls or puts is close to 99% winrate for a tiny profit, it is likely not the highest return that we can achieve for the same margin.

To keep it simple, say we want to make 10% on a SPY play while maximizing the chance of success. We are willing to loose it all if necessary. What is the upper bound on the probability of success on such a play?

It's a heavy math problem, so I don't blame anyone who finds it boring :) But let's explore some options.

**Naked OTM short calls/puts:**

The problem here is low margin utilization. Depending on the volatility of the underlying, we can get liquidated long before expiry. So we need to focus on spreads if we want to efficiently utilize max leverage.

**Iron condor:**

The good thing about this play that it has max defined loss, fixed profit. So for starters, here's a 40DTE SPY play, \~10 delta short, \~4 delta long legs:

[40DTE, 15&amp;#37; return on capital risked, 82&amp;#37; chance of profit](https://preview.redd.it/cxn1zrdyq5f91.png?width=1230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ebec78d4d06bd992fee0feaeb8a5012a64199e9)

Similar setups could be made with for any DTE, but the general issue is the same: Those long legs are a waste of premium. They are necessary so that your broker lets you leverage up this trade by capping the loss, but they eat into our profits. After all, once your short leg is breached, you're likely screwed anyway. You can still hang on to the trade in hopes of it swinging around in your favor, but we're essentially sitting ducks.

I've been playing with different setups, but for a 10% return, best case scenario is about 88% chance of profit. Note that the theoretical upper bound is 90.9% (with some math, it is easy to see that if all options are assumed to have 0 EV, any combination of these options is also 0 EV; so if you hit 10% return with probability x, but loose it all with probability 1-x, if EV is 0, x=0.909).

**But there's margin..**

I have a strong feeling iron condors are about as good as it gets. But margin accounts, depending on the brokerage and the funds deposited, can leverage such a trade by up to 4x. So using the Iron Condor from the previous example, with 4x leverage, we'd be looking at 60% return, but taking on slightly more risk by likely getting instantly liquidated when the short legs are approached/breached.

But all in all, taking on margin actually greatly improves the achievable risk/reward profiles, if you're planning to go risk it all in the first place anyway.

**Conclusion?**

There isn't any. Options and roulettes aren't that different, if you're just blindly making picks.

I obviously don't recommend YOLOs to anyone, but it is an entertaining idea to think about what would a high probability of success yolo would in fact look like. If anyone has better ideas, I'm curious."|0.81|15|0|15

**Intro**

Some of you may remember me from my series of posts that are now \~155 days old at the time of writing this. I provide a link to the original post I made below. Today I want to present to you guys the results of my Beta test with cash plays. Before getting into it I think we should briefly look at the general market conditions before explaining my beta test:

The results from this test run from 2/4/22-7/19/22 or about 5 months.

In a 6-month period SPY is down 8.91%(at the time of writing this post)

In a 6-month period QQQ is down 13.06% &amp; the DOW is down 15.35%

**Test Setup:**

A quick refresher for those that may be new. I developed a bot that looks at all stocks that have weekly options available and flags stocks that it believes has a high probability of reverting to the mean (or average price over the last 30 days or so). Following extensive paper trading tests with the bot (see previous posts here: [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/t2f4dm/spotting_stock_reversal_trends/)). I launched into a $400 beta test following some of the plays the bot suggested.

**Standard Operating Procedure/ Rules of the test:**

\-At any one time my account could have at most $400 worth of credit spreads open at any one time. If there were losses extra money was injected to keep the allocation at $400. All wins were paid out and NOT reinvested. The total cash invested ended up being $662.40, but at any given time the deployed capital was never more than $400.

\-Upon the bot flagging a play, a manual review for earnings or random news was conducted. If heavy news or earnings were coming the play was discarded.

\-If the play passed then I opened a .30 delta credit spread with a width of 1pt.

\-Upon opening a GTC order was opened for 75% of the max profit on the spread.

**Results**

Over 165 days I put on 31 plays based on the bot's recommendations. Of those 31 plays, 26 were wins and 5 were losses. The overall profit and loss of the plays are $146.90. Which gives us an ROI of 22.18% (146.90/662.40). Here is a link to a public spreadsheet that contains the paper trades from Alpha testing and now cash trades from Beta Testing.

[Spreadsheet of Plays](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vNj8-RLJmdaloQUqOjToDlZkcyEtlPg0m9HT1mqSzeE/edit?usp=sharing)

**Reflection and Analysis**

I think overall the Beta test went very well given the average decline of the market over the same time period. Some notes on the plays I recorded $CF was a gas play whilst Putin decided to invade Ukraine. and would've otherwise won, but serves as an important lesson to look at the macro industry for the stocks you open plays on. The other error was the last play on this list (CCJ) of which I didn't check if it had earnings coming up like I usually did. A final note is that on line 12 of the spreadsheet you can see a spread that was not 1pt in width, but 2.5pts this was from a friend testing out the bot while I was away.

Going forward in the second round of Beta testing(which I have already started) I will look at readjusting the risk-to-reward ratio to get it closer to a 1:1 instead of the 1:3-4 ratio I am getting currently.

t3_wdksz1|1659369130|options|Dividend risk for vertical spread|I’m looking into entering a short call spread on $ZIM. The company currently pays a 44.73% dividend due to revenue skyrocketing because of high shipping rates. I believe the stock’s price is elevated because of the high dividend, and I think the dividend will go down as shipping rates decrease.

t3_wdhw00|1659361551|options|"MSOS: ""High"" Option Premiums"|"# In this post, I talk about the MSOS trade I'm in, and the reasons I believe this trade is profitable.

Of course, I encourage all readers to do some research before making trades of their own.

**MSOS is the AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF.** 

The ETF has an implied volatility of 77% as of Friday, even though the actual volatility of the stock hasn't been higher than 60% in the last year. Option premiums are much higher than they're supposed to be.

# There are several reasons implied volatility is so high:

\- The US government is considering legalising marijuana, which would cause stocks such as MSOS to shoot up. It's similar to how IV is so high before a earnings event, but we know that options are typically overpriced during earnings.

\- MSOS has fallen from $35 - $38 to $11.66 over the last year. Most traders probably aren't selling puts on this stock now, and many traders seem like they're allergic to selling calls in general.

**This is a situation where there's potentially much more demand than supply for MSOS options, pushing their prices up.**

# How can we trade this? 

We can sell ATM MSOS straddles. A straddle maximises the theta we'll collect while MSOS continues to see relatively low levels of volatility compared to IV. Even if MSOS jumps on legalization news, this would cause IV to fall, crushing the value of the options we sold. We make a ton in theta every day nothing happens, and even after legalization, IV crush works in our favour.

**Managing The Trade**

If the price of the ETF falls, our straddles will have a positive delta. This means we can lose money if the stock price continues downwards. We can manage this risk by either closing our trade and selling new ATM straddles, or shorting the stock to delta hedge."|0.72|18|0|18

t3_wdf4bf|1659353423|options|Questions related to stoploss in options and risk management|" I have few questions related to trading. Request your help/suggestions.  


**1. Options SL based on delta**  
Say, my risk is $100 per trade  
In equity, for this risk, we can calculate number of shares based on the stoploss (let's assume we have sufficient capital)  
Eg.: SL is $2, then number of shares = 50 (i.e., $100/$2)  
This is difficult in options because of lot size. For the sake of simplicity, lets assume all the Greeks are constant. If the lot size is 100, then I can only take a risk of $1 in the option. This will make our $2 SL in underlying stock to $1 in option pricing, if we buy 0.5 delta.   
Suppose SL in underlying is $4, we can buy 25 shares and still take the same risk of $100. Now, in terms of options, for 0.5 delta, our SL becomes $2. This multiplied by lot size exposes us to a risk of $200. In this case, to keep the risk at $100, *is it ok to buy 0.25 delta option?* 

**2. Risk for total positions vs single position**  
Say, my risk is $100 per trade and I have 3 positions running. If all trades go against me, I will take a loss of $300 for the day.  
Instead of setting strict SL order for each position, what if I close all the position when the total loss reaches $300? *Is this a good risk management?*  
The reason being, profit in one trade may give some relaxation to the other trade in case its SL is reached and then bounces back.   
However, this will deviate from the ""risk per trade"" mechanism and only limits the risk per day."|0.5|0|0|0

### In the News

In early July when Tesla (TSLA) stock was trading around $680, we looked at how options were pricing the upcoming month that included an earnings event. Tesla is a stock that has tended to move alot more than options are pricing when it gets moving (both higher and lower) over the past year.

&gt;TSLA stock is trading near the same price of a year ago and is down about 45% from its all time highs above $1200. Options, which have underpriced moves in the stock (higher and lower) during its large swings of the past year are now pricing about a 15% move for the rest of July and about a 35% move by year end.

That 15% move by end of July was pricing a bullish consensus of about $780 in the stock. With this move higher Tesla actually ended July at $890, +$110 above what options were pricing at the time.

After the move higher Tesla options are pricing about 10% for August, which would put the stock near $800 or $1000:

Hello everyone,

I'm considering to carry out a bear put strategy and I have a question on how to broaden my profit range.

Let me play out the scenario:

Ill buy one ATM put at $95 as the first leg of the strategy. Now, the second legs involves selling an OTM put at a lower strike price. In case the stock does fall, the potential profit range corresponds to the difference between strike price of the long put and the short put.

I could sell an OTM put at $90 and ensure a $500 profit if the stock does fall. To increase the profit range I could sell an OTM put at a lower strike price, such as $85.

or

I could buy multiple contracts for the both the long ATM put at $95 and sell multiple contracts for the OTM put at $90.

My intutions tells me that this second option would imply less risk than simply widening the gap between strike prices.

Does this make sense? or am I missing something?

Thanks in advance."|0.67|1|0|1

t3_wcqowa|1659279602|options|Paradox of IV: My encounter..|"Hi,

Although I have read alot about options for the past few months and done a couple of trades demo and then live, I still consider myself a novice as there's really alot to learn and I am still learning. My main method is the wheel strategy. However I am also interested to try out LEAPS/PMCC.

And this is what I have observed/learnt for the IVs- I might be wrong.

1. IVs are high when prices are crashing or near to major financial events - eg company earnings
2. IVs are low when prices are rising.
3. It's better to sell options when IVs are high
4. It's better to buy options when IVs are low

My first question is, 1) for buying LEAPS- a call option in essence, if we buy it when IVs are low, we are paying lesser for the premium but that usually only happens when the underlying stock price is high, is it worth it to wait for low IV to buy LEAPS?

Which brings me to my next question 2) to execute PMCC, I have to buy a LEAPS and then SELL a CC. And selling a CC is not a bullish move, thus it is best to sell it at the top/resistance, however when prices rises, IV will be low, but you will enter it at a position as it's at resistance.

Even with a defined trading plan and regimented approach, the unexpected can and will happen. Often we see posts about where someone is complaining because of a loss caused by a risk they didn't understand or just plain bad luck. 

For fun, however, I thought I would make this thread where we could post the opposite: **One or more trades this month that did not play out as you anticipated, but you benefited from the result**. 

\-----------

I will start. I have been wheeling a small position in Petros Pharmaceuticals. On Thursday I saw a news article that it was being bought out for $3.25 and the stock was halted. Yay-max profit! But then, an hour later, the stock had collapsed back to like $.80. Turns out the press release of the buyout was fraud. Oh well. 

The next morning, I get a notification: All my short calls were assigned and my shares have been called away. Max profit! Why someone exercised the calls against my shares, I have no idea. But I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.

t3_waw0jb|1659071748|options|Efficient portfolio growth|"As my portfolio has grown over the past 15 years, there are a few distinct trends that I’ve noticed and wish I had understood earlier.

-Simple is often better. Early on I felt I needed to trade all sorts of complex strategies to maximize returns - this has proven to be the exact opposite.
-Verticals aren’t as great as you think. The markets aren’t built for small capital, they’re build for large. Verticals can be effective for some, but for me they were the means to death by 1000 papercuts on a negatively expectant strategy. Before you place your next vertical spread, check the pricing and the expectancy. I was frustrated when I found out most of what I traded was negatively expectant. I found leaving them as soon as possible enhanced my returns. 
-Often is not better. Like everyone, early on I was as impatient as one can get. Even now I’m not very patient. Regardless, I felt like I needed to have a bunch of trades working for “the probabilities” to work out. The problem I had was I was forcing entries to maintain volume even if there wasn’t a copacetic set up. I transitioned to trading where I truly identified opportunity, not by a timeframe preference. 
-Account size and style. Small accounts (I’m defining as &lt;$50K) have inherent constraints that have to be uniquely resolved or accepted. The markets don’t care. The world is not fair. It’s shitty but it’s very difficult for small accounts to maintain solid risk reward profiles and achieve decent returns. It is what it is. The cool part is once we get over that small account hurdle, the way we trade a $250K portfolio isn’t dissimilar from a $500K or $1M portfolio. The main variance becomes priorities and goals. 
-Think long term. I’ve mentioned this before because I sincerely wish I did a better job practicing how I was going to trade when I switched from growth to income focused.

I've previously been using obviously support and resistance levels to try and usually scalp about 5-10% on 0 dte's (or maybe a bit more if it's looking good).

But lately, I've been more and more interested in the self fulfilling nature of the Fib retracement, in that there is no apparently particular reason for the 38.2 and 61.8 to be so important other than the fact that everyone else is counting on it.

I've tried drawing it before and it didn't make much sense because I wasn't quite sure where to put the start and finish. As for my particular purpose, should I always pick the low of the day (or low of the previous day if it's morning) and also pick the most recent high of the day or previous day? That's the part that throws me. Exactly which low and high to pick. I drew this on yesterday's (July 27, 2022 FOMC day for those of you reading later) SPY 1 minute and it looks like it makes sense, bouncing pretty nicely off several levels, including 38.1 in after hours.  

That said, it makes it even a little more confusing to me because those lows I picked weren't actually the absolute lows of the day--the low of the day came right after the market opened, but I picked these for this purpose because it felt more right for some non specific reason.

Any tips or observations for me.?

I’ve been familiar &amp; involved with options since the start of 2022 and after a handful of mistakes, decided to step back &amp; just paper trade to vet my analysis &amp; trades and get some insight without risk, which I’ve been doing for about 3 months. I take notes, monitor my trade history &amp; try to do some analysis most nights. 

I find that where I really struggle is with finding a proper entry for my trades, particularly on daily and shorter time frames. 

An example of a (paper) trade I’ll often make would be for me to do analysis on the (sometimes) monthly, weekly, daily, 1hr and 4hr charts, identify patterns &amp; trends I see, confirm the price action respecting these in the above time frames. 

Then I’ll buy single calls/puts a few weeks out, always making entries after influential events to confirm respect for trends and patterns if applicable. My entries always suck and I’ll spend the majority of a contracts life in the red but end green. 

This obviously has led me to the desire to improve my entries to see far better returns. 

How can I do this? Analysis on 15min, 5min, 10min, 30min? Do the 1hr and 4hr have strong correlation for intraday movements? 

TLDR: my entries into positions suck. My trades spend most of their time being red but typically profit in the end. How can I analysis and chart better in short time frames to help this?

I am quite knowledgeable with my options but I might be missing something here.  I normally trade more liquid options like SPY and I am wondering if liquidity is the issue here but also noticed that even with ITM calls, the value of it will depreciate rather quickly even at the slightest retrace.  

Is RUT a combination of bad greeks and low liquidity?  Can't figure it out.

I don't get why on the same exact expiry, some strikes are at a loss or even break even though the RUT itself is up over 2% for the day? 

Also, on some that I circled, some strikes are at ""0%"" in change with a strike directly above or below with a 20% or higher change for the day.

So far, I was only able to find [this](https://www.optionvisualizer.com) website which basically has all of the filters in the picture but the ROI one. I created [this](https://www.optionvisualizer.com/option-screener?o.volume=manual|20|&amp;o.probability_of_profit=manual|1.75|&amp;o.days_before_expiration=manual|0|6&amp;o.distance_from_strike_percentage=manual|0.5|7&amp;o.implied_volatility=manual|75|&amp;o.radio_option_type=manual|false|true&amp;sort_by=s.ticker&amp;sort_order=desc&amp;group_by=default) scan with it, and replaced the missing ROI filter with the ""Probability Of Profit"" one as I think they may be the same, but I am not sure.

What I want to do is basically trying to implement the CSPs strategy discussed here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeAiH4mS3YU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeAiH4mS3YU), but I need an options scanner which enables to search by the filters explained in that video.

Any suggestion is highly welcome.

**EDIT**: Thanks to u/metalguysilver's suggestion, I was able to register a paper account with ThinkOrSwim so I can now use the very same scanner pictured in my post."|0.91|67|0|67

t3_w7to01|1658767288|options|Finding Trading Strategies from Research Papers|"This post will teach you how to find trading strategies from SSRN research papers. I wanted to figure out if there's any money to be made reading these papers, so I interviewed Professor Ing Haw Cheng, whose recent research includes volatility and commodity derivatives. Ing gives us insight into an academic's approach to research, what that means for the practical trader, and also discusses his recent paper outlining a commodity options trading strategy""

# The Research Process

*“People say ‘You have so much data, can’t you just figure everything out?’ And the answer is no actually. There’s so much noise, the random variation of what happens every day.”*

The first part of the research is all about finding and testing hypotheses rather than mining data. This usually builds off previous knowledge rather than starting from scratch. If researchers simply try to find patterns by digging through mountains of financial data, oftentimes they end up with spurious findings. For example, you could find a correlation between cumulative rainfall in Asia and the price of the S&amp;P 500. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything just because both numbers historically increased over time. 

“*I often think of my research as producing what I would call a ‘proof of concept’ trading strategy, which is an idea that other people can optimize and potentially trade”*

The second part is testing the hypothesis using data. Ing writes papers with what he calls a “proof of concept” trading strategy, where he looks for effects in the market with a reasonable amount of signal which could survive trading costs. However, the paper wouldn’t be a fully optimized step-by-step trading strategy, but rather the foundational ideas of what a signal could look like, and a description of a market phenomenon which could be implemented by traders.

According to Ing, academics tend to take a really simple or arbitrary approach in developing a trading strategy - for example, many papers seem to sort assets into quintiles or deciles; buying the best performing and selling the worst. This makes implementing a trading strategy straight from an academic paper difficult. However, this is by design; the market anomalies that researchers study should exist even with ""basic"" trading strategies to minimize the risk of overfitting (finding a pattern in noise that is unlikely to repeat itself)

With that being said, a lot of detail that matters in real life simply doesn’t make it into a paper. 

**An academic's goal is to prove the phenomenon exists; a trader's job is to figure out how best to monetize it.**

Traders have to work out what strikes work best for this trading strategy, how many days to expiration should they trade, or even what time of day is best for executing the strategy. There’s a lot of work to be put into backtesting, measuring performance, and refining the trading strategy before an academic paper can be implemented in real trading. 

# Hedging Pressure and Commodity Option Prices

In his paper, Ing writes about a trading strategy that provides liquidity to end users of options. 

Farmers don’t want to watch corn prices rapidly fall, and airlines don’t want to see oil climbing day after day. Commodity producers (and consumers) typically use futures and options in order to hedge their exposure. For every buyer, there has to be a seller (and vice versa), but being on the opposite end of these trades sucks. This is because the counterparty takes on the risk that prices move the wrong way. Not only that, holding these positions cost traders collateral, which could be put to use somewhere else. 

This leads to market inefficiency. There are a lot of commodity end users who want (or sometimes are required) to trade in the options market. These end users are price-insensitive; they don’t really care if they buy or sell an option for $1 or $1.10 - they just need to hedge. This presents an opportunity for price-sensitive traders who are willing to sell stuff people want to buy (at a premium), and buy stuff people want to sell (for a discount). 

The paper finds that when selling puts and buying calls are profitable when hedgers are hedging downside risk, and the opposite is also true. Of course, this is a high-variance trading strategy which also requires a lot of margins, which partially explains why this inefficiency still exists. 

In the paper, Ing writes that while it is a high-variance strategy, trading this way is profitable in his backtests. With futures options data and COT reports, we can backtest this strategy on our own, tweak the parameters a little, and add this strategy to our portfolio. 

# A Sneak Peek

**Ing told us about an anomaly in Vix futures he’s currently studying:**

*“Whenever there’s a major shock in the market, we know the vix goes through the roof. Vix futures are a bet on what the vix is going to be in the future, and whenever volatility goes way up, we can expect it to decline in the future. During periods like March 2020, we see the vix goes through the roof, but vix futures display a remarkable rate of mean reversion.”*

Ing mentioned how during March 2020, the VIX was somewhere in the 80 range, but Vix futures with one week to expiration were at around 50. There’s a theory that people who buy vix futures sell these futures during a volatility spike because they want to take profits - pressing the level of these futures downwards. These are people willing to sell for too little in exchange for being able to get out quickly.

With a little more time, maybe we could trade this effect when the next crash happens... 

**Conclusion**

\- Academic papers can be a good way to find trading strategies that you otherwise wouldn't know about. 

\- There are nuances between how academics approach trading and how traders do.

\- It may be profitable to provide liquidity (buy and sell to) hedgers who are forced to trade regardless of price."|0.76|22|0|22

t3_w7st6h|1658765241|options|SOFI weekly CC play|"SOFI weekly CC play

This opportunity is either do to volatility premium and risk-adjusted reward for SOFI, but the play here is the SOFI is reporting quarter 2 earnings on August 2nd, 2022 or Tuesday of next week.

Scrolling through many of the stocks in my watchlists that are reporting earnings sometime this week or on Monday next week, it can be seen that the risk/reward of earning season is being priced into many of the option chains, ESPECIALLY the slightly ITM or OTM call options expiring this week or next week.

Along with earnings season, GDP numbers are being reported on the 28th along with FOMC meeting on July 27th - 28th are major catalysts in the coming weeks.

These catalysts (earnings, GDP, FOMC) have caused option prices to be generally inflated to price in this volatility, but 

SOFI seems to be pricing in a larger than expected amount of risk for the options expiring on Friday, and so I initiated a CC position.

Here are the details:

100 shares of SOFI at price of 6.4271
1 short call July 29 2022, $6 strike for a premium of 0.48 per share

Maximum return on risk on this position is 0.89% or a 64.9% annualized return with this occurring at a price of $6 and the breakeven for this position at $5.95.

Also many of the big banks and investment banks such as JPM &amp; GS have already reported earnings along with Consumer Finance peers of SOFI such as ALLY have also reported earnings meaning that less risk should be priced into SOFI considering it is the “last of its group” to report.

The one caveat is that SOFI is itself a volatile stock which definitely explains part of the higher than expected premium, but my thesis is that it doesn’t explain it all.

The x axis is showing the average historic move for the stock on all past releases: that's the mean of the the highest / lowest variation of the stock the day after release. This is based on historic data.

The y axis is based on current options pricing. It is the implied move, ie the amount of absolute move the stock needs to have for a movement trade to be profitable. This is calculated from the closest expiration straddle pricing. By comparing both numbers, you can get an idea of what the market is expecting as move, vs what really happened in the past.

The upper part of the graph (above the y=x middle line) are stocks where the implied is higher than the past average (the further the higher), and that is what makes an overvalued: expectations are higher than what happened in the past. And vice versa for the lower part and undervalued."|0.9|67|0|67

### In the News

More than a third of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 report this week including Microsoft, Alphabet (Tuesday), Meta (Wednesday) and Apple, Amazon (Thursday). In addition, the end of the week will see potential market moving economic data with GDP on Thursday, employee cost and personal consumption (inflation data) and home prices on Friday.

Since the begining of June the SPY has traded in a range of $365 to $417. It now sits slightly above the middle of that range. Those highs and lows are roughly 6% away in either direction. One of the ramifications of the recent move higher in the market has been a drop in implied volatility. Therefore the options market isn’t pricing a 6% move until mid-September to the highs and lows of the recent range:

t3_w6swe4|1658659940|options|Anyone planning option buys with price limits based on an expected pull back?|"Anyone planning the buy / sell of an option with limit prices in advance? This might be obvious - or there might be an obvious mistake in the rational:)

E.g. 

* As an example I'm looking at VEEV Aug 19th 210/220 Bull Call Spread  
   * [VEEV Aug 19th 210/220 Bull Call Spread (optionstrat.com)](https://optionstrat.com/sX0VUNepGDeF)
* When looking at the VEEV chart below, I might not want to buy a bull call spread today as VEEV is up to 213 USD and might come down again to about 203-205 range before going back up.
* Looking at the optionstrat table - if the stock price goes to 205 in the next week, this bull call spread would go down in value +- 200 USD
* Hence instead of actively monitoring live performance of the strategy (as I don't have much time during the day) - I could just place a limit order now to buy the bull call spread at ($495-$200= $295) to maximize my chance of winning? (at least in comparison with buying the spread now as I think there's still a chance it'd go down a bit but I wouldn't expect it to go down below the 203-205 range.)

t3_w6hk4m|1658619747|options|Cheaper Tesla Options?|"So I'm not the smartest guy in the world. Maybe you saw yesterday but I didn't understand the risks of options and made a post asking where 100 people commented about how stupid I am. Fair enough, I now learned a lot more and I'm learning from youtube videos a robinhood worker gave me (i called robinhood at like 1am to ask a lot of questions, guy was also really cool). But anyways I posted this on WSB a few days ago and I think it is genius and I am now up far more than when it was posted and it has a long way to climb up in my opinion. Curious to see your guys thought because a lot of you know a lot more about options then I do apparently. Just note it's a risk I was dumb when I bought it and I am still dumb. However I do genuinely believe I am right and this is a great idea. 

Also if u want a video form of me saying this it is here 
https://youtu.be/fBF5KF-bKGc . The text below is probably better to read but if u don't want to feel free to watch.

So basically you probably knew this but the SEC allowed single stock ETFs like a week ago. TSLQ is one that's shorts Tesla and the one I am mostly interested in. I think that people drastically underrated how much this changes things. Literally everything will be different in my opinion. People were saying this is just options with extra steps and let me explain why I think its not. First of all you can buy options on these for a massive discount. Let me explain
Tesla options are very very expensive 
If we look at a date like 8/19 (the first available options for TSLQ) we can see that the calls and puts are over 50.00 dollars so over 5k to buy them. And some are even more pricey and the further out you go (date wise) the higher cost overall.
TSLQ as you would guess are way cheaper. A lot of contracts still have yet to be filled (in my experience the lowest i was able to get was 2.00 for a contrcat that plummeted already) and 2.75 for one of the 0s. 
To me this will drastically change and will climb closer to the Tesla prices because these are again just a way to buy discounted Tesla options. For example TSLQ shorts Tesla therefore I have purchased puts (my positions at bottom) so really I basically bought calls on Tesla. 
The issue is that the trading volume is low which is because it's new in my opinion. Once people start realizing that you can do this and it is accessible in Robinhood I think the will go up to easily a 1:5 TSLQ to Tesla ratio. 
That's just my theory though and I put a lot of money into trusting it (a lot for me cause im broke, not alot to a lot of you). 

TLDR:
So basically going back to my play I am not betting necessarily that TSLQ will get to whatever I buy my call/put at I am betting that before it expires people will realize the potential and upside to these insanely undervalue things. 

My positions 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Fi7Vkn3Uh7P37Ljdfqkx0pu_QrL4BcP/view?usp=drivesdk 

Wish I had more money I can take this risk with but I hope you all could capitalize on it. (Which also makes me money, obviously)
And again I am confident and am fine with taking L if I'm wrong but on the one that I'm down like -190 or whatever that is like 95% of what I put it. Not worried though

However, sometimes when the forward price is far from the present price, it should not be reasonable to assume that a price change adequate to the difference between the forward and damage is the presumably market outcome. Frequently, there is also good reason to assume that some price between the forward and price is more likely than the forward price.

# When I posted this DD, these $170/$155 put spreads were OTM. Now they're more than 50% ITM. The combined profit from these $170/$155 spreads and the $145/$137 spreads are now above +50% — if you're in with me, it's time to take some profit, roll down with house money, and play for free.

**If you have both, you can do that by \*only\* selling the more expensive $170/$155's, which I managed to offload for $8.60 today, and keeping the $145/$137 put spread which still has upside potential of 5X. If you have JUST the $170/$155's, you can do this by rolling down to the $150/$140 put spreads, which I managed to get today for just $2.05.**

**Whichever you choose, it's highly** **important from a risk-management perspective to act on this third day of big red candles. We're deep into profit now. This isn't WSB — real option traders who trade for a living (me) take profit when it's given, and you can use option roll-downs to do that while still maintaining exposure to this trade. There's n\*\*\*\*o need to hold any extra risk through $GOOGL's print — Alphabet may perform well, and as I said in the analysis below, that would not bode well for these spreads. You want to be playing for free or as close to it before 4PM EST market close.**

**The FOMC kicks off the following Wednesday and any mention of inflation abating or ""we don't see a recession in the cards"" will send these oversold stocks into overdrive. It isn't worth the risk. You can even take full profit if you're comfortable exiting the trade before the four major risk events that will take place over the next three days (GOOG, FOMC, GDP, Meta's ER release).**

# Tl;dr: Remember, no one ever went broke taking profit. This is your opportunity to either collect &gt;50% profit on the whole of both positions, OR to roll down, remove your entire cost basis AND some profit, while SIMULTANEOUSLY playing for free. If you are holding any of these positions, do NOT miss this opportunity to manage risk.

**Brief Bear Case for $META (tl;dr)**:

After ER misses from $SNAP &amp; $TWTR, falling FB &amp; IG App Store metrics, and continued dominance from TikTok, $META puts into earnings look like a reasonable trade. However, with an IV rank of 94% (IV has only been higher 6% of the time in recent history), navigating this trade is going to take some nuance. If you don’t have time to read, that means I’m arming myself with bearish put debit spreads expiring July 29th ahead of $META’s earnings.

**First, some facts:**

* $META carries an average single-day earnings move of 10.5% over the last 5 quarters.
* February 2nd saw a particularly brutal outcome of -26.39% — the [largest single day loss of market cap in market history](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-platforms-stock-facebook-market-capitalization-51643908656), -$232.02B.
* $META shares recently reached a fresh &gt;2-year low of $154.25 during the week beginning 6/21/22.
* Prior to that, $META reached a brief pandemic low of $137.10 during the week beginning 3/16/20. 
   * How brief? The week prior (beginning 3/09/20), $META closed at $154.34 — $0.09 above its most recent June low. 
   * The week following (beginning 3/23/20) $META closed at $156.79 — $2.54 above its most recent low.
   * Outside of the week beginning 3/16/20, $META has respected the $154 level since early 2019.
* Since reporting earnings in February of 2022, shares of $META have remained in a technical downtrend, with a linear regression rate of roughly 0.758. 
* Despite reporting upbeat earnings and guidance in April of 2022, the stock was unable to escape the downtrend.
* The bottom of this bearish channel coincides perfectly with $META’s pandemic low of $137.10.
* TikTok continues to dominate Facebook, Instagram and Messenger from a growth and revenue perspective.
   * On a list of the top grossing apps in the US, Tiktok places 3rd, Facebook places 84th. Instagram and Messenger are too low to feature.
* Lastly, Zuckerberg himself has been blunt about the current state of Meta. 
   * [Meta slashes hiring plans.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-meta-girds-fierce-headwinds-slower-growth-second-half-memo-2022-06-30/)
      * CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees to brace for a deep economic downturn.

&gt;""If I had to bet, I'd say that this might be one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history,"" Zuckerberg told workers in a weekly employee Q&amp;A session, audio of which was heard by Reuters.

**Conclusion**: Bearish

In the wake of $SNAP and $TWTR missing earnings on the top and bottom line, Tiktok’s continued growth, a firm technical downtrend in $META shares, and a strong propensity for outsized earnings moves, there are plenty of reasons to get bearish ahead of $META’s earnings this Thursday. However, with a 94% IV rank, strong support at $154, a 10.5% average earnings move, and IV crush to contend with, it’s critical from a vega and theta perspective to utilize a put debit spread here.

**The Trade Structure**: Put Debit Spreads

**Safe**: Targeting the $155 support level. 

**Lotto**: Target the $137 support level if $META breaks below $155 and falls to the bottom of it’s downtrend, the pandemic low of $137.10.

For July 29th, **long $170 puts, short $155 puts** — Risking $5.00 for a profit of $10.00, breakeven of $165 and maximum value of $15.00 if $META satisfies its 10.5% expected move. 

**OR**

For July 29th, **long $145 puts, short $137 puts** — Risking $1.00 for a profit of $7.00, breakeven of $144 and maximum value of $8.00 if $META has another outsized earnings move like it did in February, targeted at the next area of support.

**Alternatively**, you can combine these two trades by running long $170 puts, short $137 puts — Risking $9.00 for a profit of $24.00, breakeven of $161 and maximum value of $33.00 if $META falls to it’s pandemic low. 

No matter which trade you pick, it’s important to collect at least *some* premium on this. Holding through earnings is risky business, IV crush and theta are going to be very much in play here with these short term, OTM options, which is why we want to target the ATM $170 strike for our long position. 

**Trade Headwinds**: 

* $META’s earnings report falls on July 27th, after market close — directly in between the FOMC’s next rate hike meeting (July 26th) and directly before we get QoQ GDP data (July 28th, 8:30 AM EST). That means that the market will be simultaneously reacting to both $META earnings and GDP data. If the GDP reaction is bad, that’s a big tailwind. If the GDP reaction is good, we could see extra noise on this trade which we can’t afford from a time basis.
* Alphabet ($GOOGL) and Microsoft ($MSFT) earnings reports are due on July 26th — right before $META. A positive report from either company could prove to be a macro headwind for this bearish trade.

Despite these headwinds, there are plenty of big reasons to make a bearish trade on $META ahead of earnings. 

**The Wrap Up**

Use $170/$155 put debit spreads ahead of $META’s earnings to target the current &gt;2 year low and an average move of 10.5% — OR — Target the $137 pandemic low if you’re looking for a larger than average earnings move (and are comfortable with more risk).

however, one thing i'm a bit confused about is: when it's near expiration and it's time to sell (to profit, obviously) the calls, what would happen if there's absolutely no one to buy them off of you? i am aware this is probably *extremely* rare, but i'm just thinking hypothetically.   


with LEAPs being *so* far ITM, i imagine the open interest and volume would be very sparse, if any, and the only option (pun not intended) would be to exercise the calls.   


but what if i don't have the cash to secure the exercise? will my broker give me leeway if i sell immediately after exercising the LEAPs? or will there be a margin call if i *technically* don't have cash in the account at the time of exercise?   


i would highly prefer using all of my capital for the LEAPs themselves, as the leverage is the only reason i would want to purchase them anyways. having to have the capital to be able to afford the shares in case i have to exercise is a bit counter-intuitive to me, but is that just an inevitable risk with LEAPs?

t3_w4xcca|1658452326|options|"Attention ""Wheel"" traders: You're probably doing it wrong"|"TLDR - If you ""wheel"" and your cash sits in your account doing nothing while you have a cash secured put, you will be more profitable by doing a covered call instead due to the effect of ""Rho"".

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't know already the ""Wheel"" strategy involves selling cash secured puts, then if you get assigned and buy the shares you sell covered calls until you get assigned and sell the shares, then rinse/repeat. **But if your cash is just sitting there while you have a cash secured put then you are leaving money on the table**. Let me explain

The ""risk free rate"" is one of the variables in the black &amp; scholes options pricing model represented by the greek ""Rho"". As interest rates go up, calls go up in value and puts go down in value. Longer term options are more affected by Rho than shorter term options.

Here is one example for why this happens.

https://preview.redd.it/fot2ke8fv0d91.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e63b3e23ecfeebf33164b0af0b162ebb8bf7a08c

Let's assume you're thinking about buying 100 shares of NTES, a $100 stock, for 10k total. But instead of this you decide to buy a deep ITM $50 strike call for $50.20. You have the same upside potential as someone who owns the shares(minus the 20 cents of time value) but you spent 5k less cash. The black &amp; scholes model assumes you are earning the ""risk free rate"" on that 5k extra cash for the duration of the option which means the call has to be priced higher to account for that so that there is no ""free lunch"".

**A cash secured put and a covered call have literally the same profit/loss profile.** There is no difference to the trades except for the amount of cash being spent/received, and the difference in time value received due to that difference in cash + the effect of Rho.

With a cash secured put you are not spending any cash. The cash being secured can theoretically be invested and the black &amp; scholes model assumes it is invested at the risk free rate for the duration of the option. This is why the put premium is adjusted down when interest rates are higher so that again there is no ""free lunch"".

Take a look at these screenshots for another example. 

https://preview.redd.it/1wkqsoe6w0d91.png?width=529&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab570f8bd831af98c108369917bd8c040d165c89

https://preview.redd.it/7bo1ipe6w0d91.png?width=538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c17aec4a4daae2f504c390234efa3b8f4943f6ab

NTES at the money call for Jan 2024 is 21.00 bid, 23.50 mid, 26.00 ask. At the money put is 18.00 bid, 20.50 mid, 23.00 ask. A very clear difference which can be explained by Rho. Interest rates are higher now so this is becoming more relevant. It's not as noticeable on shorter duration options but the difference is still definitely there and can add up if you do a lot of them.

**So if you are doing cash secured puts and your cash is just sitting there the whole time earning basically no interest, then I would argue the better alternative is to just skip the cash secured put and go straight to a covered call.** Buy the shares and sell a call for the same strike you were going to sell the put at. Again there is no difference in the profit/loss profiles but you would be getting more time value on the covered call due to the effect of Rho.

But if you insist on doing cash secured puts for some reason at least try to invest your money in some kind of ""cash equivalent"" like a short duration US treasury bill. They usually have very low margin requirements and some brokers allow you to secure puts with them.

Side note: If the stock has an ex-dividend date then the stock will drop by the dividend amount on that date. The options take this into consideration. Therefore puts expiring on/after that ex-date will go up in value and calls will go down in value. This may make it seem like a cash secured put is a better deal versus a covered call than it actually is but it's not because with a cash secured put you don't get the dividend. With a covered call you do.

Side note 2: There are rare instances where puts are more expensive than the calls such as on DWAC right now. This means the optimal ""wheel"" strategy would be to start with a cash secured put, then if assigned, sell the shares and sell another put at the same strike you would have sold the covered call at. If possible invest the cash that is securing the put into some kind of ""cash equivalent"" so you can earn close to the risk free rate"|0.82|68|0|68

France announced back when the stock was trading at 8€ that they would purchase the remaining of the stock they didn’t own yet (the state owned around 90%, and they want to have 100%) at for 12€/share, a 4€ premium per share. 

It’s clear what will happen for investors who own shares: on the right date (to be specified) their shares will be called away and receive 12€ per share. This is great news for the short term holders, as the stock has been trading below 10€ for quite a long time, but bad news for the long term holders, as the stock hasn’t really recovered to the levels it had initially. 

But… What happens to option holders? With US options, the buyer can exercise the contract at *or earlier* than expiration date, but with European options (if I’m not mistaken), the buyer can exercise the contract *only* at expiration date. So I’m wondering what will happen for a buyer of (call) options of EDF if their strike date is after the nationalization date. What my short knowledge tells me is that those people will end up with a useless contract, as by the time they will be allowed to exercise the contract the shares will no longer be available. However, this also seems a bit wrong, so I guess there’s some mechanism in place to protect the buyer in this case.

t3_w3u1g2|1658342593|options|Trade Halliburton Earning with Iron Butterfly|"**Halliburton (ticker:HAL)** reported its earnings for Q2/2022 on 07/19 before market open. The analysts estimated revenue was **$4.71B** and the EPS was **$0.45**. The reported revenue and EPS were **$5.07B** and **$0.49**, both exceeded estimates. The reported revenue was up **18.5%** and the EPS was up **40%** from from last quarter.

**What I traded**

On 7/18 before market closed, I opened an Iron Butterfly position.  The 4 contracts that constituted this trade were: long 26put, short 29put, short 29 call, and long 32 call (exp. 07/22).  This is a direction neutral strategy, so I'd be profitable if stock price landed between breakeven points, which are $27.3-$30.7.

[Iron Butterfly Payoff](https://preview.redd.it/ydmazlt9irc91.png?width=433&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e6113cde7187cb1d5264891b5639443e81bb563)

**How I came up with this trade**

Halliburton stock hovered around $29 before market close on 7/18. The ATM straddle expired on **7/22** was priced at $1.9, which indicates that the expected post-earning price move was between **$29± $1.9**. This is known as the **implied move**.

[Straddle price as proxy of implied move](https://preview.redd.it/umdq2touirc91.png?width=448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15a5c4b9fa534110db8431b616cd0d406dfe4b6a)

The post-earning stock prices for Halliburton have been consistently landing within the anticipated move. This indicates that for this stock, the market tends to overestimate the actual move.

[Implied vs Actual Move](https://preview.redd.it/objd0t5kjrc91.png?width=1127&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58b4fc6e9d21bd71f0baa6ae6c0685ad85cb5310)

Going into the earnings, the oil stocks have been trending down amid the lower gas price. IV percentile of Halliburton reached 84.13% right before earnings announcement, which signaled a short volatility opportunity.

[Price and IV trends](https://preview.redd.it/cj42f14ojrc91.png?width=937&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc719f66e79ab3cce8fd8e7adaf20e14fda8735a)

**Trade Management**

On 7/18 3:57pm, I submitted a limit order which was executed with $1.64 credits.

[Open Position](https://preview.redd.it/dg9bkssqkrc91.png?width=523&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48ab53afb0b899e8762cd9d79cfae80f68d3b808)

After the stronger than expected earning results, Halliburton stock opened higher on 7/18.  (I missed the opportunity to close the put side when it hit $30)

[7.18 Price Action](https://preview.redd.it/gzo1mg5qlrc91.png?width=1217&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f06d0fe472632c5b59bf9f65c2c940ff4a609b19)

During the day the stock moved back around $29, which was the middle strike price of my butterfly.  Since there are still a few days left for expiration, extrinsic value for both the ATM put and call were still high, therefore the unrealized profit was very limited.

Before market close on 7/19, the stock was lingering around $29.4, so my short put became out-the-money and short call was in-the-money. I decided to leave the call spread and close the put side with $46 debit.  The realized return given the initial credit I collected from the put side was  roughly 50%.

[Buy to close put spread](https://preview.redd.it/2gfwtmg7mrc91.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22380d81caf33fda7f5fb09cf2e204d46d911ee4)

On 7/19, HAL price was volatile during the morning session, yet I got distracted again and missed the opportunity to close the call side when the price was trending down.

[7.19 Price Action](https://preview.redd.it/d1tgiudtmrc91.png?width=1778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4651a1df3b3c35583ddf2ad1d81fff6b2bb9c361)

I eventually closed the call side earlier  in the afternoon when the stock was around $29.  The total debit I paid was $53, which was lower than 7/18 when the stock was at $29 thanks to time decay. The realized return from the call side was  roughly 30%.

[Buy to close call spread](https://preview.redd.it/qc7hve22nrc91.png?width=523&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5c68111942b8a36da934a5dda1e52ff47b0662b)

**Conclusion**

My overall return on risk is 49%.  If the earnings had come later during the week, the IV crush for the 7/22 expiration would have been dramatic and I may have taken profit sooner.  On the flip side, the early-in-the-week announcement gives me more days to 'be right', so I could manage this trade the way I did by closing the put spread and call spread separately.

t3_w3b12y|1658285111|options|Trading Options EARLY On|"I saw a few comments on a post asserting that options aren’t good for new traders. While I understand their overall message, I still disagree. If I were to start all over again, I would’ve began with options vice just equities. 

Options are complex and can pose tremendous risk, particularly when we’re new and don’t even see the risk.

To clarify, if I were to start again, it would be on one strategy (and it’s individual legs), the covered strangle in an index etf like SPY or IWM (my go to personally). This is an entirely viable approach for new traders, particularly looking to learn while deploying a general buy and hold approach. 

-Start with long shares or sell a put until assigned
-Either add long shares, sell another put, sell a covered call, or do a combination (I prefer to create a ratio of long to short deltas to uncap upside) 
-We can apply extremely basic analysis if we want, like no entry or flatten when S &lt; 50d MA. Or we can simply deploy regardless of price as part of a long-term buy and hold position. 

The issue is when people want to try day trading options, or are slinging $1 wide verticals in 20 different equities because TT said they should. 

However, options can be a great place to start trading. We can do it conservatively before we even fully understand the nuances of the products."|0.5|0|0|0

1. Choose strong stock you believe in long term 
2. Make sure you are SELLING a call
(Some brokers default your order to buy)
3. Sell covered calls on green days, strike price should be above price per share
4. Make strike price high enough to be unlikely to be hit
5. Use stock you won’t be salty about losing
 (edit: change 4 and 5 to something like “make strike enough to make decent profit but not unrealistically high, expect some strikes to hit and be happy with the profit”)
6. Use a stock on stagnant or positive uptrend
7. Shorter expirations can allow for collection of more premiums vs longer expirations (under 30 days)
8. General baseline delta of .3 or lower for learning (buyer has a 30% of that option going into the money)
9. Don’t trade all of position (ex: 1 contract with 300 shares) (edit: don’t worry about this one)
10. Be mindful of ex dividend dates/other dates
11. Buy to close at 75% of premium
 (edit; adjust to 30-50%, it’s worth to close sooner rather than wait and hope for higher percentage)

t3_w24umx|1658164814|options|Monthly series of 'real' trades, using indicators from unusual options activity (FCX today)|"Hey guys! Haven't posted in a while and decided to mirror some of my trades here.

&amp;#x200B;

As an options trader of roughly 8 years now, one thing that I really like to do is look at trades that other people do (especially with unusual options activity) and try my best to understand which side of the trade they are on. Why unusual options activity? Well, wallstreet is a close network, and some of these trades point straight towards, well, people knowing something or having a STRONG opinion about the direction of the stock in the coming days/months.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, given that all options trading data is public, screeners (such as Barchart) give us good insights into what is happening on wallstreet - at least when it comes down to one thing: Options trading.

&amp;#x200B;

The exercise is quite simple. You look at a trade and try to understand which side they are on. Did they 'Sell' the options, just wanting to collect the premium? Or did they take a position and use options as an instrument to strongly leverage their returns.

&amp;#x200B;

This of course can be quite hard. You will need to do some research into the company. Look at charts/TA, see if earnings is happening within the duration of their trade etc.

Some from today.

https://preview.redd.it/whs6z52rucc91.png?width=2346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7e982212b364e213a53e9f38c8f05ed120b7266

Given that I don't touch WISH and LCID with a 10 foot pole, TTWO and FCX stuck out. Having a close look at both, I saw that FCX had even more unusual options activity trades a bit further down, and decided to go with that one:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/skvvl2kzvcc91.png?width=2284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbcb2c0587f20988d63e9fb487064183040b1342

40 Call, 10/21/22 (95 days out), price 0.40$, volume: 12,630. Up from 1,347. So sometime in the last 24 hours, roughly 11,000 calls were traded.

  
**Closer look at FCX chart.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wotek7iivcc91.png?width=2602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e4e66b076b965aaa0f0b763c94c1f3bb7fcaa5b

Copper? Materials? Yikes. Now to be frank, I have never heard of this company before, I don't trade minerals, or cooper at all. So let's get a bit more esoteric and feel into this traders trade.

  
**Case 1**

The trader believes FCX bottomed out, and given that earnings are this Thursday, perhaps there is a reversal with FCX trading higher in the next 60-90 days. Any significant movement towards 35 or 40$ would push those Far OTM Calls massively. 11.000 Calls purchased for roughly $500k would be up 500% at the end of September. 2-4 Million return in 2 months? Definitely enticing.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/siv08kvuxcc91.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4a6fcb5b1480dd8cc0fa3e61f3f89af675fa790

**Case 2**

The trader knows the FCX earnings will not be great, further pushing the stock to trade between 20 and 30, never truly reaching anywhere close to the 40$ mark in the next month. 500k in premiums for a single trade? Sounds great too!

  
**Now what do I think?** 

I believe that the trader was entering a long position. The stock price reversing and trending towards 35 and 40 is probable after earnings is probable. TA wise FCX looks like it definitely got beaten down hard in the last months. But what actually made me emulate the trade on the Long side is that I rarely see traders selling a massive call position OTM but still in exactly that 60-90 day timeframe, right when the stock is trending up and earnings are a few days out. It could of course still be a hedge or part of a larger position, but traders selling 11k naked calls seems a tad too risky to me. 

Then lastly, the current daily gain of nearly 8% is intriguing for sure, but this could also be chalked off to market makers adjusting their exposure after someone purchased 11.000 calls....

  
**What did I do?** 

I entered a Bull Call Spread (35/40), same date of course, for a price of 0.57$. This lowers my risk and caps my profit. BUT I can get a bit more bang for my buck. 11 spreads. Let's see how the next 60 days play out. 

  
Now, perhaps anyone here knows a bit more about FCX or unusual options activity and wants to take a stab at it, sharing their thoughts?"|0.8|9|0|9

t3_w1ryq7|1658124219|options|One of my toughest struggles trading options|"One of my largest hurdles trading options was establishing a healthy understanding and relationship with trading options. 

We MUST take (ideally “good”) risk in order to make money. The paradox: we must also tightly control risk to ensure we can withstand turbulent (subjective to the style of trading) markets. There are two main risk approaches for traders- the cavalier who are risk takers; and the conservatives who seek to avoid risk. As with much of life, striking balance is the goal. We need to take risk, but not too much. 

I had an extremely hard time with this early. I started trading early, in high school, where I worked extremely hard in low income side hustle jobs. I did not want to lose what I had been working so hard for. Interestingly, this mindset initially led to death by 1000 papercuts. 

It went like this:
-Very conservative early on, trading mostly verticals. Cutting winners too quick. Negatively expectant. 
-Few years in, gained confidence, grew size. Took the largest loss (as a % of my portfolio) to date. Negatively expectant. 
-This is the real bitch, I reeled all the way back and grew to be extremely conservative again. I was positively expectant, but because of the previous issue, I was reluctant to size in. This was a HUGE hindrance and if I wasn’t able to overcome it, I would’ve been better off in a buy and hold portfolio (nothing wrong with that, just the reality of things). 

To finally get past this, I deployed a crawl, walk, run approach (we use this in the military when planning training). I essentially set different goals and carefully tracked my performance, reviewing monthly. As I hit those goals, I would size in a prescribed amount and repeat. This created a more smooth scaling in process. I honed my trading plan, risk management approach. I got to the point where I was comfortably leveraging the portfolio while in the aggressive growth phase. It came down to creating a plan, testing the controls to validate and optimize, thus increasing confidence and being able to deploy the portfolio successfully despite my general risk averse nature pertaining to the trading capital.  

Note to my younger self, we can’t make meaningful progress being too conservative and being afraid of risk. We cannot be reckless either. Create a plan, test, refine, and scale in while monitoring progress. Never allow a trade to severely damage the portfolio, but do not be afraid to size into opportunity. Balance."|0.54|3|0|3

**Last Week –** Following a late week reversal higher, SPY finished the week lower by about 1%, inside the 2% move options were pricing. That’s 3 straight weeks of moves less or inline with option pricing following 3-4 weeks of moves that far outpaced option pricing.

**This Week –** SPY options are again pricing a 2% move for the upcoming week.

**Implied Volatility / VIX –** The VIX closed the week near 24. The VIX futures curve remains upward sloping to the end of the year with Oct, Nov and Dec futures all above 28.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **2%** (+/- $8)
* QQQ **2.5%** (+/- $8)
* IWM **2.4%** (+/- $4.50)
* DIA **1.6%** (+/- $5.50)

### In the News

Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) completes a 20 for 1 split as of Monday morning. GOOGL was roughly $2240 on Friday which is $112 post-split. The stock has been in a range over the past 2 months of about 2120 and 2380. That is a range of $106 to $119 post-split. The company will report earnings the last week of July and the options market is pricing a move roughly in line with that range, just about 7% in either direction, corresponding to about $120 as a bullish consensus and $104 as bearish. Here’s the pre-split expected move for July 29th, the week of Alphabet earnings:

1. Predicting the future is impossible. People on a hot streak think they are predicting in the future when instead they are just running hot. I always say out of the 10,000 mega investment managers, there will be one that runs the hottest out of the 10,000 simply due to the nature of probability. That 1 is Warren Buffet. He isn't the smartest, that is for sure. There are thousands of smarter money managers that underperformed the S&amp;P simply due to running cold.
2. Everything is priced in to the current price. I see people saying they are positive GME or whatever will go down, yet ignore that the implied volatility on the options is 125%. They simply don't understand that. You will not beat any liquid options market, and in illiquid markets you will only beat it if you are lucky enough to get filled below theoretical value.

I am invested in Physical at a cost of $1780, borrowed some cash against it at 4% when it was around $1950, with 60% LTV. When the price of gold hits around $1400 or below I will need some margin to put off any liquidation of the Asset.

I may simply buy more Gold when that level hits and include it as further collateral to the loan and see my self as simply DCA into Gold, which I am happy to do.

Alternatively, I would like to use Options trading over the period from anytime GOld drops below $1680 to ensure that when/if it hits $1400, I have the Delta covered and can use the profit to offset further margin requirement. So giving myself some leaway I estimate needing to  cover off about $5K from a $250 downward movement in the price of Gold.

With SPX, since it's cash settled, I won't be assigned any shares.  I'm thinking I can, say, sell 1 weekly contract of SPX put and if it drops below my strike by expiration, I can buy a DITM LEAPS call at the same time I close out my put.

I then sell weekly CC against that LEAPS call.  I'll close out both positions if my CC goes above my strike at expiration.

""The call spread and put spread have similar characteristics, but they differ in terms of cash flow. The call spread is done for a debit, while the put spread is done for a credit. Since the spread has a maximum value of 5.00, in the absence
of interest considerations, the value of the two spreads at expiration must add up to 5.00. If the call spread is trading for 3.00, the put spread must be trading for 2.00. If interest rates are nonzero, and the options are subject to stock-type
settlement, their values today must add up to the present value of 5.00.""

""At expiration the value of a butterfly and an iron butterfly must add up to the amount between exercise prices""

I understand that both bull call and put spreads have the same P/L graph and how both spreads have the same max loss and gain but I am struggling to wrap my head around why the value of the spreads must sum to the maximum value of 5.00. Same goes for the sum of the value of a long butterfly and short iron butterfly.

&amp;#x200B;

dumb question... but here it goes. 

&amp;#x200B;

if you were to sell cash secured puts, does it ever make sense to short the underlying if it hits the strike on a down trend, in essence making the cash secured put a covered put? 

&amp;#x200B;

obviously the point of selling premium on the put is because 1) you are bullish on the stock and hope that it goes up and the put expires worthless or 2) you are okay owning the underlying at the strike less premium price. But just curious if it ever makes sense to short the underlying, say on morning of expiry day if you are near or at strike? or would it make better sense to just roll the put to the next week or take the shares and sell covered calls?

[Iron Butterfly Position](https://preview.redd.it/qcc6l5rnrjb91.png?width=370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46d093073e292d2de78a1bd082a933662f425074)

This is a direction neutral strategy, so I'd be profitable if stock price moves between breakeven points, which are $72-$78.

**How I came up with this trade**

MS stock hovered around $75 before market close on 7/13.  The ATM straddle expired on **7/15** was priced at $3.50.  So the MS expected post-earning price move was between **$75± $3.5**. This is known as the **implied move (market expected move, anticipated move, etc.)**.

[ATM Straddle](https://preview.redd.it/yyq913oktjb91.png?width=370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff545e52c7d83dbc96a06f3b64a79477013cc6c6)

During the last 4 earnings events, MS post-earning stock price all landed square within the anticipated move.  This indicates that for Morgan Stanley, the market tends to overestimate the actual move.

[Implied vs Actual Move](https://preview.redd.it/mjpzhyk6vjb91.png?width=687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c416ad1648612920e2ee3d0f1c545ce78f1b965b)

Going into the earnings, the sentiment for the bank sector has been very negative.  MS stock price has been plunging over the last three months, while the IV has been ramping up.

[Price and IV](https://preview.redd.it/ciar7dzcwjb91.png?width=703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c4f2269d0553af04663f71519af1e7c1770df15)

With the historical moves, price action and the IV trend, I perceived these as signals to short both vega and gamma (expect IV to crush but stock price barely moves after earnings announcement).

**What the result looks like**

On 7/13 3:55pm, I submitted a limit order which was executed with $2.75 credits.

[Open Order](https://preview.redd.it/hfgfjb0nxjb91.png?width=445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a4982cf875f2fec5da3e11b16851fa07afa425a)

&amp;#x200B;

MS stock dipped after market open amid its worse than expected earning results.

&amp;#x200B;

On its way down I decided to close my call side with $0.28 debit.  Given the initial  $1.31 credit collected from the call side, I realized $1.03 profit.

[Call Spread Close Order](https://preview.redd.it/3wvs5itpyjb91.png?width=448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3110e540f40a4b500b35bc14f665953a8562056a)

&amp;#x200B;

The lowest point the stock price hit was $72, close to the lower end of the anticipated move. Then around 9:45 the stock started rallying back up.  I decided to close my put side when the stock price hit $74.  The total debit I paid was $1.4, which is roughly the same amount of credit I collected initially. So I'm breakeven on the put side.

[Put Spread Close Order](https://preview.redd.it/qfcjo8j20kb91.png?width=450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a67388e3cc05c9c5d786576e435791eb018af6d)

In conclusion I risked roughly $220 to get $100 profit. Although the calculated chance of profit is only 50%, with the historical data I have higher conviction with this trade. As of noon 7/14, the stock has rally to $74.50, leading to a non-mover situation.  This behavior aligns well with how historically it performed after earnings announcement.  So I'm very likely to place the same trade in the next MS earning.

If the stop loss triggers for the short leg, is it better to instantly close the long leg or hold it until end of day?

If the long leg is held to the end of the day, does it expire worthless and you realize max loss for that leg?

It has had the spectre of delisting over its head since that time, as the NYSE made that announcement once REV filed. Looking at this week's put option chain, I'm seeing something I've not seen before &amp; am wondering how to interpret it. Delta is actually *decreasing* the more in the money the strikes go. My guess is that it's due to the risk of delisting, thus there being actual time value in the DITM strikes, but would appreciate input from more seasoned option players than me.

REV closed at $5.40 today. And 97 of the 337 $19 strikes were sold in one fell swoop at 3:05 PM EDT for an avg price of $14.01 while the stock was at 5.31, representing .30 in time value with 3 DTE. Here is what I see in TOS (delta is the column outlined in green).

t3_vxkc7r|1657656539|options|Calendar Spread for CPI Release|"June 2022 CPI data are scheduled to be released on July 13, 2022, at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time.

Many expect the number to go off the chart therefore consider longing a straddle to capitalize on the move.  Earlier today I noticed from SPY option chain that IV from the 7/13 expiration cycle is substantially higher than those from later cycles.

[SPY Option Chain](https://preview.redd.it/4qa7rmy6w6b91.png?width=946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e38ab08513cae5140a2bf731be333344ec48cf1e)

It is also very clear from the volatility smile that the out-of-money options for 7/13 has a much higher IV than the rest.  I believe the CPI release drives the 7/13 IV to ramp up.  Going into this event, traders are piling up puts or straddles expired on this day to bet on the directional move after the CPI release.  This create opportunities for the options seller to capitalize on the potential vol crush for the front week options post-release.

[Volatility Smile for the Next 4 Expiration Dates](https://preview.redd.it/e6grjt8nx6b91.png?width=1213&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78caadd0ded1bd526f9e51007bdbf0d5fbf14206)

I decided to trade a calendar spread (sell 7/13 put and buy 7/18 put) earlier today when SPY was at $384. I chose 7/18 put over the 7/15 put because the 7/18 volatility is lower, thus will suffer less impact from the IV crush after CPI release.  This trade incurred a total debit of $164.

[Calendar Spread](https://preview.redd.it/uslwq3tjw6b91.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f50ed628f091999c3a6944c35bbee290971713f6)

This is a direction-neutral strategy so I didn't have to guess the which way the stock goes. Breakeven points for this trade by the end of the first expiration cycle (4pm@7/13, remember there are two expiration dates) are $378 and $390.  The max profit is \~$250 and max loss is $164, which is the total debit I paid.  This is a high probability play with a 70% chance of profit.

[Payoff](https://preview.redd.it/bahrf4gyz6b91.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c85c4add49426f353bd46d2daf32eb38251893ae)

As of 4pm on 7/12 I'm basically breakeven ($10 profit actually but that's nothing) despite the last hour sell-off and recovery.  Since the CPI will be released on 8:30am ET, I may close the position right after market open if it generates 50% profit ($120).  This is a very small size bet so my downside risk is limited.

Update 7/13/2022 4:30pm:

At 8:30am, BLS released a shocking 9.1% CPI increase YOY.  SPY plunged 2.3% during pre-market session.  However, stocks climbed from the opening $375 all the way up to the closing $378.8, indicating only a -0.5% drop from the previous close. 

My trade was down \~25% after market open, but quickly recovered as the stock rallied.  Throughout the day my max profit reached 65% (debit paid) multiple times (in blue arrows).  

[Daily Move](https://preview.redd.it/6gs0lhhu6eb91.png?width=1252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=119c8cd28df96932067591f135ba805eac7a2f79)

I exited 4min before market closed when the price retrieved to **$379.28 (green arrow)**.  I spent $4.32 buying back the short put which was sold for $3.03  (-$1.29), and collected $6.42 from selling the long put which I bought for 4.67 (+$1.75).  My total return is around +25%.

[Closed Position](https://preview.redd.it/wr7vhaha7eb91.png?width=978&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94e9c0f2077a3ee480dbea9c78c022d9f6629e91)

TL;DR

I opened the position when SPY was traded at $384.  Because both puts were ATM, the value for each contract were purely extrinsic.  And since the long put has more time to expire, its extrinsic value is higher than the short put.

Then the stock dipped and both puts became ITM and had intrinsic value. Since they have the same strike price, the intrinsic value for both contracts increased simultaneously with equal amount and therefore offset each other.  

The factors that really mattered then is the extrinsic value.

The extrinsic value of the **short put** turned from $3.03 to 0. The $4.32 you see is pure intrinsic value (strike $384 - spot **$379.28**).

The extrinsic value of the **long put** also reduced but at a smaller scale. The contract value $6.42 includes $4.32 intrinsic value (same as the short put), and $2.10 of extrinsic value.  Remember that the entry price of the long put was $4.67, which is 100% extrinsic.  So the extrinsic value of the long put reduced by **$2.57** ($4.67-$2.10), which is less than **$3.03** (loss of extrinsic value by the short put)**.**  The difference is essentially the source of my profit.

Lesson learned:

1. Take profit at 50% is not a bad idea for calendar spread.
2. I opened the position around the noon, which was too early.  I would have been able to take profit earlier if I submitted the trade before market close instead.

Hope this helps

The unfortunate part is trading can be a significant wealth development tool and finding a successful approach truly isn’t that complex - not to be confused with easy. The most common reason for failure was lack of planning. I started this way too. I kinda wung things, thinking I’d somehow be successful. I was delusional. The saving grace for me was getting smacked in the face with a large loss that made me completely re-evaluate what I was doing. 

Here are 3 things I struggled with early on that I firmly believe can help any trader achieve better results. 

1. Plan it out. This doesn’t need to be crazy to start, but will increase in complexity as approach is refined. Beginning with a trade checklist, trading plan, and trade log will greatly benefit any trader. It took me 2-3 years to get serious about creating these tools and that was a mistake.  For each trade, I’d define what made me enter, what I expected it’ll do, when will I manage risk, when will I manage profit. Every. Trade. 
2. Discipline. Most of us tend to over-evaluate ourselves, in part to protect our fragile egos. I was in college ROTC training for the Marine Corps, waking up at 5am without a problem. I didn’t bother having controls because I thought I could trust myself, I was disciplined - right? Wrong. I took my largest % of portfolio loss during this timeframe. I sold a wide far OTM iron condor in RUT that I thought was “safe”. When one side fell ITM, I didn’t do anything because the probabilities “were in my favor”. The loss grew and I didn’t want to realize the loss because it was large. Then it got larger. And then larger. Before I finally intervened exited as a significant loss. The trade would’ve ended up at a max profit btw. 
3. Focus. There are a ton of strategies and variants. It can be alluring to try all of them, which there’s nothing wrong with. But don’t try all of them and rush your exploration to try others. Select 3-5 strategies and truly study them. Once you feel like you gave them a fair shake, move on. I ended up focusing on 5 that I can trade in any market condition effectively - covered strangle, ratio short strangles, ratio diagonals, long single options, short single options.

**Last Week –** After a down move to start the week the SPY was higher by about 2% last week, in line with the 2.1% move options were pricing. That’s 2 straight weeks of moves in line with option pricing following 3-4 weeks of moves that far outpaced option pricing.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing a 2% move for the upcoming week.

**Implied Volatility / VIX –** The VIX closed the week below 25, down from 27.50 the week before. Implied volatility is now approaching early June levels. The VIX futures curve is now upward sloping to the end of the year with Sept, Oct, Nov and Dec futures still above 28.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **2%** (+/- $8)
* QQQ **2.6%** (+/- $8)
* IWM **2.5%** (+/- $4.50)
* DIA **1.7%** (+/- $5.50)

### In the News

After the close Friday news broke that Elon Musk is trying to back out of his deal to buy Twitter (TWTR). This was not a huge surprise to the markets as TWTR was already trading -35%+ to its announced deal price. The stock was down an additional 5% after hours Friday. Tesla (TSLA) stock was higher last week, and was up after hours Friday on the news. The stock had not performed well since Musk’s TWTR takeover was announced and investors in TSLA seem happier without the distraction. Tesla stock was near $770 after hours on Friday, up from $680 the week before. From last week:

&gt;TSLA stock is trading near the same price of a year ago and is down about 45% from its all time highs above $1200. Options, which have underpriced moves in the stock (higher and lower) during its large swings of the past year are now pricing about a 15% move for the rest of July and about a 35% move by year end.

TSLA already made the move options were pricing for all of July before the calendar hit the 9th of July. It’s now pricing about an 11% move for the rest of the month.

The Musk / Twitter news may have been portrayed as a surprise over the weekend in the media, but clearly markets weren’t pricing a big chance of it happening. TWTR options were pricing a bullish consensus of about $46 in the stock out to December, well below the announced takeover price. The bearish consensus in December is about $25:

For more info, I use the volatility smile option in the calculation settings. I noticed a few odd things.

1. If you try to build a box spread using the prices at any 2 strike points the total always adds up to the difference in strike prices, which would imply an interest rate of 0% on the box.
2. If you plug in the provided estimates for implied volatility, strike price, etc. into black-scholes it provides different results than the price estimates on thinkorswim whether you use 0% interest rate implied by the box or if you use treasury rates at the same maturity as the option.
3. The only variable not provided in the app is the interest rate used in the calculation, so I also used a black-scholes model to back out what the interest rate would have to be for the black-scholes' price to match thinkorswim's estimate. I got significantly different numbers for the call and put options and for the higher and lower strikes.

Does anyone know what model thinkorswim uses for the theo price estimates, and what reasons there could be for these discrepancies?"|0.6|1|0|1

I'm strictly generating profits from the net gain in premium. I know some options traders take issue with how I'm day trading options, 0-3 DTE, MKT orders, blah blah blah...but I'm not looking for feedback on my trading strategy. It works extremely well for me and I'm consistently ***blowing away*** my daily profit goals.

Now my topic: I sometimes take large positions (100, 200 contracts) on A+ setups in order to maximize the profit potential (and yes I know that increases risk). But a trading buddy of mine says that he keeps his positions small so he doesn't show up in the options flow. From my perspective, I don't see a downside to my larger orders showing up in the flow. The intraday option price is largely driven by the underlying price action, option strike, DTE, the Greeks, and IV. To my knowledge, the volume of buy/sell orders does very little to affect the options price on a minute-by-minute basis, so whether the flow shows a 10-contract order or a 200-contract order, I don't see how there's a material pricing impact as long as there's enough liquidity to fill the order with minimal slippage.

Target $40-$50 within 1.5 years.

2008 meltdown was due to many circumstances, including Mortgage Backed Securities.
In 2022 or 2023, one of the problems is the Crypto backed Mortgage backed Securities.

I know so many people that refinances their homes and they went all in to TSLA and cryptos. Once margin called, they will lose their homes

So many to discuss. Rising inflation, rising rates, individuals took a huge debt and over leveraged, many businesses would borrow money. Everyone thinks that they are making money when borrowing with rates lower than the inflation rate 8%. The world will come down just like 2008, 2000 dot com bubble (crypto bubble now).

I like the idea that futures options probably carry a tax advantage for me, but they always seem to have a spread of $0.25 - $1 on the most liquid futures options. 

I really don’t see that value for me and the spread makes it difficult in terms of liquidity, especially when compared to an equity option that has a bid/ask spread as low as a penny. 

What are your thoughts here? I’d love to hear from anyone who actively trades these and what your broker is (maybe some brokers provide spreads that are tighter?).

Primarily, I want to share how I'm reducing risk and increasing my sensitivity to spot prices to exit at a profit sooner that I could if I instead held the underlying outright. 

On 29 March 2022, I entered into a short put position in IWM when it was trading around $210. On 31 March, I added another tranche with IWM around $205. Since then, I've managed this trade through a 48 point/23% drop. This is not the ideal scenario for this trade, however, the market doesn't care what I want it to do. It's my job to navigate it and make money regardless.

For context, below is a 1-year daily chart of IWM:

On 6 June, I took (2) separate short put trades in IWM that were ITM and rolled them into 1 series. Otherwise, let's get into the adjustment. That left me with (14) 22Jul 179P @ 4.45 credit. See Trade 1 below:

Today (7 July), I rolled this position down and removed size. I'm continuing to aggressively manage this position to permit and exit and ultimate redeployment. I reduced risk in 2 primary ways: rolling down (decreases the basis on each contract by 5 points) and by removing 1 contract (moving from a 14 to a 13 lot). Both of these adjustments combined reduced my risk \~ 10%. I will continue to manage this position until I take it down for a profit and regain sensitivity to spot pricing to re-deploy capital."|0.56|1|0|1

 1. Have a plan &amp; stick to it
 2. Control your emotions
 3. Cut losers early/Let the market show you how much profit there is. 
 4. Never go all in

More context — The way my smooth brain thinks — say the stock pre-split price is 130 which would mean it would trade at @32.5 post-split. Similarly, I assume a ton of the deep OTM call options strikes would divide by a factor of 4 and the # of contracts would multiply by the same. Also, since the options would be more affordable, a lot more folks would be able to YOLO into deep OTM calls (which is btw normal behaviour with GME)

Would this increase the density of contracts in the $0 to $100 range, which would in turn, set up a smooth gamma ramp, which would blow up when GME rips the next time (whenever that might be)? — (the MM’s would be delta negative and would have to buy shares to stay delta neutral)

My understanding is that the post-split situation of GME would look more like the pre-squeeze period in Jan 2021 (and late 2020) where most of the deep OTM options bought and sold were in the $0-$100 range. If all the speculation above is true, we might end up exactly like we did in Jan 2021 with highs of $480 post-split

My understanding of gamma ramps might be completely flawed — in that case, please enlighten me with some wrinkles.

Note — I realize that a lot of the options would have 0 volume due to funny numbers post-split. But, I hope we could safely put that aside for this question."|0.78|250|0|250

I have a basic grasp of understanding of options. I am wondering what I should think about and pay close attention to when I am looking to use puts to short stocks. I admit the part which confuses me is whether I should buy ITM or OTM puts. 

Let me put it into perspective. I have a short trade setup which follows my system with clearly defined profit taking targets. For example, I have a short entry price of $14.20 for a stock that is currently $13.60. I have a clearly defined profit level of $10.05, and another less reliable (but still fitting in my system) target at $8.19.

If I could borrow shares to short it would be easy. I’d sell at $14.20 with a stop at $15.60, and a profit target at $10.05 (take 25-50% off), move my stop to break even, and then look to close the position out at $8.19.

t3_vssfd6|1657120689|options|Managing undefined risk with regards to volatility|"Hey folks,

Been trading options for a while, mainly with defined risk strategies.  I've since started exploring and experimenting with selling naked options, mainly strangles.

I'm familiar with position sizing best practices such as only risking a max of 1%, but how are you handling that with a trade like a strangle?  

For example, let's say it's early in the trade, 45DTE and IV goes up and my position is now underwater at any point between my strikes.  Obviously, as time ticks on, it will recover into profitability (assuming it stays between the strikes), but depending on how much gamma exposure you have, you could be deeply in the negative for a good part of the trade until theta makes it a non-issue.

I'm struggling with closing a trade like this for a loss because of mechanics vs. 'going with my gut' and letting theta lift it back up.
