1. I have not seen proof of this, does anyone have proof / a link to a post WITH proof that this has happened?
2. I called Computershare to ask if I could put a security measure in place to make sure Computershare contacts me directly before accepting a request from a broker to withdraw my shares. Answer: **No.**
3. I then asked, well what is stopping my broker from removing shares from my Computershare account? Answer: **Your brokers security Policy**
4. What information do they need to pull shares out of Computershare account? Answer: **They would need your information (meaning all the info you would normally provide a broker name, address, and possibly your Computershare account number).**
5. I explained the whole reason I have DRSd (and possible others) is that I do not trust the system as it is, and as I AM the share holder with Computershare (not streetname) I want to be contacted before any shares are pulled and my explicit consent given via a security code. I suggested a simple notification should be sent to email/computeshare account about brokers trying to pulls shares, and a shareholder should have to put in a simple password that ONLY the share holders knows to allow this. I asked for this to be passed to her supervisor as well.
6. My thought process is sure, maybe not all brokers pull shares out, but what if one massive broker (lets say Fidelity) has a \`Glitch\`at that pivotal moment and it impacts everything (the same way not all brokers, but one giant APEX shut off the buy button). **Unprecedented things happen all the time, so if you have the same concern as my it would probably be a good idea to raise this concern as this could be a truly major illegal thing that happens that results in ZERO impactful consequence (like shutting of a buy button)**"|0.35|0|0|0

If you look at this graph:  


[DTCC US Treasuries FTDs](https://www.dtcc.com/charts/daily-total-us-treasury-trade-fails)  


I think is shows that they're naked shorting the US Treasury (how else would you FTD a treasury bond?)  $40B FUCKING DOLLARS PER DAY (avg)  


So, if you look at history...every major market crash is late September through mid October, which coincides with...  The Federal fiscal year turnover!  \[US gov't Oct 1-Sep 30\]  Is the end of days going to be triggered in a few weeks because something in the Treasury cycle happens?  


If you look at the example in the bottom of the DTCC link, you can add 3 zeros to it and see this is costing them MILLIONS to avoid GME mooning...

Today's run and then its immediate drop seems to have been healthy in that it may have been a sign of strength (SOS) followed by a retest. I believe that we are now moving into a back up/last point of support (BULPS). This ultimately, suggests that we will continue moving upward. I am guessing (according to the volume profiles) that this will continue moving into the $30 range and then retest $32. If we break above $32 and hold, we will likely see $36(ish) before the end of next week. 

Good luck everyone. I hope this helps some of you. :)


Edit:. I am posting the daily chart [here](https://imgur.com/a/ePd4hri) to make mention about our close and what this likely means for us moving forward. 

Given that our volume has been steadily declining and the fact that we closed with a dragonfly candle on the daily, I view this absolutely as a positive sign moving forward. The reason for this is bc after our spring event which pushed us back into the trading range, we needed to come back to retest our support level... We held and are prepared for continued markup. My hope is that starting tomorrow, we will see higher volume and bigger pushes. Nonetheless, if you are playing options, be careful and play the levels. DO NOT GAMBLE. 

Good luck everyone!!!"|0.76|20|0|20

t3_xcdjox|1662991096|GME|Financial freedom is not selfish|"Financial freedom is not selfish

Hey everyone, just wanted to share a little about myself and what I think about the current situation. I'm an ape that has had a lot of blessings in life- I have great supportive family members and friends. I've had the opportunity to get a good education and pursue my passions. I haven't struggled to the degree that many of you have- you all definitely deserve this squeeze more than I do and my heart goes out to all of you. Even still, I really want this to happen sooner than later. I've been patient for almost 2 years and need to see positive changes in the market where justice prevails.

I mean, there's got to be more to life than working a 9-5, coming home for a few hours, then rinsing and repeating. I know some of you work even more than that- 50 or 60 hour work weeks with long commutes. I love reading your stories and have mad respect for you kind and hard-working apes just trying to get by and provide for your families. I want this squeeze to happen soon for myself, of course, but also so I can give back to my loved ones and make their lives just a little easier.

I hate living in a system where a handful of elites make the rules and only enforce them on us commoners. I hate living in a system where these elites can cheat, lie, and steal and only get a slap on the wrist, if even that, while they profit off of our misery and suffering. They're a bunch of dragons hoarding wealth while looking at us ""peasants"" with disdain, ready to burn us and our homes to the ground as soon as we have no money left for them to take. They sit on mountains of gold, so large that they couldn't spend it all in several lifetimes, let alone their own. These people treat life like a game of Monopoly and laugh at our suffering. They don't give a fuck about any of us and it's about time that changed.

I know many of you aren't asking for much. A lot of apes talk about lambos and mansions, but from what I've read, most of you just want financial freedom- the freedom to not worry about how you'll pay your next bills, the freedom to pursue your passions and interests, and the freedom to give back to your loved ones and provide for them so they don't have to suffer. I want that too. Now, don't misunderstand me when I say that. Please hold as long as you want 'til your personal price point is reached, I know I will. I'm just saying that we're not like the dragons- we have hearts and want to use our money for good and altruistic purposes.

Don't let anyone- your families, friends, and certainly not the media tell you that you're selfish. Even if you use all your gains for the most stupid, frivolous things, you're thousands of times less selfish than the Dragons of Wall St.

Dragons are notoriously difficult to kill, and they're not going to give us the weapons or knowledge to do so. But we've found their weakness, and they're bleeding out as we speak. I have no idea when they'll die- the corruption of the U.S. stock market knows no bounds as we've seen over the last couple years and continue to see, but eventually, we WILL slay them and redistribute their wealth back to the people who deserve it. We know their tactics now, and they're boring. The fact that just buying and holding gme (and DRS ofc, I'm 100% DRSed) is crippling them while they continue to break the rules should tell you all you need to know. After this is said and done, we'll build a kingdom where everyone can thrive and support each other. Stay strong apes, and take care. 

TL;DR- Hedgies are dragons hoarding gold. Soon we take gold and dance on their graves"|0.95|100|0|100

That have daily stock market updates, without cherry picking data in favor of msm and shf

Mainly trying to avoid market watch, trading view, yahoo finance, fool, all the basic household names.

*Just thought I should share this overlay from the ’08 crash to where we are now.*

[’08 overlay from August 8 to March 5, ‘09.](https://preview.redd.it/o85if8mwx2n91.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66924ec65c0e1821a8870d7b328645186bd1e9af)

**Here are a few things this aligns with that are happening soon or are happening as of now.**

1. This graph aligns perfectly in time with the FTX US Tockenized Stock Market being released [Oct 1](https://help.ftx.us/hc/en-us/articles/7706072475031-Fee-Schedule).
2. Cohencidatally most crashes happen in October, which is the end of Q3 in the normal year.
3. Stole this from u/Criand in his ‘Black Monday’ dd, most crashes seems to start a little before or after quarter end, and again Oct 1 is when Q3 ends.
4. There’s also 1 tweet left from Ryan Conen that we are waiting for in September to finish off the 741, 7 tweets in July, 4 in August, 1 in September. Safe to say this could be the bomb we’ve been waiting for, as for what the bomb may consist of is up to you to speculate but imho he could announce... we’re moving away from the **DTCC** into a decentralized exchange (Loopring) or a centralized exchange (FTX US) with **TOCKENIZED STOCK.** He could also announce a 2-for1 stock dividend in the form of a split which will be given in the FTX US exchange an NFT DIVI. They could also back the tockenized stock in FTX by the amount of shares that SHOULD be in circulation which is \~305m.
5. I saw a post on SS explaining how someone in the Goverment of Ireland SUPPOSEDLY leaked the Goverment of Ireland was preparing for a total collapse of the stock market all around the world.
6. Many of you have seen this already, but the Vatican is also demanding that all of their assets be deposited to Vatican Bank by Oct 1. Here’s the  [link](https://en.protothema.gr/pope-decides-to-bring-all-assets-back-to-the-vatican/).
7. Aswell as the ETH Merge completing Sept 15.

*For those that are still unsure if tockenized stock would force shorts to close, I’m here to tell you it will (if they decied to go this route). Matter or fact all of these options would force shorts to close. 🔜GME*

NFA though, just wake me up when September ends BABAYYYYY.

t3_xasbn2|1662824211|GME|I just wanted to say the following regarding all of these “distractions” APE’s have been facing lately.|"Just because apes talk about something, dosent make it a distraction. Even if it’s not directly related to GME, no matter what we talk about, we continue to buy, drs, and HODL. That’s our focus, that’s what we DO. What we TALK about is just to pass the time.

There’s probably never been a more focused and determined core group of strangers like us. The little people banding together! Yet some think we’re “distracted”, when we talk MeMes or other news, and yet the DRS numbers continue to grow. There’s no distraction, we’re simply waiting. 

It’s not what we TALK about that matters,  it’s what we DO that matters!

It really is that simple.
Buy, DRS, HODL.

TINFOIL TIME BABAYYYY WAKE ME UP WHEN SEPTEMBER IS OVER.|"Don’t know if the post got much traction but a few days ago I saw a post from a guy  here on Reddit who’s friend has a friend in the Irish goverment. The OP explained that essentially the Goverment was preparing for a total market collapse in **OCTOBER**.

Which was what got me very excited. Many of you may know why, but for those who don’t here’s why, FTX US is launching a BLOCKCHAIN EXCHANGE on [THE 1ST OF OCTOBER](https://help.ftx.us/hc/en-us/articles/7706072475031-Fee-Schedule) (second bullet point).

 Not to mention October 1st is when Q3 ‘22 ends, and for those that don’t know what happens during quarters end. Here is u Criand’s [’Black Monday’ post that goes in-depth into this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o9aanm/black_monday_events_are_mondays_which_experience/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) 

I also saw a post (again here on Reddit) which I’ll come back and post the link if I find it but the OP describes how if you put ***ew eew llams a evah I*** from Ryan Cohen‘s [tweet](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1460127511619252230?s=21&amp;t=uD3vggLDj-Yv12UCXJpiHQ) in a word decryptor or random number assigned letters, you get  ***WAKE ME UP WHEN SEPTEMBER IS OVER.***

So CS gave all those GME shares to the DTCC to distribute but they never did. They just kept them and told all brokers to do a forward split.  This basically triples the number of synthetics out there in one step.

The part i haven't heard much about is what the DTCC intends to do with the shares they pocketed.

What stops them from giving the shares (yes giving) to the shitheads like citadel that are all massively short?  If they gave them to the hedgies on the down low, the hedgies could use them to close their most toxic shorts (the ones that break even at around $6) and unload a massive fucking bomb they've been sitting on.  I know that doesn't probably cover all their shorts but there are probably shorts that break even closer to $25 to $30.  And if that's the case, can't they just  let the price run up, then short a bunch of shares at like $45, knocking the price back down into the low $30's or mid $20's where they buy back (close those shorts), make a profit and then use that to close their next most toxic shorts and so on.  Rinse and Repeat until your able to average up your close price to near what the actual price is.. and you take a small loss closing out of your last shorts but nothing catastrophic.  No squeeze happens, and now there's a truckload of synthetics out there that weren't created by naked shorting thanks to the DTCC and so they never need to be bought back. We lock the float with DRS and nothing happens other than we prove lots of illegal fuckery but we already know that and the SEC isn't going to enforce shit so .. we're all left with just our DRS'd shares and nothing else. (I like the stonk so I'm glad I'd have them but still)

In my mind this whole thing since the beginning has been anchored by the fact that every shorted share would eventually need to be purchased back.. but now the DTCC has all those shares they never distributed, probably hundreds of millions, that were never purchased, and can be used to give back to the lenders and it would cost them nothing to do it and much of their short position would be closed.

So I'm hoping someone can explain to me how this can't be a thing.  I want this to not be possible but i wouldn't put this kind of desperate criminal activity past the DTCC/SEC/Hedgies and anyone else that stands to gain from it.  So aside from ""that's illegal!"" I'm hoping some of you more wrinkly brained apes can tell me how this isn't possible and a squeeze is untouchable.

Someone tell me this isn't possible..

Looks like they truly were running off mainframe era technology...

Anyone have the details on this? As far as I know, the costs of implementing SAP ERP is around 25+ million for a small enterprise. Integerating an ERP into a business is a great way to win in the data era.

However, it suprises me that its this late into the game and they're pivioting to an off-the-shelf vendor; I'd be curious to see how the ERP handles NFTs and whatnot.

I didn't see a thread here regarding this, and in another thread where I mentioned them using mainframe with production code from the 80s, it seemed many people doubted that fact...

Overall, I think GME is going to need to bring in more IT staff to manage this transition rather than trying to outsource to contractors.

If they want to build long term growth, they need the in-house developers for the platform, not contracting external vendors who'll copy+paste the code for other brick and mortars."|0.93|23|0|23

So I think I’ve figured out the meaning of 741. And to explain it, I need to explain what Gematria is. According to wikipedia, “Gematria is the practice of assigning a numerical value to a name, word or phrase according to an alphanumerical cipher.” 

There are a few ways to do this, but in its simplest form, A=1, B=2, C=3.. There are a couple of websites that allows you to input numbers and it gives you the corresponding words, or you input words and it gives you the corresponding numbers.

A few interesting ones to note..

- REDDIT = 33

- GAMESTOP = 33

- RC = 33

- MELVIN = 33

- B.U.R.R.Y = 33

- VLAD TENEV = 33

- JEROME = 33

- LRC = 33

Surely just coincidences, right? 

Let’s have a look at RC’s most iconic tweet..

- “EEW EEW LLAMS A EVAH I = 1740”

1740!! Could it be..? Maybe.. but what does the number 1740 reveal?

- “THE EFFECTS OF DECIPHERING GEMATRIA = 1740”

- “HE WHO SOLVES THE PUZZLE = 1740”

- “THE TRUTH CAN BE SHOWN = 1740”

- “THEIR PLANS ALWAYS FALL APART = 1740”

- “WE ALMOST REACHED THE FINISH LINE = 1740”

And the peak of the 2021 sneeze..
- “JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTH = 1740”

New hype date..
- “SEPTEMBER TWENTY SIXTH = 1740”

- “WAKE ME UP WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS = 1740”

And my favourite..
- “DRS = 174”

This isn't a positive sign for a growing company that has a long term future. When the asset value drops from $3.5 billion to $2.8 billion, something's up.

I don't hold any position in Gamestock, but this link came across my feed; https://investor.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2022-results

I'm curious how anyone could look at these numbers and think ""this is good"".

I think there's a lot of hype regarding one metric, but that metric doesn't really impact the long term stability of the company. At the rate they're burning value, the company will be underwater in less than 5 years, which is pretty sad given the memes generated from this company within the last couple years.

I'm curious how this company will survive long term honestly; they lose money on every digital sale and sneakernet game delivery is slower than over highspeed internet; which many of the games require highspeed internet to install updates anyway.

I just don't see the appeal behind investing in this company, nothing in these numbers say ""buy buy buy"".

Maybe I'm just looking at the balance sheets and numbers wrong, it's not like I'm an accountant or anything. However, I am familiar enough with GAAP thanks to the standardization across the industry. 

Hopefully someone here can explain to me how burning nearly $1 billion dollars of cash and gaining only $200 million in assets is a good thing?

Perhaps it'd be worth some effort to convert the report into a household budget to help others make sense of these numbers. For some reason, I feel as though transparency wouldn't be accepted."|0.18|0|0|0

[Unnamed Host]

Good afternoon and welcome to GameStop's second quarter, 2022, earnings conference call. Please note that certain statements made during the call constitute forward looking statements made pursuant to the [Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1345111/000119312509225453/dex99.htm), as amended. Such forward looking statements are subject to both known and unknown risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. These risks and uncertainties are described in the companies Earnings Release press, Earnings Press Release, and its filings with the SEC. The forward looking statements today are made as of the date of this call and the company does not undertake any obligation to update the forward looking statements. I will now turn the call over to GameStop's CEO, Matt Furlong. 


[Matthew Furlong]

Thank you and good afternoon everyone. I want to begin by reiterating the deep appreciation we have for our stockholder's unrivaled enthusiasm, passion, and support. As we work to transform GameStop, these remain unique tailwinds for us; Ones we always recognize and value. I also want to take this opportunity to thank everyone across the organization for bringing continued focus and intensity to our mission. Particularly during an active Q2 that represented a transitional quarter for us. 

Before covering the quarter's specific initiative and results, I want to provide a high level update on where we have been and where we are looking to go as our transformation progresses. When our board began turning over early last year, GameStop was saddled with significant debt, decaying systems, limited employee depth, and a host of other issues. This is why we spent the second half of 2021, and the first half of 2022, making up for years of under-investment and modernizing the business. The upshot is we now have a more diversified product catalog, strengthened fulfillment network, improved tech stack and e-commerce presence, and fortified corporate infrastructure. Thanks to these improvements, including our [SAP implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP_implementation)^** , we are able to start focusing on a new set of priorities that include achieving profitability, launching proprietary products, leveraging our brand in new ways, and investing further in our stores.

During Q2, we took steps to support each of these new priorities. With respect to pursing profitability in the coming quarters, we right-sized corporate expenditures, and head count, following a period in which the company had hired more than 600 new individuals. These actions, combined with the elimination of one time expenses in Q1, contributed to a 14.3% reduction in [SG&amp;A](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sga.asp). We have done this while improving our e-commerce experience and reducing free shipping to customers to 1-3 days. We are going to retain a strong focus on cost containment and continue promoting an ownership mentality across the organization. 

On the product front, our enhanced tech capabilities allowed us to follow the launch of our [digital wallet](https://wallet.gamestop.com/) with the launch of our new [marketplace](https://nft.gamestop.com/) that allows gamers, creators, collectors, and others to buy, sell, and trade NFTs. The launch of our NFT Marketplace supports GameStop's pursuit of long-term growth in the cryptocurrency, NFT, and Web3 gaming verticals. All of which we expect to be increasingly relevant for the collectors and gamers of the future.

When it comes to our creative partnerships, we have been actively exploring opportunities to strengthen GameStop's offerings and increase brand visibility. We are building on the momentum established by our previously disclosed partnerships with organizations like [Immutable](https://www.immutable.com/) and [Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/). Whether it be through new relationships that support our commerce business, blockchain group, or both. The deal we just announced with [FTX](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-forms-partnership-ftx) is a by-product of our commerce and blockchain teams working together to establish something unique in the retail world.

Lastly, when it comes to investing in our stores, we rolled out an improved compensation model for US Store Leaders. Each of these Store Leaders is being given a Time-Based Equity Grant of $21,000 that vests over 3 years, as well as the opportunity to earn additional compensation every quarter via a Performance-Based Equity Grant. In conjunction, we are raising hourly pay for certain Store Associates. These steps were taken to help with enhanced retention, and recruitment, of passionate, quality talent. 

When we think about the GameStop of the future, we expect our stores to help us maintain direct connectivity to customers and sustain localized order fulfillment capabilities across more geographies. This is why, even as we continue evolving our e-commerce and digital asset offerings, stores will remain a critical piece of the companies value proposition. Taken together, we believe the aforementioned steps can help us attain profitability in the coming quarters and produce additional revenue growth over the long term.

Let me now turn to our financial results for Q2. 

Net Sales were $1.136 Billion for the quarter compared to $1.183 Billion in the prior year's second quarter. Sales attributable to new and expanded brand relationships remains strong. It is also worth noting that sales attributable to collectibles, which is a segment we intend to grow over the long term, were $223.2 Million for the quarter compared to $177.2 Million in the prior year's second quarter.

SG&amp;A was $387.5 Million, or 34.1% of sales, compared to $378.9 Million, or 32% of sales, in last year's second quarter. As noted, we had a strong reduction in SG&amp;A on a sequential basis versus Q1 of this year and we are taking further steps to reduce SG&amp;A on a go-forward basis. 

We reported a Net Loss of $108.7 Million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to a Net Loss of $61.6 Million, or a loss per diluted share of $0.21 in the prior year's second quarter. There were no major one time transformation, transaction, or related costs during the period.

Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalence of $908.9 Million. We continue to maintain a sizeable cash position even while investing in inventory to sustain strong In Stock levels and mitigate the full impact of lingering supply chain issues. 

At the close of the second quarter, we had no borrowings under our [ABL facility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetbasedlending.asp) and no debt, other than a low interest, unsecured, term-loan associated with the French government's response to COVID-19. Total liabilities, compared to the second quarter of last year, were down $237.8 Million. [Capital expenditures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp) for the quarter were $20.5 Million, up $7 Million from last year's second quarter, reflecting investments in our technology and enterprise systems. We anticipate CapEx will remain at modest levels. 

In the second quarter, cash flow from operations was an outflow of $103.4 Million compared to an outflow of $11.5 Million during the same period last year. Inventory was $734.8 Million at the close of the quarter compared to $596.4 Million at the close of the prior year's second quarter.

In terms of an outlook, we are not providing formal guidance at this time. It is worth noting, however, that our ongoing engagement with key suppliers is positioning us to receive stronger supply of next generation consoles in the months ahead.

I want to finish by reinforcing that we are working to accomplish something unprecedented in our industry:

Transform a legacy brick and mortar retailer into a technology led organization that meets customer's needs through stores, e-commerce properties, and both digital marketplaces and new online communities. Our path to becoming a more diversified and tech-centric business is one that obviously carries risk and will take time. This said, we believe GameStop is a *much* stronger business than it was 18 months ago. I will leave it there for this quarter. We look forward to driving more progress in Q3. Thank you.

This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

&gt;Good afternoon and welcome to the GameStop second quarter 2022 earnings conference call.

&gt;Please note that certain statements made during the call constitute forward looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995 as amended. Such forward looking statements are subject to both known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements.

&gt;These risks and uncertainties are described in the company's earnings release, press earnings press release and its filings with the SEC. The forward looking statements today are made as of the date of this call, and the company does not undertake any obligation to update the forward looking statements.

&gt;I will now turn the call over to GameStop CEO Matt Furlong.

Matt Furlong:

&gt;Thank you and good afternoon, everyone.

&gt;I want to begin by reiterating the deep appreciation we have for our stockholders unrivaled enthusiasm, passion and support as we work to transform GameStop. These remain unique tailwinds for us, ones we always recognize and value. I also want to take this opportunity to thank everyone across the organization for bringing continued focus and intensity to our mission, particularly during an active Q2 that represented a transitional quarter for us.

&gt;Before covering the quarter's specific initiatives and results, I want to provide a high level update on where we've been and where we're looking to go as our transformation progresses.

&gt;When our board began turning over early last year, GameStop was saddled with significant debt, decaying systems, limited employee depth and a host of other issues. This is why we spent the second half of 2021 and the first half of 2022 making up for years of underinvestment in modernizing the business.

&gt;The upshot is we now have a more diversified product catalog, strengthened fulfillment network, improved tech stack and e-commerce presence and fortified corporate infrastructure. Thanks to these improvements, including our SFP implementation, we're able to start focusing on a new set of priorities that include achieving profitability, launching proprietary products, leveraging our brand in new ways, and investing further in our stores.

&gt;During Q2, we took steps to support each of these new priorities with respect to pursuing profitability in the coming quarters. We right sized corporate expenditures and headcount following a period in which the company had hired more than 600 new individuals. These actions, combined with the elimination of onetime expenses in Q1, contributed to a 14.3% reduction. And we've done this while improving our e-commerce experience and reducing free shipping to customers to 1 to 3 days.

&gt;We're going to retain a strong focus on cost containment and continue promoting an ownership mentality across the organization. On the product front, our enhanced tech capabilities allowed us to follow the launch of our digital wallet with the launch of our new marketplace that allows gamers, creators, collectors and others to buy, sell and trade NFT. The launch of our NFT marketplace supports GameStop pursuit of long term growth in the cryptocurrency, NFT and Web3 gaming verticals, all of which we expect to be increasingly relevant to the collectors and gamers of the future.

&gt;When it comes to accretive partnerships, we've been actively exploring opportunities to strengthen GameStop offerings and increase brand visibility. We're building on the momentum established by our previously disclosed partnerships with organizations like Immutable and Blueprint, whether it be through new relationships that support our commerce business, blockchain group or both. The deal we just announced with FTX is a byproduct of our commerce and blockchain teams working together to establish something unique in the retail world.

&gt;Lastly, when it comes to investing in our stores, we rolled out an improved compensation model for U.S. store leaders. Each of these store leaders is being given a time based equity grant of $21,000 that vests over three years, as well as the opportunity to earn additional compensation every quarter via a performance based equity grant in conjunction or raising hourly pay for certain store associates.

&gt;These steps were taken to help us enhance retention and recruitment of passionate, quality talent. When we think about the GameStop of the future, we expect our stores to help us maintain direct connectivity to customers and sustain localized order fulfillment capabilities across more geographies. This is why, even as we continue evolving our e-commerce and digital asset offerings, stores will remain a critical piece of the company's value proposition.

&gt;Taken together, we believe the aforementioned steps can help us attain profitability in the coming quarters and produce additional revenue growth over the long term. Let me now turn to our financial results for Q2. Net sales were $1.136 billion for the quarter compared to $1.183 billion in the prior year's second quarter. Sales attributable to new and expanded brand relationships remain strong.

&gt;It is also worth noting that sales attributable to collectibles, which is a segment we intend to grow over the long term, were $223.2 million for the quarter, compared to $177.2 million in the prior year's second quarter as GNP was $387.5 million or 34.1% of sales, compared to $378.9 million, or 32% of sales in last year's second quarter. As noted, we had a strong reduction in June on a sequential basis versus Q1 of this year, and we're taking further steps to reduce SGA today on a go forward basis.

&gt;We reported a net loss of $108.7 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $61.6 million or loss per diluted share of $0.21 in the prior year's second quarter. There were no major one time transformation transaction related costs during the period. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $908.9 million.

&gt;We continue to maintain a sizable cash position, even while investing in inventory to sustain strong in-stock levels and mitigate the full impact of lingering supply chain issues at the close of the second quarter. We had no borrowings under our ABL facility and no debt other than a low interest unsecured term loan associated with the French government's response to COVID 19.

&gt;Total liabilities compared to the second quarter of last year were down $237.8 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $20.5 million, up $7 million from last year's second quarter, reflecting investments in our technology and enterprise systems. We anticipate CapEx will remain at modest levels in the second quarter. Cash flow from operations was an outflow of $103.4 million, compared to an outflow of $11.5 million during the same period last year.

&gt;Inventory was $734.8 million at the close of the quarter, compared to $596.4 million at the close of the prior year's second quarter. In terms of an outlook, we're not providing formal guidance at this time. It is worth noting, however, that our ongoing engagement with key suppliers is positioning us to receive stronger supply of next generation consoles in the months ahead.

&gt;I want to finish by reinforcing that we're working to accomplish something unprecedented in our industry, transform a legacy brick and mortar retailer into a technology led organization that meets customers needs through stores, e-commerce properties and both digital marketplaces and new online communities. Our path to becoming a more diversified and tech centric business is one that obviously carries risk and will take time.

&gt;This said, we believe GameStop is a much stronger business than it was 18 months ago. I'll leave it there for this quarter. We look forward to driving more progress in Q3. Thank you.

And then reading again and again) information and books on Wyckoffian approaches toward understanding the market environment. I am attaching my most recent analysis [here](https://imgur.com/a/jGCIRHQ)

My purpose in making this post is to encourage people to join me in trying to analyze GME and other meme stocks using the tool that is Wyckoff Analysis. My goal is to encourage regular dialogue about this such that we can learn from one another rather than falling susceptible to confirmation bias and group think bc these are bad tools and detrimental to our academic understanding of the markets. let's work together to better one another!!! 

Now, I understand that many of you already are rolling your eyes 🙄 about the application of technical analysis (in most any capacity) toward the meme stocks, but I want to provide and answer as to why technical analysis is actually an objective representation of market manipulation being put into practice. This is what Wyckoff schematics provide. They provide the psychology surrounding why it is that these events are happening. This is in contrast to blind acceptance to statements such as a ""head and shoulders"" pattern typically predict an upcoming downward move. The Wyckoff approach says that what is likely happening in a ""head and shoulders pattern is that there was likely some form of push upward followed by a buying climax (left shoulder), followed by a push downward known as the automatic reaction downward (e.g. people taking profits) which is then followed by another push up for a secondary test upward which may reach a peak known as an upthrust if we are in an overall upward general trend, and is known as an upthrust after distribution (UTAD) if we have been in a general downtrend (e.g. head formation). If it does not move any higher, this confirms the continued downtrend (distribution phase). The exception to this is in identifying whether there is a spring present which will inevitably propel the stock up from below the trading range and back into it and perhaps, even well outside of it to begin a new net accumulation phase. 

Overall, my point is that we can use this tool to predict meme runs and the more resources and people willing to participate, the better we become. Knowledge is power... EMBRACE IT!!! 

Tldr; markets are rigged, let's study patterns to predict and, more importantly, understand their motives behind their actions."|0.63|9|0|9

With no other companies or distractions on his agenda, he will concentrate on getting GME to grow more than ever. 
Lastly, with this price drop on this low volume and such a high short interest, as usual, GME will do at least a 10 day run up like usual as it will detach itself from the other company."|0.75|417|0|417

Over the weekend, my sister was outlining the august volatility incidents on meme stocks to my fam, and she described it as an insider playing his support base for a pump and dump, resulting in his now being under investigation by the SEC. 

(She was sharing Cliffs notes from the MSM, I know.)

I redirected the conversation that a multibillionaire like Cohen has no reason to engage in a p&amp;d, given that the risk-to-reward is nonsensical, considering he’d only be gaining a few million bucks against destroying goodwill with 500K or more investors in a company worth far more.

That ended the convo; however, I am sure this is not the last one of these to come. 

That being said , is there a pinned post of ongoing, outlined, specific events that exhibit Ryan Cohen’s character and aims? In the future, I’d like to be able to share a litany of evidence, based on specific events rather than conjecture."|0.92|27|0|27

I remember that all I need to do is buy and hold. My position isn't in any danger, I'm normally long term hold anyway so I'm not looking at the ticker every 5 minutes and losing my shit on red days. 

I remember that the shorts need to spend more money every time they reup their shorts. I remember how the fees for short contracts are getting higher and higher every month, and lendable shares are getting harder and harder to find.

I remember that even though I can only afford to buy one or two shares a month that the whales are buying thousands and thousands of shares every month, locking the float steadily but surely. 

Fuck, I remember when we weren't even 10% locked, now we're at 51%, that still blows my fucking mind.

I remember that Kenny boi is flying somewhere every month to get new $500 million dollar loans to keep his play a float. This is my favorite part, Kenny is literally going into debt to keep a short play going. That's like cutting off your leg one inch at a time to stop a poison snake bite.

I remember the DTCC committed international securities fraud by holding onto the shares they were given by CS and Gamestop, instead of giving them to the shareholders.

I remember how the shorts never covered.

And I remember that all I need to do is wait. Wait for them Tendieman, for he cometh."|0.96|68|0|68

This is big for GME's NFT marketplace, the former CEO of Riot Games Asia getting into the space should raise the eyebrows of anyone who's familiar with Riot Games. IMX's dealings with GameStop includes the onboarding of games Immutable has partnered with to the GameStop NFT marketplace. (I assume this will happen post-beta.)

I also find it worth noting that Riot Games is owned out right by Tencent, who dominates the gaming space and currently has over $1.5 trillion AUM. I know it's the former CEO of Riot Games, but Tencent also invested in Immutable X's latest Series C round. The way I interpret it is big players in the gaming and tech sphere have been quietly positioning themselves in Web 3.0, excited to see more large gaming conglomerates ink deals with Immutable X!"|0.96|582|0|582

Leaving aside the lack of respect for the dead individual, they forgot to mention the stock didn’t plummet when they sold, it plummeted the moment the SEC filings became public that they sold (how convenient- so selling didn’t do anything, but the news of selling did it- magic). I believe it’s time to ask the SEC what the darkpools are, after all. To my understanding they were a good thing because their role was to prevent large market volatility due to institutional/insiders selling large blocks of shares. So if this is the case and everything works as intended, why was there a need for articles stating how insider selling crashed the stock? It’s obvious to me that their darkpools don’t work as they “intended”, so perhaps it’s time to disable trading OTC for the “meme stocks” considering, well, it doesn’t really work anyway. Start being vocal and expose those parasites, this is literally an insult and a huge slap on our faces. I’m gonna write a formal mail to the SEC to explain this situation.|0.95|603|0|603

t3_x5e24x|1662266282|GME|A Vested Interest In The Future of GME(RICA): An Abridged Version (BoBBY/BaBY Acquisition Tin Foil)|"“Tell me of Perseus, Papa Noble?” (You)

“Come close my son and join me at the hearth. Listen well to my tale.” (Me)

Point One – Ryan Cohen and his ever expanding Merry Band of Badasses established a rally point in Gamestop via the turn around. They are using the Company as a vehicle for innovative change that probably should have already happened over the last 30 years.

Point Two – NFT Platform – Loopring technology integrating Inter-Planetary File System by Piñata in which every single piece of Intellectual Property has a specific serial number encoded thus prohibiting fraud or spoofing. Anything from a tree, a bottle of whiskey, or even a Stock/Security. Alpha &amp; Beta have been a Proof-Of Work to various titans of commerce, and you can expect reveals of integrating partners relatively soon.

If I had to hazard a guess, I would say that the Merry Band of Badasses (larger now) have acquired the meat and potatoes of Loopring as a corporation. They likely have purchased either License or the entirety of the Loopring Patent for a Blockchain Decentralized Exchange. This would give them leverage against anyone in Finance, or the Grubnerment trying to lean on them. This also hedges against corruption or cronyism via bureaucrats and politicians.

Point Three – Gamestop can act as an agent and trustee of another corporation. They filed with the SEC, and it was approved. (They have also registered GMERICA Entertainment LLC in many countries throughout the world, if you haven’t been paying attention. U.S., Canada, United Kingdom…) This means that Gamestop is free to restructure or reorganize their assembling conglomerate at will. This means that Gamestop (or GMERICA) will be a parent company like Alphabet is to Google. BoBBY or BaBY or Blockbuster (theorized that they were seeking a purchase from ATT/Direct TV who has done jack all with the Brand/I.P.) will all be divisions of the larger corporate entity.

Point Four – A Wild Speculation – Ryan Cohen is still working with Bed, Bath, and Beyond. He cannot own stock in both companies while pursuing an Acquisition or Merger. According to their Agreement, he can at any time purchase up to 20% of shares available to the public. If Gamestop doesn’t acquire all of BoBBY, they will be acquiring BuyBuy Baby. This transaction will force all direct and derivative action of BoBBY *and* Gamestop to be closed out. Securities and Stock Trades, Options, *Swaps*, and even *ETFs* will have to be settled. (Here, I can can either cash out here, during the short squeeze, or I can HODL for generational wealth.)

Gamestop has 304.52~ million shares available to the public as well as 5.00~ million preferred stock, and 8~ million Class A Common Stock available as compensation and incentives to their employees. We’ll say 318 million even. They still have a ceiling of 1,005,000,000 Class A Stock, leaving roughly 682~ million available for the Board of Directors to work with. What can happen in an Acquisition or Merger? Stock Distributions.

BoBBY| -&gt; GME + BoBBY = BoBBY Holders get GME Stock.

BoBBY |-&gt; BoBBY | BaBY  = BoBBY Holders get BaBY Stock.

“BoBBY |-&gt; BoBBY | BaBY|” -&gt; BaBY|-&gt; GME + BaBY = Certain BoBBY and BaBY Holders get GME Stock.

Tl;dr: [I bought BoBBY because Gamestop is either buying all of BoBBY or just BaBY. I am hoping that Gamestop buys a Carved Out/Spun Off BaBY so that I get to keep BoBBY, get BaBY, and then get converted into Gamestop so that I have multiplied moon tickets while having purchased BoBBY for pennies on the dollar.]( https://i.imgur.com/oV9iHdc.png)"|0.78|61|0|61

t3_x5dpe4|1662265130|GME|We knew this would happen|"It seems like a lot of us try to apply our moral values to the SHFs. We seem surprised when we realize that they honestly intend to tank the market and collapse the system rather than settle their tab when GME finally squeezes. But we should keep in mind that these are the same people who have been routinely death spiraling companies for years. Imagine where we might be now if the promising cancer research or tech start-ups might have had a chance to bring their products to market.

I fear that when the dust settles the biggest offenders will receive another bailout because they are too big to fail. I worry that there will be no jail time and that they will get another cost of doing business slap on the wrist at best, and may even get to acquire some of the small firms who do fail for pennies on the dollar, at worst. I hate these people. They are a scourge. 

u/ddcrx is dead-on correct. When a redistribution of wealth occurs we need to be better than these asshats.

But whilst it's good reasoning, it seems flawed to me - why would GME buy a company with big debt, with dodgy inventory management and needing an update to its footprint and supply chains?  To compete against Amazon, to meet customer needs is the general reply.

But surely a simpler approach is to expand GME (GMERICA?) to offer relevant products to the baby group, and just create your own setup based on your proven customer-facing approach, and your distribution networks. It'll take a little longer to gain the footprint, but it can be the footprint you want, negotiated at times when good deals can be had, and supplied by the system you have setup.  Seems simpler, cheaper, and more on brand.....

So maybe RC sold as he's decided to compete directly.  This doesn't mean M&amp;As are off the table, but it may be other under the radar companies to help achieve this....."|0.33|0|0|0

They replied:

&gt;**Will the FCA be sharing the details of this matter with the SEC?**  
&gt;  
&gt;I can confirm that we have a Memorandum of Understanding with the SEC which allows us to share information between our organisations. Whilst we can share information between our organisations with a view to assisting us both undertake our roles, were unable to share information with them on your behalf.

to which I have replied

&gt;You have, by your own account, information that demonstrates that UK brokers were instructed to treat the corporate action as a stock split, and not a stock dividend.  You have information that Gamestop announced and filed a stock dividend.  You therefore have evidence that the DTCC has acted in error in this matter.  I am not wanting you to pass information on to them on my behalf - I am wanting you to share the evidence that you have that an illegal action has occurred so that they investigate and take appropriate action.  
&gt;  
&gt;Put differently, I would like you to share the information on this case that you have uncovered to assist them undertake their role as regulator.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is like saying “yes, I see that you have evidence of murder, and we confirm that murder occurred, but the murderer is American and we don’t have jurisdiction.  And we are not going to contact the authorities on your behalf, even though we’ve confirmed its murder ourselves”.  I fail to understand the legal, moral or ethical stance you’re taking here.  
&gt;  
&gt;I appreciate I can pass the information on myself, but we both know that coming from you it will have more impact than coming from me.

I listed it in loopexchange but now I am seeing derivatives of my art collection even if I have not fully released it.

Even my second art collection, 4 Pets Play, I saw something vaguely similar to it. So maybe it was just a coincidence. I wanted 4 Pets Play to be released around the split dividend to stay with the 4 for 1 theme, but alas I am still waiting to be approved in the [nft.gamestop.com](https://nft.gamestop.com) marketplace.

As for my third collection, I have toned it down and I think I have found some sort of utility. I am struggling with it currently. It is hard to make. I have not leaked it yet. I am avoiding using loopygen because even though I think it is great, I got paranoid and thought maybe they got a sneak peek of what I was making before I even released it. But I still like loopygen

I want to express my deep concerns about ongoing attempts of the ECB and the ESMA to subvert and override the regulations of the European Commission, especially on the mandatory buy-in-rule in the Central Securities Depositories Regulation 909/2014.

We have a huge problem with a rising number of failures-to-deliver of shares in the stock markets. Failures-to-deliver result from an insufficient settlement discipline, in which sellers of shares (market makers and broker-dealers) are not forced to buy shares before or immediately after they sold them at the stock market. The lack of efficient settlement rules exposes markets and investors, especially retail investors to a highly asymmetric unfair risk and is a main risk factor for extreme faults in the stock markets. 

Because of the disastrous aftereffects of the fincancial crisis 2008 the European Commission has issued Regulation Standards on Settlement Discipline in 2014 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:02014R0909-20220622&amp;from=EN).
The European Commission has repeatedly stressed the importance of the mandatory buy-in-rule as a basic part of the settlement discipline (https://ec.europa.eu/finance/docs/law/220316-csdr-review-proposal\_en.pdf).

However, until now key elements of this regulation including penalties for market participants who fail-to-deliver shares, margin calls and mandatory buy-in rules are still not in effect, have been postponed and are planned to be postponed again for an undefined time period by the ECB (https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/en_con_2022_25_f_sign~5d1a092f24.en.pdf).

Even the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) votes for a delay of the mandatory buy-in rule to come into effect for an undefined period (https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma70-156-4963_letter_-_esma_to_ec_on_csdr_settlement_discipline.pdf).

This is unacceptable. 

Why are settlement regulations and especially mandatory buy-in-rules so important for us retail investors? 

The foundation of our economy are transparent and fair markets which follow the supply and demand rule. Settlement failures violate the supply-demand balance. Market makers have the right to generate temporary synthetic shares and to sell them like normal shares under the premise to go to the market and to buy back the same amount of real shares and replace the synthetic shares sold before within the settlement period. This is an outstanding important basic rule to secure the integrity of our markets. 

If this market maker obligation is consistently violated, market makers increase the number of tradeable shares (real shares + self made synthetic shares), dilute hereby the number of tradeable shares and cause a supply-demand imbalance. Failure-to-deliver leads to massive price suppression and destroys the value of the corresponding investments.

There is a large number of settlement failures or failures-to-deliver in the EU, as in many stock markets around the world. This means especially retail shareholders, who put money in the markets and buy shares of a company, buy in fact shares that are often not delivered! We retail investors are not able to recognize this, since there is no visible difference  between real shares and synthetic ones in our investment portfolios.

Due to the creation of synthetic shares by market makers, shares exist multiple times, at least twice during the settlement period. In fact billions of such synthetic, not yet delivered shares circulate in the stock markets. Without the settlement rules passed by the European Commission this status can last for an undefined period! (https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhm083 and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.finmar.2005.11.001)

If market makers have the right to sell synthetic shares to provide liquidity and are never forced to buy them back at the markets - this is in fact illegal naked shorting of stocks and puts an incalculable high risk to the transparancy and stability of the stock markets and exposes first and foremost us retail investors to an asymmetric risk, namely the devaluation of our investments. This is highly unfair. When we buy shares at stock markets we trust in broker-dealers to get real shares and not synthetic ones.

By postponing the Settlement rules again and again and again  I see a huge threat to my rights as a shareholder and a consecutive depreciation of my investments and I will not accept this!

It is first and foremost up to the ESMA, the ECB and the European Commission to protect my rights as a retail shareholder now!

1.) I want the Regulation Standards of Settlement Disciplines from 2014 to fully come into effect  immediatly without any further delay and exceptions!

2.) Namely I want an immediate stop of penalty exceptions for market participants who failure-to-deliver  and margin calls!

3.) I want mandatory buy-ins and we want it now!

I‘m awaiting your response asap.

Yours sincerely

Couple bucks here and there from us could get her a pretty sweet gaming PC from GameStop.

I posted an account that got and sold like 54 of the 711 available cape nfts. Regardless of your thoughts on this, consider why its a beta in the first place. After a suggestion, i emailed the evidence and frustration to the blockchain support team and received this email. 

For those of you saying to stop complaining because its a beta, consider that that is exactly the right time to complain. You know, before its fully released. Don’t expect it to work great but also don’t hush all commentary or call them shills. 

If you don’t really care about nfts, like myself really, you should still care about the customer experience of a service the company you are investing in provides. If nfts became something other than just jpeg art, would you want someone scalping all of your game skins, cards, or characters for example?"|0.93|52|0|52

Could this be related??? Need wrinkly brains to weigh in!|"It's been many years (like never that I remember) where multiple large banks were raided...especially for a share-trading scheme.   The first thing I thought about when I saw this was the German apes complaining about not getting their Gamestop dividend shares.   Unfortunately I'm too smooth brained and currently too busy at work to dive in to see if there is a connection.

But I did want to get this news out out to the group since I have not seen anyone else post about it.

I'm starting to think that Ryan Cohen has a role in some kind of massive sting operation to expose and take down corrupt people and firms on Wall Street.   It seems like everything he does the hedgies try and counter which exposes their crimes to the world more and more.  His moves definitely seem to be very calculated.   Also interesting to know that JP Morgan is mentioned here and they are affiliated with the loan that Bed Bath and Beyond acquired 🤔

Maybe it's just wishful thinking on my part...or maybe RC is part of the biggest retail revenge story in Wall St history.

 I actually think he is part of an even bigger plan...but some of you aren't ready for that yet.  

IYKYK.

Fuk the hedgies.

Not here for that, but it got me thinking.. we should be annoying at this point. Why not? Coordinated mailing in of our GME purple rings to the SEC, white house, etc. Make it so annoying they have to do something even if its just report on it. Its totally harmless in theory. A regular harry potter mail situation. It would cost almost nothing to be a total bother.

Edit: it sounds kinda silly right? like ""oh imma write a letter"" but if 10% of 800k holders send something in its 80k letters. it's at the least an inconvenience for their offices that takes almost no time out of your day.

The way i see it for most of us who held through the buy button, through the 40 dollar slam down, for nearly 2 years of bull have basically put it all on black, hit black, and then the casino went ""uhhh actually that doesn't count"" and rerolled us but now they just keep the ball spinning indefinitely No on is coming for us, no one cares (other than RC). We've gone through what seems like a dozen 100% ""catalysts"" only to wind up with a new ETF. ""DRS is the only way"" maybe.. until we DRS and some new crime comes up because were just a silent bunch of apes in ""chat rooms"". Could it happen on its own? maybe. Would it take the fall of society to do it? seems like it lol.

So I got to thinking. End of month is today. Margin calls tomorrow. Supposedly. If I’m bankrupt, and I know I’m bankrupt, and my death is tomorrow, why would I need to do anything today? I just stop trying and say whoops and I lose my job and I might as well start drinking cuz I can’t afford cocaine anymore and maybe I’ll go visit the dumpster behind wendys cuz my wife is leaving me and no one will give me a job because all my friends lost their jobs on the same day too and are with me eating 3 day old sun mayo behind the dumpster.

Hear me out, if we are all about price discovery, free market, supply and demand then this is nothing but that (convince me otherwise). So called ""scalpers"" are just traders at the end of the day. Sure, it feels unfair that you and I didn't get to buy even 1 of them due to errors and bugs but whoever got it just got lucky and had the money to spend. Now, they are just playing the supply and demand game. If you're crying about it then what's the point of price discovery and free markets. Dont pay them that much if you're so worried of ""scalpers"". Wait for it to either drop down or just watch it go up. It's all about price discovery and what people are willing to pay.

I'd encourage y'all to write to Gamestop about the errors and bugs in their recent drop.

But I think I may have an idea why they have done this.  They are now clearly in the business of creating GIFs and offering them on their marketplace - it's a core part of their business model.  They get both creator fees and transaction fees from the selling and on-selling; it's a perfectly legitimate business model.  Like me opening an art shop and selling my artwork, plus other people's too.  Why does this matter?

Because when they offer an NFT artwork as a dividend, they are not operating outside their core business, so are not manipulating any market, they are just offering a usual product to shareholders.  So it makes an NFT dividend much more core to their business.

And for all the legitimate shareholders out there, they get their NFT GIF as they should do, and as they might expect from a company who is in the business, after all, of making NFT GIFs.  No manipulation, no going after anyone, just legitimate business.

(link here [to previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/wrnh3v/uk_fca_confirms_dtcc_filed_gme_corporate_action/))

I've now filed a complaint with the same information in to the IC3 centre in the US (Internet Crime Complaint Centre) with the relevant emails and information attached.

Summary: I was defrauded by the DTCC though them coding the dividend as a split.  It's not likely to be the straw that breaks the camel's back, but is at least a straw.  If others can file complaints too, either ti the FBI or the IC3, then it'll all help.  I chose the IC3 because in the UK, it's more an internet crime than anything else.....

And my mind is trying to wrap my head around what has transpired in my favorite companies stock price. Here is what I have come up with for Gamestop and how this has played out, as written by a first grader. 

1. Media, financial advisors, government, parents, smart people - they shouted from the rooftops “be an investor and put money into the stock market: this will give you financial security!”
2. Somehow a bunch of simple minded dumb dumb stupid heads with a cumulative IQ of 7 listened. 
3. The above mentioned morons started buying a company that they thought was undervalued, offered great potential, and could provide great returns. *This sounds like they were investors*
4. Nothing happened
5. Nothing happened
6. Nothing happened
7. The stock price appreciates. Everyone mentioned in point one starts freaking the fuck out. It is now a meme stock. We know better than you. Everyone Is going to be hurt. Retail is manipulating stock prices. You are hurting the market. You are gamblers. It is time to sell. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. 
8. No one sells. There is mass confusion because we did what you said? Why do you hate us? We are investors like you! 
9. The buy button is turned off. They are protecting us from liking the stock. 
10. Mass freak out by idiots who like the stock so much that due diligence and deep dives become a full-time second job. 
Note: no one sells. 
11. The imbeciles discover that it is all a sham. They buy more. 
12. They keep buying.
13. They refuse to stop buying. 
14. The mass of degenerates decide to invest in something new. They decide to invest in the destruction of the financial system as we know it. They do this through the direct registration of their shares. Their primary life achievement is now a piece of paper that says their name and an institution (fuck college), GameStop.
15. Mass pandemonium sets in as the group of morons is registering shares at an unprecedented level. The ultimate buffoon has now become the ultimate investor. 
16. Everyone listed in Point One refuses to acknowledge anything going on in reality, instead continuing to argue that they know better than us and that we are not investors. 
17. The investment has become the best return in the market with significant upside potential. No one but the poors see this. 
18. We keep buying. We keep registering. We keep having fun. Sometimes we gain a wrinkle. Mostly we kill brain cells. 

Obviously a toddler wrote this and should not be trusted, especially not for financial advice or wisdom. No one proofread it, and no one even would think this is comprehendable. My friends and family make me wear a helmet and point at pictures and hide the crayons and chalk. 

I love you all."|0.93|48|0|48

t3_x1adff|1661836183|GME|Price Discovery|"Just wanted to share some thoughts on Gamestop / it's price discovery and get a discussion going.

I've been thinking about how price discovery works for tickers like GME when Market Makers / Internalizers can provide ""infinite liquidity"" (Doug Cifu, Virtu). I used to think that Market Makers could arbitrarily assign prices to the stocks but now I think the price is primarily driven by institutional traders / investors as they move registered shares.

Per the SEC (Gary Gensler's remarks at a conference this year [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-piper-sandler-global-exchange-conference-060822](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-piper-sandler-global-exchange-conference-060822) ) the vast majority of retail trades (over 90%) are routed through wholesalers. As noted by Doug Cifu of Virtu (one of the wholesalers managing retail trades) Market Makers are able to provide nearly limitless shares of a security at or below National Best Bid and Offer ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K064hJQ7fdI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K064hJQ7fdI) start around 3:10). My understanding of how they are able to do that is by internalizing the trade - meaning they keep the order for the shares internally (the trade doesn't make it to lit markets). They then keep a ledger with your position and credit you the difference when you sell those shares later.  

Now, price discovery should be a function of supply / demand. As the shares become harder to locate and the demand increases the price should also increase. It sure doesn't look like Gamestop is following those rules however, so what is happening?

From the Doug Cifu interview. 

1. Market Makers can create ""infinite liquidity"" . 
2. The price for these provided shares is at NBBO or better

If price is a factor of supply and demand, and here we are told supply can be infinite (at the behest of the market maker) at the current market price (or better) then it follows that the Market Maker has the ability to suppress the price by oversupply. 

NOTE both of these have the effect of suppressing price discovery for RETAIL DRIVEN trades which are routed through the Market Maker.

So where does the price actually come from? 

I'm not sure but I think it's actually from activity on the LIT exchanges. Lit exchanges are where the larger shareholders' (institutions, insiders) trades occur. Since THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY REAL REGISTERED SHARES, so supplying orders for registered shares forces a real transaction to occur (moving the registered shares from one investor to another). This is different from an internalized order (again over 90% of retail \[our\] trades) where there presumably is no actual exchange of registered shares. 

Knowing that there are two things that retail traders do that most likely can improve price discovery. The first is Direct Registration of Shares as this forces real shares to be issued for the position (and thus forces a transaction with the real shares). The second is using directed trades to route through IEX. IEX is an exchange which places the order on the lit market. When orders are on the LIT market it forces wholesalers to compete with the other exchanges for the transaction and helps to prevent internalization (improving price discovery). 

TL;DR

Retail is investing with monopoly money / fake shares except when they DRS or do directed trades (e.g. through IEX). Both DRSing and routing through the lit markets improve price discovery.

Market Makers are likely suppressing the price and having a significant effect on it, however I believe it is mostly by blunting the buy pressure from retail (through internalization).  Meanwhile the major determinants of price at this moment is action happening on the LIT markets (institutional investors / insiders)."|0.9|29|0|29

There was a post awhile back with a CNBC graphic that showed more than 2 in 5 Americans bought meme stocks. This was based on a survey conducted by Ally (link to article below)

[https://www.ally.com/do-it-right/amp/trends/one-year-anniversary-meme-stock-investors/](https://www.ally.com/do-it-right/amp/trends/one-year-anniversary-meme-stock-investors/)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1splxe8g7jk91.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e07685b5a7b87c012890ae16202aa4e0ba2a30fc

This is my attempt to breakdown the survey to show what it means in relationship to GME (Spoiler: we own the float). I am open to feedback but just thought someone needed to take a closer look at this data. Also, I did not have a lot of time to proofread everything so please be kind. I am also sure the formatting will be weird since I do not know how to use Reddit at all. 

Survey Source: Ally Consumer Research Survey

Survey Date: January 2022

People Sampled: 2,000+

I am not going to pretend I know a lot about margin of error, but 2,000+ people should give fairly precise results. Based on my short research, the margin of error should be somewhere around 2% (at a 95% confidence interval). We can assume these results are fairly close to actual numbers. One thing we have to assume is the survey did a good job of accurately representing the entire U.S. population. This is based on survey methods and is out of our knowledge. Just something to keep in mind.

There are 258.3 million adults in the United States based on the 2020 census. 

[https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/united-states-adult-population-grew-faster-than-nations-total-population-from-2010-to-2020.html#:\~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20U.S.%20Census,from%20234.6%20million%20in%202010](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/united-states-adult-population-grew-faster-than-nations-total-population-from-2010-to-2020.html#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20U.S.%20Census,from%20234.6%20million%20in%202010).

The survey concluded that more than 40% (2 in 5) people invested in meme stocks. That equates to 

103.32 million people invested in meme stocks

The Ally article only names three meme stocks; Movie, BB, and GME. The survey could have encompassed more “memestocks” than those three stocks, but I am going to make an assumption that it did not or they likely would have mentioned them. 

I am now going to break this down into a conservative approach and my estimate to give us two final numbers. Think of the conservative approach being the lowest numbers possible based on this survey. 

Now we all know GME is probably the highest own stock out of the three listed, but to be conservative let’s say GME was only 33.3% (1/3rd) of the people invested in meme stocks. I am going to add my estimate as 50%.This is just based on how these stocks gained traction in Reddit.

Conservative estimate (CE) = 34.44 million people invested in GME

My estimate (ME) = 51.66 million people  invested in GME

47% of the people invested less than $500 (smaller investors)

CE = 16.19 million smaller investors

ME = 24.28 million smaller investors

53% of the people invested more than $500 (larger investors)

CE = 18.25 million larger investors

ME = 27.38 million larger investors

It goes on to state that 79% of the smaller investors are still holding and 95% of the larger investors are still holding. This does not go into whether they are holding more, less, or an equal number of shares. It does say that 53% are planning on buying memestocks again in the next 12 months. Here is where I make another assumption that they are holding the same amount of shares.

CE = 12.79 million smaller investors still holding

ME = 19.18 million 

CE = 17.34 million larger investors still holding

ME = 26.01 million

The investors under $500 likely bought at least one full share at the time. This would equate to 4 shares now. It is probably more than 4 shares since that is only $120 at the current price but I want to stay conservative with my estimates. My estimate is going to be 8 shares (2 shares at the time). This would equate to $240 dollars at the current prices, which is close to the midpoint of the range of $0 - $500 invested.

CE = 51.16 million shares still held by smaller investors

ME = 153.44 million shares still held by smaller investors

Larger investors are people who invested more than $500.

It is hard to get an estimate on how many shares that would equate to. Once again we have to make some conservative assumptions. The survey said people were equally likely to make or lose money. Since the price was \~$100-$150 during the time of the survey we can assume that the cost basis for investors is somewhere in this range. I am going to use $125 because it is the midpoint and evenly divisible by 500. This would mean each large investor bought at least 4 shares (16 today). I used 16 as the conservative estimate. For my estimate I used 100. My reasoning is that our DRS bot says 400 average. We can assume these are mostly diehard investors so I wanted to be at about 25% of that number. This is probably still a conservative estimate but I was not sure how to approach this number.

CE = 277.44 million shares still held by larger investors

ME =  2.60 billion shares still held by larger investors

So using my CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES there are 328.6 million shares held by retail. This is greater than the number of shares issued.

My estimate is that there are 2.75 billion shares held by retail. This is only 9 times the issued shares…

I also want to look at this a different way. Based on our DRS data, there are 77 million shares owned by 190,000 people (accounts). There are 77 million shares remaining to lock this thing up. This means that the remaining 17.15 million (conservative estimate) larger investors (&gt;$500) have to own 4.4 shares each to lock the float. This is just $132 based on today’s price. It is highly likely we own the float.

One take away from this DD I want to demonstrate is that the conservative estimate is 30 million people holding GME. I know this number seems unrealistic (even to me). If this number is even close to being correct it is extremely bullish to GME. This survey does appear to be another data point confirming our original DD is correct and that the shorts never closed. Even the fact that the 82% of the people still hold and 53% saying they are going to invest more. If 82% of the people never sold, then how did they exit all their short positions? Especially if over half the people are still buying memestocks…

This is only taking into account U.S. holders. 

Remember the margin of error in this survey (2,000+ ppl) is around 2%. There are a lot of assumptions I made but I tried to take the conservative approach. I am open to feedback and review. I hope any mistakes are pointed out so I can correct them.

TL;DR 

U.S. Retail owns the float based on a survey conducted by Ally.

Conservative estimate is retail owns 328.6 million shares. It is likely in the billions."|0.92|16|0|16

I tag this as ""Fluff"" as I have very little motivation to do actual thorough DD but this analysis ain't shite either.

I do, however, leave you, with some reasons to believe the transformation is well under way.

FUNKO reported on 08/06. QoQ Vs. Y-Ago, Sales Comparison indicates they're up 24, or 80 Million dollars. H1 22 Vs. 21, they're up 47%, or 200 million dollars.

Gamestop is their primary retail partner, it is safe to assume that at least 50-60% of Funko's total sales are through their GameStop (I suspect this estimate to be quite conservative).

Growth in Funko Sales are across their multiple segments but I draw particular attention to Loungefly. Loungefly now represents over 22% of Funko's total sales, up from 13% in comparison to same period Y-Ago. Loungefly is primarily licensed wearables (think backpacks).

I suspect this is why Gamestop is leaning into the back to school promotion at the current moment but at a larger scale, why they're leaning into physical toys, boardgames and such at an increasing rate.

In the short term, these increases in collectibles sold at Gamestop puts them dangerously close from a break even quarter when you also factor in recent reductions in labor and other SGA.

While we've seen gamestop register trademarks for GMErica (apparel) and GS Kids, no formal announcements have been made by the organization as of yet.

With the combined positive trends in their existing toy, collectible and wearable lines, I anticipate the focus of the organization to shift here in the short term, be the source of the primary speaking points during the earnings call while also being the driver of a positive surprise earnings call next week. I would anticipate the formal announcement of their expansion into toys via acquisition or the development of new store segments (AKA, standalone Gamestop Kid sites). I anticipate the creation of standalone non-GameStop sites (think buybuybaby for B.B.B.Y, Old Navy for the Gap) as an alternative way to manage decline (and perhaps spur growth) at their non-expiring lease contracts.

This isn't financial advice. I literally couldn't bother myself to do a deep dive here to save my life. But these bullet point numbers look good and I suspect this is where their head is at currently in terms of priorities and focus.

TL:DR Fidelity sent an email about understanding stock splits. I replied.

Title of Fidelity article:  [Stock splits: What you need to know](https://click.fidelityinvestments.com/u/?qs=c3184e3fc24262834b6f1e5bb02fa67405c13a403b4a3a307966f2acc6d74331c844a7b13a3165320e3fa1e17e0cbbee3aae7efcc3681fd5e06f9977205eb3bf)

My response:

"" This is actually a very important email of information. Specifically, my understanding of the situation is that GME's stock split via dividend was done as a forward split. This was not supposed to be a forward stock split as per GameStops own announcement and filings. As shares directly registered approaches 100% of the free float, any shares left with brokers will clearly be synthetic. If I was Fidelity, I would be looking into this, and demanding that the DTCC make a transparent accounting of shares as well as obtain a joint statement from Computershare that this was done correctly... which as far as I can tell, it was not, and as far as I can tell, it would not be possible to get a joint statement form Computershare, because Computershare will say that it was done incorrectly, if I am interpreting all of this right. Yikes, what a situation. Fidelity is too good of an institution to have any doubt cast on it by retail investors. Allocating some resources to investigating this (properly, not a shame of an investigation), and taking a stand against any wrongdoing would win the hearts of retail investors big time. ""

Not even sure if anyone will read it. I only 5% know what I am talking about. Might not have even gotten all of the terminology right. I always tell people IRL that I understand more than I can explain, but will give it a shot."|0.96|39|0|39

Why take any risk of losing your tendies? At least DRS a small % of your shares so your broker can’t totally screw you. Do your part to make history and lock the float!

We’re happy to help if you have any questions, concerns, or problems.

Keys to locking the float quickly: 

1. **We need to educate the masses outside of Reddit what DRS is, why they should do it**. There are tons of GME holders out there! 🙊

2. Apes with money tied up in **”other investments”, consider converting those to GME and DRS**. What other investment could possibly compare to GME?!?  Even IF others can squeze, they can’t squeze like GME and only GME has a massive turnaround plan. 

“But Miller I don’t want all my eggs in one basket. That’s why I have other basket stocks.” … Well, the only reason those other basket stocks MIGHT go up is because they’re tied to GME, so your eggs are still in one basket (at best)!

3. DRS your IRA with no tax event. 

4. Apes with shares in **Etoro, T212, and Freetrade : think about selling and re-buying elsewhere!!** It’s the only way to DRS with them! These 3 brokers will not transfer to another broker nor will they DRS. Why in the heck would you think they have shares?? They simply take your money and pay off your bet. Please don’t trust them!

If you follow AM C and that split, the dividend was in a new SHARE being created (APE).  As you might imagine, it was ""not smooth""... some people still have not received their dividend, and many people that have received it doubt what they were given.  


In the news, it was reported as 2:1 split, but for the life of me, I do not know why, because the APE shares are not AM C share and should be $0.01 give or take.  So, I started probing:  
(AM C/APE)

Fidelity split my shares 64/36  
Etrade 60/40  
Friend on Schwab 57/43  
A friend that had DRS'ed shares via Computershare 50/50 \* (a small price difference AM C $0.40 higher)  


And then, TSLA issues a 3:1 dividend split like GME?  I don't think EM is stupid... why would he copy RC's ""failed squizz play"" if it wasn't going to work?

none of this is financial advice.

I  haven't posted in a while, its - its been a crazy crazy time on my end -  only just got around to updating the dashboard - changes should reflect  in the next hour or so. Major changes outlined below should reflect  this weekend - but read on below as to why its causing such delays.

**There are 3 main phases of the update:**

* Phase 1 - right now - updating the dashboard with latest posts, (page 1 of the dashboard)
* Ingesting the rest of reddit data for posts and comments - gme related, and publishing that on page 2 and 3 of the dashboard

**An update on back ups:**

backups  are still running, but due to energy costs going up 5 fold almost  relative to 2 years ago, backups now run 2 times a week, not every day -  there is a non significant energy cost to process the data and at this  stage I can no longer afford to run them daily - which is also why I am  moving to IPFS for storage permanently- I will be making another post  about this if anyone wants to mirror the IPFS node.

I ask all who read this post to please submit a post that they see that is useful to [archive.ph](https://archive.ph/) and to [archive.org](https://archive.org/)  \- just copy the url of the post and submit - it takes 30 seconds to do  but if enough people do it it will help me a lot with archiving- as I  can then query the two archives if i miss something.

Equally,  due to energy costs, I will no longer be able to run my entire rig 24/7  as I used to, so the dashboard itself will update on a weekly basis  instead.

In the coming days, if you have seen my post - the dashboard will have 3 extra pages:

1-  the current page, updated to the latest post. with the top posts  getting an IPFS link - there are 1.4 million posts backed up so i am  focusing on first releasing the most important posts to ipfs to manage  storage and bandwidth.

2- an export of all posts from 2020 nov onwards to july 2022 - now with the updated scores so you can search for everything.

3-  an export of all comments from 2020 nov onwards to july 2022 - also as a  powerbi page - so that people can search for criands and atobitts  comments - and many other people- I will try and clean up so only the  top comments remain rather than the millions of ""this is the way""  comments.

the entire content is  coming from the reddit api - which is accessiblet to all and from  pushshift.io - who have been doing a stellar job of hosting everything  by the way.

Once the energy situation is somewhat under control I hope to resume bi-daily backups and more frequent posts.

**About DRS- Every international ape can drs - either through** [**giveashare.com**](https://giveashare.com/) (expensive) or following the guide on the drs gme site. - maybe expensive depending which broker you are with. Equally, as i  understand it every international ape who has access to he WISE app (aka  transferwise) outside the USA can purchase direct in computershare - so  there is minimal issues on that side.

The only requirement is to open a usa bank account within WISE and use that for any direct computershare purchases.

&amp;#x200B;

[example of the giveashare page - this enables anyone even without a brokerage account to get a computershare account for ANY share on that site. if you choose to - it can be gamestop.](https://preview.redd.it/k37wt06uc1k91.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97a4bcbc8441124611ed77b0caa13ab7df1bff80)

When DRS started, there were and are multiple routes to get shares drsd.

some  are cheap - aka move to IBKR or IG and go from there and we know of one  site that has instructions for each broker. - the drs gme site has  great instructions.

I wanted to give a shoutout to this site - [giveashare.com](https://giveashare.com/)  \- as its oneof the few sites where you can get yourself a computershare  account with minimal fuss - having seen the updated brokerage terms and  conditions and previous events from another post where a brokerage just  deleted the shares  - i feel that DRS should be the way for all  sharesholders - as its the one and only true way of ownership.

I aint selling shit and I hope that my backup efforts are / were useful to you all - and they arent stopping.

I  aint fucking leaving but I am going quiet while i figure out how to  afford the UK electricity bills and rising cost of pretty much  everything- especially with the number of machines that I have.

**What happens if the entire dd goes down?**

I have had this question asked multiple times - there are multiple avenues to the DD and to the content - [gme.fyi](https://gme.fyi/),  my site for example, and my dashboard - which will soon have IPFS  capable links. so the actual knowledge or the posts arent going  anywhere. there is [gmedd.com](https://gmedd.com/) which also seems to be up and running.

What remains to be seen is the forum element - some have suggested discord and other platforms if something happens.

stay safe out there yall

and  thank you for your support. I received more than enough hate via PM  from random people but I am choosing to ignore it and just carry on.

if anyone wants me to add anything extra or an extra page to the dashboard (or dashboards) - let me know, I'll try to accomodate

t3_wxu5gu|1661473285|GME|Why you should be bullish on GameStop's NFT marketplace.|"  

I've been into NFTs for quite some time now and have been following GameStop's marketplace roll out closely, below I will give some insight into what I think sets it apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Minting Process:*** 

GameStop’s mint process is akin to a “secondary” purchase as experienced NFT purchasers know it. Admittedly when I first saw this I found it strange, but later realized it’s important to remember a hefty percentage of GameStop’s audience has never purchased an NFT before. 

GameStop's marketplace keeps everything bare bones simplified and focuses on Web 2.0 consumer experience. So, let’s say I want to mint “X” NFT on GameStop, all I need to know is when they mint because the mint takes place on the GameStop site. I also do not need anything extra for gas due to how GameStop structures their mints, all NFTs are pre-minted!

Why is this crucial…? If the future of NFTs is gaming &amp; scaling to hundreds of thousands of NFTs per collection then we need an efficient way to mint &amp; transact them, GameStop solved this with their Immutable X &amp; Loopring partnerships allowing projects to pre-mint their collections for just a few dollars. 

This means no more $20,000,000 fuck ups like Gary Vee’s brother had with the “Vayner Sports Pass” where they literally just burned millions worth of liquidity in fees.

&amp;#x200B;

***Power to the Players… Literally:***

The decade and a half old motto has aged exquisitely following the marketplace release, with games like Illuvium, Gods Unchained, and more coming soon we can already see proof of concept. Not only will we be seeing great games onboarded soon, but what better brand is there other than GameStop to be positioned on the forefront of onboarding gamers to Web 3.0? 

GameStop moving into the NFT space restores “Power to the Players” through true ownership of digital assets. Today we play games like Fortnite for Ex. and buy skins that we can’t trade, have no IP rights, and ultimately don’t really own... There’re hundreds of other games that follow this same model, Fortnite just happens to be one of the most prolific. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Volume, volume, volume:***

This doesn’t really fit under what I think sets the marketplace apart, however I see way too many posts about the low Vol. It’s a beta and what you see on the marketplace currently is not the core vision of what the GameStop marketplace will have to offer. 

Majority of the projects on there are just art /community centric and have no utility, so before screaming about low volume look a few months into the future when awesome games that have millions of NFTs are trading on GameStop marketplace. Perspective is everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Community:*** 

One of the most difficult arts to master in the NFT space is cultivating a strong community, GameStop not only has a community of gamers, but apes that have banded together amid opposition. 

I can’t stress enough how big of a leg up this is, you guys aren’t just bringing an already established community closer, you’re also enticing buyers like myself that typically trade on L1’s to check out the GameStop NFT ecosystem. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Conclusion:***

GameStop’s NFT marketplace in my eyes is everything the leading “Gaming” focused marketplace should be, sure we need some fundamentals like filters, mint limits, etc. but it’s a beta. If you’re still on the fence I’d implore you to watch as the games are onboarded and the “Power to the Players” motto is seen to fruition!"|0.96|1007|0|1007

t3_wxq0cm|1661462759|GME|GameStop's Prospectus Supplement seems to have been misread by almost everyone. There's nothing here that allows GS to remove the DTC as a depository after 90 days.|"[https://news.gamestop.com/node/18961/html](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18961/html)

&amp;#x200B;

First, read BOOK ENTRY SECURITIES on page 15.

\&gt;&gt;**We may issue the securities offered by means of this prospectus in whole or in part in book-entry form, meaning that beneficial owners of the securities will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the securities, except in the event the book-entry system for the securities is discontinued. If securities are issued in book entry form, they will be evidenced by one or more global securities that will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a depositary identified in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to the securities. The Depository Trust Company is expected to serve as depository.** &lt;&lt;

So simply, book entry securities rest with the DTC, the expected depository.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;**Upon the issuance of a global security, the depository for the global security or its nominee will credit on its book-entry registration and transfer system the respective principal amounts of the individual securities represented by such global security to the accounts of persons that have accounts with such depository, who are called “participants.”**   

**Such accounts shall be designated by the underwriters, dealers or agents with respect to the securities or by us if the securities are offered and sold directly by us. Ownership of beneficial interests in a global security will be limited to the depository’s participants or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in the global security will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by the applicable depository or its nominee (with respect to beneficial interests of participants) and records of the participants (with respect to beneficial interests of persons who hold through participants).   &lt;**&lt;

If we issue shares, book entry securities go into your system and you, or your nominee, credit participants accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;  **We expect that the depository for a series of securities offered by means of this prospectus or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal, premium, interest, dividend or other amount in respect of a permanent global security representing any of such securities, will immediately credit its participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of such global security for such securities as shown on the records of such depository or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in such global security held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the account of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name.” Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants**.&lt;&lt;

Street name or beneficial owners should be credited after we credit you by way of customary practices.  I.e. if the DTCC always instruct a forward split in the case of a split via dividend, that's up to them.

&amp;#x200B;

\*And now the bit everyone seems to be mis-reading...\*  On page 16:

\&gt;&gt;  **If a depository for a series of securities is at any time unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as depository and a successor depository is not appointed by us within 90 days, we will issue individual securities of such series in exchange for the global security representing such series of securities. In addition, we may, at any time and in our sole discretion, subject to any limitations described in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to such securities, determine not to have any securities of such series represented by one or more global securities and, in such event, will issue individual securities of such series in exchange for the global security or securities representing such series of securities**. &lt;&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

If a depository (the DTC) is unwilling, unable, or ineligible to continue as depository, and we don't appoint one in 90 days, then we replace the previously issued shares with an equivalent - basically.

\*NOTE: TO CONTIUNE AS A DEPOSITORY\*

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck all about doing their job in a certain way, or as everyone thinks they should given the name and intent of a 'split via dividend'.  The above **literally** says: issued securities aka dividends are over to you, handle it as per your methods.  We will step in if you stop being a depository.  

By stop we mean are unwilling to be a depository, unable to be a depository, or ineligible to be a depository.  

That's all.

&amp;#x200B;

TL,DR - The 90 day 'mis-interpretation is rampant.  Nothing in the prospectus allows pulling of shares from the DTCC, or action of any kind in the event they may or may not have been distributed incorrectly.  The only important result, by GameStop's own legal wording, is that participants had them in their account.

&amp;#x200B;

The ONLY share 'recall' method is DRS.  If there are no securities (aka dividends) to be sent to the depository because they're all in your own name (ComputerShare) - boom. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Bonus: My theory is that the splividend was issued as a pre-cursor to an NFT dividend.  GameStop simply say ""nobody had any issues, the DTC acted as a depository, they didn't say a word about running out of shares""*

In this case, see the section on PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION for what I believe allows them to use their own marketplace.  THIS is the bit everyone should be focused on."|0.79|85|0|85

But really, don't wait.  Why would you?  If you're going to dump your current partner once you're rich, why are you still with them now?  You're obviously not invested in the relationship, so do everyone involved a favor and end it now.

Besides, waiting till after your spaceship comes in to break up just gives them a better chance at taking some of it for themselves.  The sooner you've ended it, the more chance you have to keep everything for yourself.

The only time it makes sense is if you are in a position where you cannot be without someone else in a relationship, no matter who they are. In that case, you probably have issues going on that outrageous amounts of money aren't going to resolve anyways.

*Belk sues former CEO Patel for ‘deceptive practices,’ poaching senior employees*

*Belk department store this week sued its former CEO Nir Patel, another former executive and GameStop Corp. accusing them of stealing its employees and payroll information, according to North Carolina federal court documents. Patel stepped down in May as CEO less than a year after taking the helm of the Charlotte-based retail chain. That same month, he was appointed chief operating officer for video game store chain GameStop Corp. Since then, Patel has solicited some of Belk’s senior employees to resign and come to work for GameStop, despite the company’s 12-month agreement with Patel that restricts soliciting, recruiting or hiring Belk’s employees, the lawsuit states.*

*GameStop executives, including its CEO Matt Furlong, also encouraged “unfair and deceptive trade practices,” the lawsuit states, by aiding Patel’s recruitment of high-ranking Belk employees. Tim May resigned as Belk’s senior vice president of supply chain this month after he was “poached” in June by Patel and GameStop officials, including Furlong, according to the lawsuit. May allegedly stole compensation information for hundreds of Belk employees. Belk says May sent spreadsheets with confidential information to his personal emails that included Belk employees’ annual pay, bonuses and other benefit information. “May undoubtedly intends to use that information to assist Patel and GameStop in their continuing unlawful campaign to raid Belk’s senior ranks,” the court documents state. Along with a request for a jury trial, Belk asked the court to order Patel, GameStop and May to cease from sharing confidential employment information and recruiting its employees. The company also requested the court to bar GameStop from employing May and compensating for damages. Belk is being represented by Jacob Wharton and Patrick Spaugh of Womble Bond Dickinson. Law360 first reported about the lawsuit. Belk officials referred to owner Sycamore Partners counsel, who declined comment Wednesday. Efforts to reach GameStop officials were unsuccessful Wednesday. Attorneys for the defendants were not listed in the lawsuit.*

Apparently their is another story about this on [law360.com](https://law360.com) however I was unable to locate it after a quick search."|0.9|53|0|53

Ask yourself...

What percentage of LEGITIMATE members of this sub would even think to go to the GameStop employee sub to cause problems?

If you were a SHF wouldn't want to cause division between investors and employees on the same day that GameStop announces it plans to make some of it's employees investors?

MODS - Why not get a jump on this campaign by coordinating with the MODS of the employee sub as well as the other GME investors subs? Set a honeytrap on each of the subs to attract the bots and shills and, if the user can't show proof that they actually hold GME and are also employed by GameStop, simply ban them from all GME investor subs.

I'd go as far as to say that the MODS on the employee sub should be equally concerned about the reverse that occurs with bots and shills from their sub stirring up division on the GME investor subs.

Sounds like a great way to cull the herd.

HI Everone and Mr Ryan Cohen, I am posting this with the image of my proof of 3000 shares.  I originally posted on gmeorphans but I was not able to update my post there as I did not have a draft of the original post.  Without the draft, you cannot access the images and video screen.  I tried all kinds of stuff, then one of the mods suggested I post on this sub. My first try didn’t have enough text so I’m hoping this will meet the requirements of 250 characters.  I don’t think I have enough points for superstonk yet, it’s tough trying to get points, hopefully one day it will happen.  I hope everyone drs’s their shares. Have patience, one day things will happen.  I read the superstonk everyday.  Thanks to No Vacation mod for helping with my post."|0.96|227|0|227

Alexis Ohanian is long GME (there's a Bloomberg article I can't find where he mentions this, and also [this tweet](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1354174741410508800?s=20&amp;t=Rc6lc0ioGxD7bFlvc_nPQQ))

[GME could merge with 3BY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAoNSH69lkI&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&amp;#x200B;

hmmmm,

Im thinking it would make a lot of sense to use 3BYs stores as GMERICA / AMERICANA storefronts where if you buy a verified physical item via NFT you can have it delivered to a GMERICANA location to enjoy or pickup. Also to deliver sold Americana physical items.

&amp;#x200B;

Im thinking GME NFT is the marketplace.

Americana is the physical to digital link (via the americana chip) + 3D scanning and certificating originality of item ([check out this thread](https://twitter.com/TheGingerLedger/status/1560431240670392320?s=20&amp;t=qG56NMGC4hNPNgnf0hRoXQ))

GMERICA are the storefronts on 3BY locations.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this makes a lot of sense.

No proof of anything heading this way, but I think it would be awesome.

Also, Americana is a project started by [Jake Frey](http://freylabs.com)

t3_wvbui2|1661219495|GME|What if we never sell any GME, but instead borrow against it?|"Think about it, if you don’t sell any shares but instead use them as collateral for a loan (post squeeze). 
The risk of this is to default on the interest payment and have your shares liquidated. Also if GME drops in value suddenly you could be liquidated too right?

Could this actually be a good idea? Or would it be too risky?

Edit: 
What if GameStop starts it’s own stock exchange and the stock is not so easily manipulated anymore. If GameStop makes it possible to borrow against the stock with them, would that be a good idea? Would something like that be possible for GameStop to do?

Edit 2: 
GameStop would earn interest for providing the shareholders with money and we wouldn’t have to sell any GME to do so. Win win win?

Edit 3: 
If we use GME as collateral to borrow some money to live, we don’t have to sell, hedgies can’t close their position and price should stay high. Only works if GameStop moves to their own exchange though. 

Also we need to be sure that the one we are borrowing from does not have to sell our shares to be able to provide us the loan.

Last edit: 
This idea only makes sense if you don’t want to sell GME but need money to buy a house or something, and can eventually pay off the loan with an income (basically like a mortgage with GME as collateral). Its wildly complicated for GameStop too."|0.71|56|0|56

t3_wvafpz|1661215603|GME|Bold prediction: something big happens before earnings call.|To start, I think we can all agree that the random selling of the other stock is a little strange. While I don’t really care because it’s not GME, it’s still strange. Also the other stocks  stocks response after also seemed interesting. But, the one thing that is extremely bullish is RCs silence. What if, RC sold his stock and is being silent because something is coming. GME acquiring buy buy buy baby could easily be bullish on both fronts. Do you remember when the other stock  was running and gme wasn’t moving until that random spike and halt up? Yea exactly.  The other stock applies pressure which helps gme. But anyways, if gme acquire buy buy baby it would cause both the othee stock and gme to rip potentially leading to the you know where .

""All submissions should refer to File Number SR-OCC-2022-803 and should be submitted on or before August 16, 2022.""

If you've been following other stocks lately, you'll know that August 16th is not only the last day you could have filed a submission to amend this bill, it's also the day before the other new favorite stock reached its peak, which happened to trigger RegSho. Given that some of the short positions will have to close at the beginning of September for this reason, and that it will coincide with the date the pension funds will become an all you can eat buffet to pay for irresponsible shorting, it almost feels like someone was trying to push for stocks to squeeze and blame Ryan Cohen for the whole thing. So why did he sell? Definitely he must have guessed that something was fishy and it was best to take an exit before it gets out of control.

t3_wv618a|1661204392|GME|Expect brokers to make DRS'ing easier as we get closer|"# Preface

The way I understand it, all brokers have is a ""Trust me bro I have shares allocated to you"" from the DTCC.

**My brain is a smoother than a mango when it comes to this stuff**, but:

# Broker X

It seems that, let's say when a new purchase of 100 GME shares is made through 'Broker X', that broker then goes to the DTCC during settlement period, says ""hey, I have 100 new shares of GME purchased here, please adjust accordingly"", and the DTCC adjusts the shares allocated to that broker. 

Since its all electronic, Broker X believes that the DTCC, which holds all the GME shares (except for those DRS'd), has allocated those 100 shares to it, which it then allocates to its customer. Now, as part of Broker X's business model, it can lend out these 100 shares to short-sellers for a bit of extra profit, which of course it'll take advantage of, especially if there's a bunch of people wanting to short the stock.

# Dude, where's my shares?

One of the consequences of the splividend fiasco was that brokers started to realize the DTCC processed the splividend in a way which goes against GameStop's intent. Meaning instead of the DTCC *adding* the shares it was given via GameStop via ComputerShare to the already allocated shares to brokers, it instead just told the brokers to multiply their clients' holdings with a massive ""Trust me Bro, I have the shares allocated to you"". 

This signals to Broker X that there simply aren't enough shares to go around, to be allocated to *all* the brokers, and the brokers are left holding the bag on all the 100 shares they lent out. If I were Broker X, the first thing I'd then do is raise the price of share lending of that stock. Now, on the off-chance that all these deranged internet kids actually manage to DRS the float, what would I want to do as Broker X, especially that I don't want to be holding the bag on these shares? Make DRS easier for them. 

When a share is DRS'd out of a broker, it's the **DTCC's problem**, and no longer the broker's. Broker X in theory has 100 shares of GME allocated to it. Broker X has an 'IOU' of sorts from the DTCC for those 100 shares, and when a DRS transfer is processed, it signals to the DTCC to remove that allocated share from the broker and 'send' it to ComputerShare. In the event that the entire float is DRS'd, the broker is no longer on the hook for any shares as far as its customer is concerned - the customer DRS'd all 100 shares, **it's the DTCC's problem now.**

# It's your problem now.

The idea that it takes a while for some brokers to DRS the shares because they need to *find* the shares is, IMHO, wrong. I think the splividend, either by design or as a consequence of, showed the brokers they're equally fucked in the event everything is DRS'd, and I think they'll continue to make it easier for people to DRS, lend out fewer shares, and make share lending more expensive. 

Don't take anything I say seriously, once again, I'm a rambling smoothape.

TL,DR; **DRS. Everything.**"|0.83|31|0|31
