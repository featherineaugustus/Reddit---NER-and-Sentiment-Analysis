t3_xcrjc7|1663025155|Wallstreetbetsnew|$RAM - Lowest NAV Spac Float With Options Ever at 2.2m - Unique Squeeze Play With 4% Capped Downside &amp; MASSIVE UpsideüöÄ|"What‚Äôs up y‚Äôall. You may remember me from being one of if not the first to write about $SST ($15 - 37) and more recently $FAZE ($11 - $25) before the run-ups and I‚Äôm coming back to you with another asymmetric, still yet to run spac play. This one is much less riskier than the two, while providing the same if not MORE upside and therefore is my favorite yet.

$RAM is a SPAC that just recently had its extension vote and had a large number of redemptions that brought the public float down to just 2,296,058 shares. This stock also has options which makes it one of the lowest floats with options on the market and the lowest float with options and NAV protection currently. Yes even lower than the other low float NAV spacs $THCA (2.7m) and $ESSC (3.3m) which both went to $14 and $26 off gamma squeezes respectively.

$RAM is currently sitting at $10.64 with a NAV floor of $10.21 which implies a max downside of \~4% from these levels. (Arbitrage algorithms will buy the stock if it falls below the price because it can be redeemed for the $10.21 price at merger- if you take a look at the stock history you will see this kind of price action (NAV has been increasing incrementally and we are closer the merger which explains the price increase).

So the downside here is 4%. What about the upside?

Let‚Äôs put the ridiculous and unprecedented mechanics at play here when it comes to gamma into perspective.

With a float of only 2,296,058 it would take 22,961 contracts to cover the ENTIRE float. As of now, we currently have 2,655 in OI in contracts which are currently trading for intrinsic ($0.5 each), meaning it would take a volume influx of only $1,015,300 to cover 20,306 contracts needed to account for the ENTIRE FLOAT ITM.

Remember that the $10 contracts will STAY in the money and absolutely NEED to be hedged by call sellers as the floor here is $10.2.

At the $12.5 strike we have 7,298 contracts which equate to 32% of the float.

This means we are ALREADY in gamma squeeze territory and will likely see the results of hedging towards the end of the week.

If this gets more call volume, market makers will be extremely hard pressed to find shares especially in the likely event that retail buys and holds shares driving the price up alongside the increase in call volume as this catches more eyes.

The stock has barely made any waves on social media yet outside of people who follow spacs closely making it a select few aware of the float dynamics that create the unique opportunity, yet it already has a pretty built chain for its float size. Now just try to imagine if this got even a piece of volume of some of these other squeeze plays being touted here.

If this can get the (little) volume needed to claim the float or even most of it to make gamma squeeze history, I don‚Äôt know, but with a risk of 4% which is about the downside you get in a single candle 5-min candle on $BBBY and options that have exceptionally low IV I am willing to die on this hill.

This will probably be my last update on this until we see some more volume because until then the thesis will not have changed. Hopefully see you all again soon.

Disclosure: I own shares and September and October calls.

# Portfolio Basket Swap Closures

&amp;#x200B;

[The BBBY swap report entries with IDs.  Basically two big swaps: 26JUN2019 and 24FEB2020](https://preview.redd.it/kkgfl6ahmgm91.jpg?width=2344&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3de3592894e92bdd169e53cd16937b34be563549)

In looking at the execution timestamps, there are only two initial executions and then ongoing amendments and terminations to that

notional value is the total value of a position in a financial security.  principal is changing on only two original executions: it's like two loan balances changing over time with amendments and/or terminations

[02AUG2022 and 09AUG2022 are when these were closed.](https://preview.redd.it/x31z50y3ngm91.png?width=1207&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bbe621fe539ed8aa8cbf532eb62b7dff205e3e2)

FTDs for this would have been generated on the 2nd and 9th of august. T+35 is September 6th (2 million) and September 13th (2 million) for a little under 4 million shares in total.  That's $16,520,600 worth of buying at the current share price on September 6th, and $17,192,346 worth of buying at the current share price on September 13th.

A rough ballpark: it's 3,920,110 shares. if the price goes back to $10 on average, they'll have to buy $39.2 Million worth. if the price goes back to $20 on average, they'll have to buy $78.4 Million worth.  Note that the required dollar amount to support this .  Yet, these are rookie numbers.  Here's why:

# Mathematical Interpolation to obtain new FTDs

&amp;#x200B;

[Actual $BBBY FTDs not in swaps - Interpolated as a function of price increase and volume.  5 days of 11.7 Million daily FTDs on average for the week of 15-19 August.  That's 60 Million shares, yet other estimates show that, if we shift accurately based on share volume, 100 Million shares may have failed during that week.](https://preview.redd.it/p7ffq3wqwgm91.png?width=1542&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bca461eaaa165113cff0eb749e497fc9b233587c)

&amp;#x200B;

That's 60 to 100 Million in FTDs (number of shares) from 13-19th August, which is the bulk of the price increase.

# It doesn't matter how we spin this: based on T-35 settlement of all of these FTDs, from today to September 23rd, 64 Million to 104 Million of shares of $BBBY have to be bought back to settle the aforementioned FTDs

# üíµüíµüíµüíµüí≤‚úÖAt $10.00 per share for $BBBY, that's $1.04 Billion dollars worth of required buys, out of nowhere.  If the price goes back up to $30 per share, that's $3.04 Billion dollars worth of required buys.  That's a 479% of the market cap based on FTD-settlement-buying alone... not even including natural buying, not to mention call options gamma effect ‚úÖüí≤üíµüíµüíµüíµ

&amp;#x200B;

# As if that wasn't already good enough, here are more reasons why, heretofore, more hedge funds will 100% be 'Melvin'd' this month:

* OK,  so then let's add a macro market rebound on top of that.  macro bullishness and risk-on being back. more 'endgame' level of market froth
* Ok, so then let's add strong $GME earnings \[approaching profitability and substantially overtaking Amazon in rate of sales growth\] on top of that, which will serve as an underlying leader that adds intense buying pressure and has a meme-basket correlation and algorithm correlation (not to mention margin account and hedge fund liabilities correlation) to stocks like $BBBY
* Ok, so then let's add volkswagen 2008 entering the chat.  issuing their own dividend at the end of the month for Porsche IPO, literally recreating volkswagen of 2008.  note that VWAGY 'mini squoze' on 15MAR2021, same day as GameStop.  this can be considered a meme stock.
* Ok, so then let's add the P/C ratio on the options chain which is out of wack right now:  something HUGE is about to happen
* Ok, so then let's add $APE to the fucking mix
* Ok, so then let's add $AMC to the fucking mix
* Ok, so then let's add the fact that the chinese collateral ticker scam is now dead in the water \[no more fake equity on the books to offset short liabilities (shares sold not yet purchased)\]
* Ok, I'm not done
* Ok, so then let's add $BBBY positive developments: New CEO.  New CFO.  Turnaround plans.  Possible acquisition plans.  Defense of fraudulent lawsuit.  $1.2 Billion cash on hand.  $1 Billion + in sales.  2,800.00% increase in fair price to sales ratio just to make P/S equal with its peers
* Ok, so then let's add the fact that it only takes $75 Million at current prices to fully lock the $BBBY float via DRS via computershare.com? what's not to like?  Proof of naked shorting via locking the $BBBY float could happen in a day...
* Ok, so then let's add September OPEX to the mix
* Ok, so then let's add OPTIONS.  gamma ramps for all of these.  adding exponential pressure as if all of those weren't already enough
* **Ok, so then let's add actual buying to cover shorts by hedge funds being margin liquidated.  We haven't even seen this yet, not even in 2021.  Shorts never closed, so most of you have no idea what an actual buy-ins looks like  Just wait for it - you've never seen anything like it.**
* It's game over here for shorts.  check mate.  I am hereby predicting that reports of several hedge funds being 'Melvin'd' will come out in Sept/Oct.

# TLDR:

On FTD close outs alone from August, $1 Billion to $3 Billion worth of $**BBBY** shares will be bought back, over the next two weeks, assuming a $10 to $30 baseline share price range in that time.  At $30 per share average, the FTD settlement buying of $BBBY would inject **479.00%** *of additional market cap thereafter* based on these FTD close outs alone from August.  This buying is legally required by RegSHO.  If we factor in all of the aforementioned other developments, such as options gamma, positive corporate developments, strength in GameStop earnings elevating meme stocks, then we can best-guess that someone else is getting 'Melvin'd' this month.  If we, then, add in possible buy-ins from short covering... then we'll get an actual price runup here in $**BBBY** unlike anything we have ever seen."|0.8|113|0|113

Likely hit a bottom Friday (or certainly close enough to jump in and avoid chasing it on a sharp upswing reversal... considering IHS is now right at book value. There has also been a increase in Institutional buyers adding to their positions the past couple of weeks.

Insider Ownership is 32%
Institutional ownership is 55%
Current Ave DV is less than 200,000
**A move to even a remotely typical Average Daily Volume for a $2B company ($500K+), should quickly return Shares to IPO Price $18+ 

There are almost too many positive angles to discuss- but here is an attempt at a full look at the high points.


**Background**
$IHS is the Fastest Growing Cell Tower company. IHS is currently priced at $6.50. It has 7 analyst ratings (all Buys) and an average price target of $18 (most recent price target, issued 2 weeks ago, was Cowen's PT increase to $27).

Current P/S ratio is 1.2  (Price/Book ratio is also 1.2).  Market cap is $2B (an accurate current MC is a minimum of $6-$8B). Last Twelve Months revenue is just under $2Billion &amp; LTM EBITD is right at $1Billion.

IHS is the leading International wireless communications provider in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.

Overall, IHS has 39,000 towers in its property portfolio, across 11 countries (Brazil... south America's largest Country &amp; Nigeria... Africa's largest country, account for the majority of its towers).


**Insanely Undervalued (the reason IHS is highly likely to make quick moves to Analyst 3x and 4x Price Targets)**

Int'l Cell Tower Leaders:
$AMT :  $122B ...195K Towers
$CCI :   $75B ...40K Towers
$SBAC : $36B ...33K Towers

$IHS :   $2B ...39K Towers

IHS went public the end of 2021. The combination being unknown due to operations outside the US, along with the sell off the first half of the year, lead to IHS drifting down about 50% from the $18 IPO area. Then as the market rebounded the past couple of months, a HF/s has been able to manipulate price down even more - due to extremely low trading volume (150,000 average daily volume). 

IHS has an experienced, solid management Team and Board of Director.  2 notable US Board members are... 1) Ursula Barns (Former CEO of Xerox, and  Board member Exxon and Uber. Also- President Obama appointed Burns to lead the White House national program on Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) from 2009 - 2016 and she served as Chair of the President‚Äôs Export Council from 2015 - 2016.... and 2) Jeb Bush. (these members also indicate IHS is likely also interested in US assets).

... IHS is under the radar, but is starting to create a buzz.  A relatively small increase in Average Daily Volume- with send the stock moving quickly to Analysts Price Targets.


**1 Good Reason to get in now ..&amp; hold even after a run to current Price Targets**

Aside from the Huge Future upside as its Market Cap moves to catch up with other Tower Co's MC.... is the chance to lock in the low entry point, to capitalize on the Divided that will eventually come. 

 IHS is still in its initial growth stage &amp; is therefore using earning to reinvent and acquire Additional Tower assets- (A very smart strategy...for example, IHS is now the leading Power in South Africa following its recent Acquisition of MTN which added 5,700 Towers to its total &amp; 12,000 sites it will Provide PAAS (Power as a Service). The Deal cost $400M (which makes q2 GAAP earnings look artificially low) but the real effect, in the first year alone it provides revenue of $200M and EBITDA of $80M. 

But as revenues start to compound in the next couple if years- Due to Tower Co's tax structure, it will begin to pay a dividend. And if Using IHS as a long term hold strategy-  the eventual dividend could very likely be over 50% per share (based on current cost basis)

So I was recently looking at the Garbage, dumpster fire which is HEXO because TILRAY has an interest in their brands and it got me thinking; hexo has lost a huge portion of its value; is burning money left and right and is at risk of being de-listed... So maybe there is an opportunity to make money somehow in this shit show.

Currently you can buy 100 shares of hexo for roughly $20-$21

And thats exactly what I have been doing, buying blocks of 100 shares and then selling a call option against them expiring as far out as possible for as much premium as possible.. which gets you about .10 per share... making your cost average .10-.11 but ties your shares up until 2024...

The way I look at what could happen is very simple..

HEXO gets bought out and acquired by TLRY.. maybe at .15-.20 cents per share... While your cost average is .11 a share... and you will make a nice profit.

Or HEXO has to do a reverse split 10:1 to keep their price above $1.00 for 10 consecutive days to dodge being delisted.. which will make the call options you are selling against your shares basically worthless because they will be so far out of the money no one will want them and you can probably scoop them back up for half the price.

Or The USA legalizes marijuana during the next year and HEXO will go on a bull run way back past your strike price which will put you getting .50 cents a share when your cost average is .11 (this would be the best outcome)

Or HEXO goes bankrupt and such as your position (but I think this is far more unlikely since TLRY has a interest in HEXO and would scoop them up way prior to this point."|0.82|7|0|7
t3_x2fxeo|1661958282|Wallstreetbetsnew|$BBBY üíô The silver lining: this is the best news ever.|"# This morning's news is the best news we have received in a long time

First things first: Bankruptcy is OFFICIALLY off the table.  why do we say this? Because cash flow is extremely positive, &gt; $1 billion sales?  Wow, and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's board has exhibited confidence: they understand the value of Buy Buy Baby and they're choosing *to keep it*. This to me shows a level of selfishness that I am happy to see. It shows that they are not giving away anything, and the leadership is *confident that they will thrive in the future.*

They also now have $ .50 Billion dollars in an instant liquidity War Chest. Thanks to that Buy Buy Baby collateral. And further, \[and what is similar to the AMC Capital generation prior to AMC's June 2021 squeeze\], Bed Bath and Beyond, which may have already completed the sale of 12 million shares this morning, looks like it may have generated around $100 - $200 million more dollars \[cash on the books\].

That makes $BBBY's current liquidity = \~ $1.2 Billion. This implies 10 years of guaranteed survivability, and post-pandemic continuation of its sales increases.  Bed Bath and Beyond, based on their numbers, could even reach profitability upon the cutting of inefficient store locations. Their cash position is now better than all retailers of its class.

This further strengthens the balance sheet and puts Bed Bath and Beyond in a position to not only thrive during this holiday season, in which it is already purchased the inventory for (22 ships bringing Halloween and Christmas items), but to thrive *in perpetuity as a business with an indefinite expiration date.  I repeat, with this information: no terminal date as a business.*

Since bankruptcy is never going to happen here, short-sellers are screwed.  This 'bankruptcy hope' of theirs was their only investment thesis.

That short thesis today is proven to be off the table.

Yes, the company is now trading at 4.4 billion total.

The will make over 6 billion in 2022 and 3+ billion 2023!

They have 120 million shares, so if they gave out 30 dollars as above dividends that is nearly 3.6 billion!

In other words the company is trading at below what they make!

The company has close to 6 billion in cash! It has a little over 2 billion in debt! 

They had sales growth of 45% in 2nd quarter of 2022 and made 1.34 billion! With a B! profit! 

It has come down with other vessel shippers because dry balk shipping rates have come down to 2020 levels.. However they are making over 6 billion in 2022, paid 3.6 billion to diamond hodlers‚Ä¶ Will make 3-4 billion in 2023 and authorized 30% of profits in the form of dividends! 

$15 dollars roughly!

So if we are going to diamond hand something, might as well collect tendies while we wait!

&amp;#x200B;

""Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond last week was finalizing a **$370 million** loan deal with investment firm Sixth Street. The company said in mid-August it was working with financial advisors and lenders on **strengthening its balance sheet**.""

""Investors also hope the retailer will disclose any progress it has made finding an acquirer for its BuyBuy Baby chain. The U.S. baby-gear seller, with more than 130 stores, could command anywhere between **$630 million to $910 million**, Wedbush analysts estimate.""

""Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond had said in late June there was **interest in the BuyBuy Baby chain from potential acquirers**, and Ryan Cohen encouraged the retailer to seek out options for the chain earlier this year, according to a securities filing.""

""At Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, inventories rose 12.5% during the quarter ending May 28. Between June 3 to Aug 22, **at least 22 ships from Asia carrying 40 large containers of Halloween and Christmas merchandise arrived at U.S. ports destined for Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond stores** and distribution centers, data from sea-freight refund consultancy Ocean Audit shows.""

# TLDR:

The price today obtained $15.51 in pre-market, and $15.15 during the day, indicating a new uptrend and return of outsized buy volume.  Technicals for $**BBBY** show a bullish end-of-day breakout above the day's trendline of resistance, combined with a rebound off the 50SMA and primed/recharged RSI on the chart with 30 minute periods.  Reuters revealed that there is interest in *Buy Buy Baby* being acquired. Wedbush estimates that *Buy Buy Baby* could fetch up to $910 Million in instant cash, which alone doubles the company's market cap overnight.

The Net Asset Value (NAV) calculation of the company in this case shows that it should be 300% of its current price; marking a **$30.00 per share** minimum baseline price.  The Liquidation Value calculation is **$60.00 per share**, which includes 40mm clients or 12% of US population (replacement value per client is $100 per client and adding back NOL carry forwards and cutting inventory in half).  Another independent source (NYU Stearn) projects a 0.88 P/S ratio for $**BBBY**, which implies **$94.00 per share**.  Data also shows that 22 large ships containing 40 giant containers of Halloween and Christmas merchandise is coming to stores.  Further, $**BBBY**'s CEO provides a big announcement on Wednesday (premarket tomorrow)."|0.74|14|0|14

Small float, more then 50% short interest, WEBR ran and other shit, but this not yet major pop...slow and steady mover she is. have yet to see multi million day volume yet. still under radar. 
pulled back to 21ema on Daily few days back, recovered nicely and now back on a new uptrend channel...check out the charts for yourselves, do your dd. Earnings 09/07, in 2 weeks time. they have already lowered guidance and that has been priced in with their previous dip and now it's recovered and consolidated with half the float short. 

Holding 7.5 and 10c for 09/16. Let's fuck!

That number is of course growing, but that means there are 12 different leaders calling shots for all different types of trades for you to look at and do your own DD on to choose what trades you want to follow.This group is great for unexperienced/lesser experienced traders to learn a ton about trading and ask questions as well as experienced traders to discuss and share ideas about trades.

There are call outs all throughout the day and reminders/alerts when certain stocks that have been called out start taking off. This really comes in handy if you work and cannot watch your stocks all day. The group started on reddit some time ago and has grown and moved to discord recently. It is $20 a month subscription but mods are talking about how to give back to the members through various ways. The group is also full of after hour laughs and there are many discussion channels to talk about stocks and other subjects. The laughs and enjoyment from the chats alone are worth the $20 a month not including all the extra money you will make if you follow their advice. They are talking about increasing the price soon so I would advise to get in while it is still only $20. You can always choose to just not resubscribe next month if you don't like it. Here is the link to join.

Its batteries provide flexibility to grid operators and energy assurance for commercial and industrial customers. Its technology addresses energy delivery, duration, and cycle-life in a single battery platform that compares favourably to lithium-ion batteries. The company was founded in 2011 and is headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon.

ESS Tech reported their Q2 for the year (ending 30 June) on 11 August and for the first time since being founded they reported a revenue - amounting to $680,000 and a landmark moment for the company. Their share value increased by more than 18% during subsequent daily trading.

Investors should still note the net loss of ($15.6m), significantly higher than their revenue - representing a net margin loss of 2,294%. Net losses in recent quarters have been as high as ($180m). Investors could be betting that the net margin loss will improve ahead of a landmark moment for renewable energy in the US.

If signed into law, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) would allocate $369bn to households and businesses to solely invest in renewable energy sources ‚Äì a historic amount that scientists estimate will lead to carbon reductions of 40% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels - as well as positively impacting climate-related equity investments.

The first thing worth checking when a company is seeing consistent net losses is how strained its current assets to current liabilities are becoming.

In the short term, the current assets and current liabilities can measure a company's ability to pay short-term debt or obligations due within one year. Stem's short-term liquidity percentage in Q2 was 6.83% (current liabilities/current assets) - demonstrating significant control over short-term liabilities. This significantly improved compared to last year's quarter, which was 8.97%

Current assets and current liabilities stand at $199.4m and $13.6m, respectively.

Total cash for the company is up significantly from recent times, seeing $8.02m as of 30 September 2021 increase to $239m by the end of 2021. Total cash has since fallen to $112.7m for Q2 - however, softened by liquidity.

Total assets were down over the last six months to $216.1m (from $250.2m) - however, total liabilities have also decreased significantly to $29.3m (from $40m).

Long-term liquidity percentage improved in the last six months from 16% to 13.6%.

2021 was also a landmark year for ESS Tech to bolster its balance sheet and get on top of previously elevated liabilities seen in the previous two years. Total assets from FY20 to FY21 increased from $9.02m to $250m (with 95.6% consisting of total cash) - while total liabilities remained fairly flat at $45m.

Below is only the first part of the article

**Liquidia Corp (LQDA)**

**Price: $5.90**

**Shares Outstanding: 64M**

**Market Cap: $320M**

**Cash: $70M (Only used 70% of cash balance ‚Äì not profitable)**

**LT Debt: $24M**

**EV: $274M**

The complicated nature of this special situation resulted in this analysis being longer than my normal posts. Therefore I wanted to include a quick summary of the analysis. While this situation is inherently complicated, the thesis itself is fairly straight forward. Liquidia is currently in a Hatch-Waxman litigation after their competitor, United Therapeutics, filed a lawsuit against them in 2020, claiming that Liquidia was infringing on three of their patents. In 2021, Liquidia received tentative FDA approval for their product Yutrepia, pending the outcome of the patent dispute. Roughly two years later, we are now close to the dispute being resolved, with the decision expected to be handed down between August and the end of October. While it‚Äôs difficult to probability weigh the outcome, I do believe Liquidia will receive a favorable court ruling and will therefore be able to launch Yutrepia in 4Q2022.

Both Liquidia and United are focused on pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). United pretty much has a monopoly on PAH (group 1) patients &amp; PH-ILD (group 3) patients, and Liquidia is now looking to enter this market with their new product Yutrepia. United‚Äôs product, Tyvaso, did 607M in revenue in 2021, and looks to do roughly 800M this year.

That‚Äôs revenue from group 1 and group 3 combined. The TAM for group 1 and 3 combined, is roughly 5.3B ‚Äì a massive market. Liquidia also has the superior product, and so they could possibly take significant market share from United. Given Liquidia‚Äôs 320M market cap, and them possibly entering a 5.3B market with the superior product, a favorable decision by the district court could result in a significant rerating of the company. Overall, I believe this situation offers a very attractive risk/reward profile at the current price.

**Brief Business Overview**

Liquidia Corp is a biopharmaceutical company focused on pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH is a rare, chronic, progressive disease caused by hardening and narrowing of the pulmonary arteries that can lead to right heart failure and eventually death, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of approximately 30,000 patients. The company‚Äôs proprietary PRINT engineering technology allows them to engineer and manufacture highly uniform drug particles with precise control over the size, three-dimensional geometric shape and chemical composition of the particles. As a result, the company has been able to develop their main drug candidate Yutrepia (treprostinil) inhalation powder, which is an inhaled dry powder formulation of treprostinil delivered through a proven, convenient, palm-sized device.

The company also has a commercially approved product named Treprostinil Injection. The Liquidia PAH subsidiary (formerly RareGen) commercializes generic Treprostinil Injection in a partnership with Sandoz. Treprostinil Injection is most likely nothing more than a $15-25M revenue product at 80% gross margin. In other words, it might provide some flexibility in terms of near term capital needs, but nothing more.

The PAH market currently has one dominant player, Liquidia‚Äôs only competitor - United Therapeutics (UTHR). UTHR sells Tyvaso, a nebulized form of treprostinil along with a few other versions of the same drug which are administered via infusion. Tyvaso did 607M in revenue in 2021 and looks to be doing 800M in 2022. That‚Äôs for group 1 and group 3 patients combined. As mentioned above, Liquidia's drug, Yutrepia, is an inhaled version of treprostinil targeting Tyvaso's current market. An inhaled version of treprostinil is better than a nebulized version - nebulized treprostinil requires a clunky device with 10-13 parts while inhaled treprostinil only requires an inhaler. That‚Äôs why UTHR is coming out with their own inhaled product, Tyvaso DPI, through a partnership with MannKind Corporation.

**Timeline And Development of The Lawsuit**

On June 5th, 2020, Liquidia‚Äôs only competitor ‚Äì United Therapeutics Corporation ‚Äì filed a lawsuit against Liquidia for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,604,901 (the '901 patent) and 9,593,066 (the '066 patent) relating to United Therapeutics' product Tyvaso (treprostinil) Inhalation Solution. The lawsuit came as a result of Liquidia filing their NDA for the approval of LIQ861 ‚Äì now known as Yutrepia. Upon initiation of the lawsuit, the FDA triggered a statutory regulatory stay on the final approval of Yutrepia until October 27, 2022, or earlier resolution or settlement of the ongoing litigation.

On July 24th, 2020, UTHR filed an amended complaint asserting infringement of U.S. Patent No. 10,716,793 (‚Äò793) in addition to the already asserted infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. ‚Äô901 and ‚Äô066. However, the ‚Äò793 patent was not subject to the FDA‚Äôs regulatory stay because it was not listed in the Orange Book for Tyvaso when Liquidia submitted the NDA for Yutrepia.

In October, 2020, LQDA provided an update on the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board Decision on Inter Partes Review (IPR) of two of United‚Äôs Tyvaso patents. The update explained how PTAB had instituted IPR on patent ‚Äò901, but denied institution on patent ‚Äò066. This update meant that the 30 month stay would still be in effect, and that LQDA would have to argue invalidity and non-infringement in the district court regarding patent ‚Äò066.

I wanted to briefly explain the difference between the district court, where the trial was held, and the PTAB, as they do two different things. The PTAB IPR is filed by LQDA to review patentability of claims in the patent, while cases filed by UTHR go to the district court to argue LQDA infringes (though LQDA can either argue invalidity or non-infringement as defense). For the PTAB to review a patent, one or more claims have to be unpatentable.

Fast forward to August 2021, the PTAB instituted an IPR proceeding against the ‚Äò793 patent. A couple of months later, in October 2021, the PTAB ruled in Liquidia‚Äôs favor in the IPR proceeding against the ‚Äò901 patent. In its ruling, the PTAB found that seven of the nine claims were unpatentable. Only the narrower dependent claims 6 and 7 remain, both of which require actual storage at ambient temperature of treprostinil sodium.

On November 5, 2021, the FDA issued a tentative approval for Yutrepia (treprostinil) inhalation powder, which is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to improve exercise ability in adult patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms. What this means is that if the PTAB and/or the district court rules in Liquidia‚Äôs favor, the approval will no longer be tentative, and they can launch Yutrepia right away.

December 2021: The Court grants LQDA leave to file a motion for summary judgment of invalidity of the ‚Äò066 and ‚Äò901 patents due to collateral estoppel. Trial in the Hatch-Waxman litigation is scheduled for March 28-30, 2022. Later that month, on December 29th, UTHR filed a stipulation of partial judgment with respect to the ‚Äò901 patent. Under the stipulation of partial judgment, UTHR agreed to the entry of judgment of Liquidia‚Äôs non-infringement of the ‚Äô901 patent based on the Court‚Äôs construction of certain terms in the patent. With this stipulation of partial judgment, only the ‚Äò066 patent would serve as a basis for the on-going regulatory stay for final approval of Yutrepia (treprostinil) inhalation powder by the FDA.

That brings us to July 22nd, 2022, the PTAB rules in Liquidia‚Äôs favor in IPR proceeding against patent ‚Äò793. In its ruling, the PTAB found that, based on the preponderance of the evidence, all the claims of the ‚Äô793 patent have been shown to be unpatentable.

**Conclusion**

I think at this point, my conclusion is that while it‚Äôs hard to probability weigh the outcome of the trial, the risk/reward is favorable enough that it‚Äôs worth taking a position, for me. In the short term you get a risk reward profile of 75-80% downside with 200%+ upside. For what it‚Äôs worth, I do also think the odds of getting a favorable ruling is in Liquidia‚Äôs favor. It‚Äôs just difficult to determine how much in Liquidia‚Äôs favor the odds are. Furthermore, given that the outcome is favorable, not only do you get the possibility of 200% immediate upside, you also get a clear path to a much higher return than the 200%, over the long term. In fact, the IRR‚Äôs could get silly high."|1.0|5|0|5

It‚Äôs about time the rigged ass system put some crooks away. 


Updated onAugust 10, 2022, 5:02 PM CDT
The former head of the JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. precious-metals business and his top gold trader were convicted in Chicago on charges they manipulated markets for years, handing the US government a win in its long crackdown on bogus ‚Äúspoofing‚Äù orders.

Michael Nowak and Gregg Smith were found guilty Wednesday by a federal jury after a three-week trial and more than eight days of deliberations. Prosecutors presented evidence that included detailed trading records, chat logs and testimony by former co-workers who ‚Äúpulled back the curtain‚Äù on how Nowak and Smith moved precious-metals prices up and down for profit from 2008 to 2016. 

A salesman on the desk, Jeffrey Ruffo, was acquitted of charges he participated in the conspiracy.

The case was the biggest yet by the US Justice Department, which alleged the precious-metals business at JPMorgan was run as a criminal enterprise. Nowak, the managing director in charge of the desk, and Smith, its top trader, were convicted of fraud, spoofing, market manipulation. 

‚ÄúThey had the power to move the market, the power to manipulate the worldwide price of gold,‚Äù prosecutor Avi Perry said during closing arguments.

US District Court Judge Edmond Chang said Nowak and Smith will be sentenced next year. Each faces decades in prison, though it may be far less. Two Deutsche Bank AG traders convicted of spoofing in 2020 were each sentenced to a year in prison.

t3_wlodzx|1660214879|Wallstreetbetsnew|Yellen directs IRS not to use new funding to increase chances of audits of Americans making less than $400,000.|"(CNN)Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Wednesday directed the Internal Revenue Service not to use any of the new funding allocated in the¬†Democrats' new health care and climate bill¬†to increase the number of audits of Americans making less than $400,000 a year, according to a copy of the letter obtained exclusively by CNN.

The letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig comes amid attacks from Republicans that the $80 billion the Inflation Reduction Act would give to the IRS over the next 10 years would result in more middle-class Americans and small businesses getting audited. The Biden administration has repeatedly said the IRS would focus on increased enforcement activity on high-wealth taxpayers and large corporations and not target households who earn less than $400,000 a year.

""Specifically, I direct that any additional resources‚Äîincluding any new personnel or auditors that are hired‚Äîshall not be used to increase the share of small business or households below the $400,000 threshold that are audited relative to historical levels,"" Yellen wrote in the letter to Rettig. ""This means that, contrary to the misinformation from opponents of this legislation, small business or households earning $400,000 per year or less will not see an increase in the chances that they are audited.""

Enforcement resources, Yellen said, will instead ""focus on high-end noncompliance.""

The new IRS funding is projected to raise¬†$124 billion¬†in additional tax revenue over the next 10 years, which is a key way Democrats plan to offset the cost of their plan to lower prescription drug costs and combat climate change.

The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives still needs to approve the legislation, which¬†passed the Senate on Sunday¬†after months of painstaking negotiations. Because of their narrow 50-seat majority in the Senate, Democrats used a special, filibuster-proof process to approve the $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill without Republican votes.

Rettig, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump to lead the IRS, told lawmakers last week that low- and middle-income taxpayers would not be the focus of increased enforcement action. He said better technology and customer service would also make it less likely that compliant taxpayers would be audited.

The bill itself says the new funding is not ""intended to increase taxes on any taxpayer or small business with a taxable income below $400,000.""

But Republicans continue to fiercely oppose the new IRS funding and make claims about increased audits on middle-class Americans.

The Republican National Committee and several Republican lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, claim the new funding will create 87,000 new IRS agents. But that number is misleading. Treasury did estimate in 2021 that a nearly $80 billion investment in the IRS could allow the agency to hire 86,852 full-time employees over the course of a decade. But that figure accounts for all workers, not solely enforcement agents. Rettig also told lawmakers that the IRS would need to hire 52,000 people over the next six years just to maintain current staffing level to replace those who retire or otherwise leave.

On CNBC‚Äôs ""Mad Money Lightning Round,"" **Jim Cramer** said he doesn‚Äôt like **Upstart Holdings Inc** (NASDAQ:[UPST](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/UPST#NASDAQ)) and recommended selling the stock.

Need I say more.

Anyways, curious what everyone thoughts are. Seems like most of the bad news has been priced into the stock price now. Bad loans should start to roll off. Earnings call on 8/8. Interest rates looked to have peaked in June. At least in the short term. High short interest at 33%. Stocks has crashed to low 20's and down 94% from the highs. Now near IPO price. Seems like an interesting play right now. Weekly MACD trying to curl.

This is not financial advice."|0.4|0|0|0

I was wondering if any of you know the brokerage firm with the best rate for their securities lending program.

I‚Äôm with Schwab right now that claims 50/50 shared profits from lending.  If anyone knows a brokerage that offers more than 50% CTB, that would be amazing.

I‚Äôm also curious if it‚Äôs possible to haggle rates with brokerage firms.  I tried to find evidence of successful negotiated lending rates but could not find anything. 

Right now I own a stock that has &gt;300% CTB, but Schwab is only offering ~100% so thinking they might be lowballing me.  

Let me know what y‚Äôall think."|0.55|1|0|1

In this DD, I will try to methodically point out, why $DTC is coming closer and closer to a really big bounce and which indicator are pointing to this outcome right now. The stock market isn't a pure guessing game and I hope you take the time to listen to my theory and I appreciate any constructive feedback.

So in the past 6 month $DTC\`s share price was falling over 75%, into heavily undervalued territory. As typical with the market, it usually overreacts to the downside, before it overreacts to the upside.

&amp;#x200B;

[Since IPO we saw a falling knife until mid May, when the CEO and CFO bough 140k shares and the chart made a technical trend reversal.](https://preview.redd.it/71fg0tmm3mb91.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1601e86e0225eab3bc6a6c109c0db12b5fdb5dbe)

In my opinion we are about to witness the upside overreaction. First of all, we were able to reliably stop the downward trend and consolidated for two month now. In this time an upwards trend channel developed, which is a good indicator.

Another great thing happend, yesterday the official Short interest numbers by the Nyse were released. They showed us, that from the 15th of June to the 30th of Jun over 500k new short positions were opened. From 2.6M SI to 3.1M SI . 500k shares sold short are a huge amount, considering the avr. daily volume is only slightly above 500k, yet the share price further increased in that timeframe. From 3.80$ to 4.06$, this means shorts are desperately trying everything to keep $DTC down, because once it starts to spiral up, they will lose control and it will create a positive feedback loop, similiar to $rdbx, $bkkt or $sprt. The share price increase in this types of squeezes is related to exponential curves, at first slow, but with rapid acceleration.

Ofc, I cannot predict the intensity of the upcoming run, no-one can tell if the share price will 3x or 10x, but as long as the share price steadily increases, there is no other possibility, but a nice big squeeze.

# Cant they just keep kicking the can down the road?

That's an excellent and often misunderstood question. In theory ofc they can keep the stock price low for a long time. But this type of manipulation is quite expensive for short seller and comes with an opportunity cost. So in DTC¬¥s case it doesn't make sense, because the costs to manipulate are higher than the expected gains. The explanation therefor is a little complicated, but I will do my best to clarify one of the biggest misconceptions in retail.

If you have stocks, that already squeezed, like $GME $AMC, $RDBX for example, those stocks are highly overvalued in regard to their fundamental fair valuation. Because short sellers expect the stock price to reach the (lower) fair valuation in the future, they keep manipulating the stock for a while until their respective stock reaches the lower share price. For example in case of $rdbx, they wait for the $CSSE merger, which puts the $rdbx shares in the penny range, for that matter they just keep doubling down, until their desired event happend.

Or if you look at $GME/$AMC, which are heavily manipulated from the first big squeezes onward. Shortseller expect the hype to slowly die down and bet on every subsequent squeeze to get lower and lower, therefor they close their short positions on each dip of those meme stocks and reopen their short positions whenever they are going to make another spike.

Ofc there are many other scenarios in which it might be worth for shorts to keep a stock down in the long term, but as long as they dont close their positions they bleed money and dont cash in profits (in case the specific stock is below their shorting price)

In the case of $DTC we had no squeeze yet and shorts have massive unrealized gains at the moment, since their average short position was opened in the 7$ price range. However they did miss calculated $DTC\`s business model, by expecting $DTC to go bankrupt. Unfortunately for them the opposite happend and $DTC beat their earnings Call the past two times and Q2 went so well, that even the CEO and CFO bought over half a million dollar in shares end of May.

Now the best thing for shorts would be to slowly cover their positions and take nice profits home. But humans are greedy, the short seller are still hoping for some improbably event, that could tank $DTC and save their asses. Also, because of the ultra low volume they need over 5.44 Day to Cover all their short positions, so they keep shorting the stock against all odds.

This is great for us, as the same thing happened with $SPRT a few weeks before it took off, increasing short interest, together with increasing share price is the perfect recipe for a huge squeeze.

Mathematically there is no way for short seller to take a lot of profits, by closing out short positions, without shooting $DTC\`s share price into the sky. Once $DTC issues their next earnings call and appears on the radar of Wallstreet, heavy volume will kick in and the price is going to take off, forcing remaining short seller to buy back their shares or risk losing all their profits. Which either way will be good for us.

One last thing, unfortunately Ortex and Fintel both rely on the Data broker Capital IQ, who has calculated the wrong free float for $DTC, they come up with 14.7M shares, because they treat Class B shares same as Class A shares, this however is a big mistake. Therefore I recommend using S3 analystics or Bloomberg Terminal, who report the real SI % which lies at 35% To be sure I went through all the 13F ownership filings by myself and the real free float is 7.45M shares.

&amp;#x200B;

[Since May we made a stable upwards trend channel, the Current low point offers a great ](https://preview.redd.it/lfbu720p3mb91.png?width=1055&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a066e63bfb3b5099f5169719673e2bd0b54e5b2a)

In the current Trend channel every dip offers a great entry point until August earnings, when the bigger price action is to be expected.The management affirmed their 2022 guidance in May and expect a positive free cash flow:

***Guidance for Full Fiscal Year 2022***

**Total revenue** is expected to be between $540 million to $570 million.

**Adjusted EBITDA\*** is expectedto be between $121 million to $132 million.

I know I am writing about $DTC for 2 month now, but everything is lining up perfectly to explode in a few weeks, all I write is based on my opinion, however I put my money were my mouth is."|1.0|3|0|3

I follow speculation far more than anything. You have to in growth companies.

The freescape webarchive leak was literally a free ticket to understanding what Vinco is planning.

Everything about the company revolves around non lhysical assets. Call it a covid stock. A stay at home play. A reccession stock. Whatever. But...it's also the future. The future is less waste. Less ties to brick/mortar. More ties to a digital future.

Digital ecosystem. A digital life. That's the heart of web3. When instead of just firing up a console game, you log into whichever world you choose through literally any browser of your choosing to access your digital assets and interact with others however way you see fit.

Huge firms have invested billions into start ups the last 4 years. It's the future. Big brands developing digital store fronts to be compatible across multiple blockchains. Think of them as widgets like you have on your phone. You'll see Nike widgets in game, Shopify, Gucci...you name it. You'll be buying a interoperable nft that you can use as a in game skin for shoes that also triggers a delivery of the exact same pair of shoes to your house in real life. That's just the dumbed down explanation.

Vinco made hints all year long at connecting EVERYTHING in web3. Nexus City hired a ton of devs a long time ago in India. Nexus City Holdings llc is featured within freescape as one of the partners. Nexus City is another branch of the web3 ecosystem. Another ""world"". A hub. So, obviously Lomo will be marketted within Nexus as well. That means web3 influencers, web3 advertising, web3 events...concerts...seminars. You name it. VR integration. Augmented reality. It's starting.

Money won't be a problem guaranteed. The whole world is adopting and adapting to a digital life. This is the pioneer junction. The moment switches get flicked.

With the sec quiet period over, that's it. Floodgates are open. You'll hear from management like crazy. You'll see devs drop the latest updates. Lips are unsealed.

I'm not one for doing everyone's homework for them, or pursuading people. So here, discords that have all the answers you need if you ask the right questions. Get involved. Socialize. Be a part of what's coming instead of reacting to it after it explodes.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vudu03/the_us_adds_372000_jobs_in_june_and_a_robust/)

**Unemployment rate stays at 3.6% in June**

https://preview.redd.it/2m6zx0198da91.jpg?width=700&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3a1c5b5dd3f2e013c626d3fd25452c525231d01d

**The numbers:** The U.S. created a robust 372,000 new jobs in June, confounding predictions of a big slowdown in hiring and signaling the economy has some zip left despite growing talk of recession.

Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast 250,000 new jobs.

The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.6%, the government said Friday, just a a tick above the pre-pandemic low.

The strong gains in employment this year are unlikely to last, however.

For one thing, the biggest shortage of labor in decades is unlikely to ease soon, making it hard for companies that still want to hire to do so.

The Federal Reserve is also sharply raising U.S. interest rates to try to reverse the worst outbreak of inflation in 40 years. Higher rates tend to slow the economy by making it more costly to buy a home or car or to take out a business loan.

The central bank wants to reduce the boiling-over labor market to a simmer. The labor crunch has boosted worker pay by the largest amount since the 1980s and helped families cope with rising prices, but it would be harder for the Fed to bring down inflation if rapid wage gains persist.

Hourly pay rose a solid 0.3% in June to $32.08, but wage growth is slowing. The increase in pay over the past year slipped again to 5.1% from 5.3% in the prior month and 5.6% in the early spring.

In a potentially bad omen, the size of the labor force fell for the second time in three months. The labor force tends to stagnate when hiring slows or jobs become harder to find.

The share of the working-age population 16 or older who either have jobs or are looking for one slipped to 62.2% from 62.3%, leaving it well below the pre-pandemic peak.

**Big picture:** A smorgasbord of recent reports suggest the economy is slowing. It‚Äôs even possible the economy could shrink for the second quarter in a row ‚Äî the typical definition of a recession.

Yet while many economists believe a recession is increasingly likely in the next year, they also say the U.S. is in OK shape for now.

Consumers are spending enough money to keep the wheels of the economy turning and businesses are still hiring and investing. Gasoline prices have also fallen recently and could give Americans temporary relief.

**Key details:** The increase in hiring in June was broad based.

Professional employment rose by 74,000 to lead the way. Some tech companies are holding the line on new hires, but other white-collar firms are still adding jobs.

Bars, restaurants, hotels and other companies in the hospitality business created 67,000 new jobs, reflecting pentup demand among consumers to go out again as the pandemic loses its grip on the routines of daily life.

Employment also rose by 57,000 in health care, 36,000 in warehousing and transportation and 29,000 in manufacturing.

The private sector has now recovered all 21 million jobs it lost in the first two months of the pandemic. Employment rose to 129.8 million in June from 129.6 million in February 2020.

The only decline in jobs took place in government, and it was a small one at that.

**Looking ahead:** ‚ÄúJune‚Äôs strong job growth, especially in the teeth of high inflation, shows that the expansion remains on solid ground,‚Äù said corporate economist Robert Frick of Navy Federal Credit Union.

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs report will only embolden the Fed to hike rates by another 75 basis points later this month, which is why we expect the economy to stall and come close to recession at the turn of the year,‚Äù said senior economist Sal Guatieri at BMO Capital Markets.

**Market reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, 0.21% and S&amp;amp;P 500 SPX, 0.24% fell slightly in Friday trades. Stocks lost ground after the better-than-expected jobs report on the view that it will force the Fed to aggressively raise interest rates.**

Have a look at Vertex Energy, this oil &amp; diesel fuel producer has recently had a mini squeeze from 8$ to 18$, this happened after $VTNR announced in their Q1 earnings call, that they successfully started their refinary at 90% capacity in April.

Allthough $VTNR beat their earnings expectations with 130m revenue yoy for Q1, their revenue is expected to rise to $3.1Billion. Valued like other oil Company $VTNR\`s share price should rise from 10.20$ currently to 30$-40$ per share.

Because of the Q2 oil price explosion due to the war, those estimates will most likely be crushed, which should lead to an even bigger price explosion.

Many shorts put their money on $VTNR\`s failure, but to their detriment the $VTNR management outperformed analysts expectations by far.

Valued at 10.20$ with a Market Cap of $661M this company is a Cash printing press. $VTNR offers a rare opportunity to **join a upcoming squeeze ahead of time** and make maximum gains in the meanwhile.

&amp;#x200B;

[As you can see $VTNR nicely bottomed out at their previous support right now and is poised to make a real squeeze after its recent mini-squeeze.](https://preview.redd.it/93ecdi58p1a91.png?width=1031&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4abb854d8d79f360c1dc197f2f1a9b283b1fbaa0)

As you can imagine, if a 130M revenue send this stock from 8$ to 18$ imagine what 3.1B end of year can do. Shorts are already fleeing this company, because they regret their mistake, however 7.81M shares are still shorted, ""only"" 13.39% of the FF. If you consider those 7.81M shares make up over 3 Day-to-Cover, its easy to see why shorts will still have a hard time covering once $VTNR makes it next move on Aug. earnings.

Up until now $VTNR wasnt a profitable company, hence its low share price. But once it has established a reliable diesel production, this company moves to the fair oil industry average, which currently lies three times above the current share price.

Right now $VTNR is very undervalued and oversold, even though oil went down another 5% today $VTNR almost hold steady. The best thing is, $VTNR as a refinary, makes its money not through the global oil price, but through the price of global crack spreads.

Those Crackspreads keep on rising lately, while algorithms automatically dump oil shares together with a sinking oil price. Once Aug. earnings sink in, the share price will move back up to its real value.

If we take a look at Vertex Energy's guidance, we have to consider two main metrics, used for evaluating Oil Companies.

Vertex Energy ($VTNR) currently has a Market Capitalization of $661M, this is dirt cheap in comparison to other Oil &amp; Gas Companies. It is only the case, because $VTNR will just start to be massively profitable beginning from this Quarter. Whenever a company changes from unprofitable to profitable there can be a huge share price spike observed. The higher the Short interest of the company at Earnings the higher the Price spike potentially is.

The Adjusted net income is expected to be $235M to $255M, this can be used to calculated the Price-to-Earnings ratio, the avr. Oil Company is currently worth 11.3x their end-of-year earnings. (Source Simplywall.st)

This puts $VTNR\`s fair value according to the End-of-year P/E ratio at $2.5B-$2.7B.

The second metric which has the most influence on Oil companies is the Price-to-Sales ratio (P/S).

The average Oil Company is currently worth 1.2x of their revenue. $VTNR however currently is worth 0.2x of their End-of-Year revenue.

Measured by this metric $VTNR\`s fair share lies over $3.6B, more then 5x their current share price.

Ofc there are many different factors going into a good valuation, so the examples above only provide a rough guidance. However I expect $VTNR to make a huge price spike on its Aug. earnings, fueled by the remaining shorts, that will be crushed by the huge gains, made during the recent explosion in diesel fuel price. Here is a short guidance of what the management expects for End of Year results, confirmed in mid May.

For the **full-year 2022**, Vertex currently anticipates:

* Gross Profit in a range of $440 million to $460 million
* Adjusted Net Income in a range of $235 million to $255 million
* Adjusted EBITDA in a range of $340 million to $360 million
* Adjusted Free Cash Flow in a range of $150 million to $175 million

Anyone joining $VTNR couldn't find a better entry point, because the absolute bottom resistance lies at 9.60, which might hardly be reached.

Today almost 20% of shorts closed their positions, because they know $VTNR won't go any lower and this is the lowest price they will be able to cover.

&amp;#x200B;

[Shorts are fleeing in droves, while the oil price is going lower. Q2 earnings however are already set in stone and will make stock price explode.](https://preview.redd.it/sqnncxg9p1a91.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcc32b7070be84d39c9968868eb17f9042a09c89)

There are only few set ups which are more reliable then this one and while people usually promote squeezes that are already happening, I wanted to offer a future squeeze with huge potential and a very good risk/benefit ratio.

I own shares and 12.5c 15c Oct. Calls. The more we stack up the Oct. option chain the harder gamma we will get. I would say. LFG!"|0.5|0|0|0

A breakout to the top would trigger a huge buying signal for algorithm and professional traders. Keep an eye on it, this could be a great opportunity|"After a 6 month falling knife Solo Brands $DTC managed to stop the downward trend and made a bullish reversal pattern on the daily chart. Right now we are moving between two important moving averages and a breakout to the top at 4.54$ will trigger a great Buying signal.

Its still possible to make another dip before the breakout, which is not a bad sign as long as we don't breach the 4.21$ resistance.

So any breakout above 4.55$ or dip to 4.21$ represents good entry points, as the underlying company performed alot better then analysts expected in the last 2 quarters.

$DTC has 93.4% institutional ownership, so smart money is accumulating this stock since February in anticipation for a great bounce upwards.

The CEO and CFO of $DTC bought their own shares end of May, which is pretty bullish as well, because they have insider knowledge about the Q2 quaterly earnings in August.

If you are interested put this stock onto your watchlist and keep an eye on it.

[Once the share price breaks through the dark blue 35Day Moving Average + the downward trend channel, this stock has potential for a great run up.](https://preview.redd.it/asfy61vjuz991.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f72e52dede5163264fa7f7c2bb1bac45ec881afd)

Several metrics point towards a nice run up, besides the Q2 earnings expectations, $DTC has a very low free float (7.45M), this means there are only a few shares available and very little volume is needed to make $DTC\`s share price move.

Yesterday premarket 300 shares moved this stock 17% upwards, which is definitively not normal. Once a buy in signal is triggered I expect a rapid increase in stock price.

Full disclosure: I own $DTC shares @ 3.88$ and 5$ Nov. Calls. If you are interested there are great comprehensive DD\`s on the DTC subreddit. Do your own research, it might be worth it."|0.67|2|0|2

That will trigger Algo and Fomo to join the party. The more retail accumulate now the harder it will Pop. Bullish AF|"# Hi there,

Since IPO this stock has fallen of a cliff, but its profitable and is heavily undervalued compared to competitors in Online retail, like $AUOT or $YETI. Fair valuation lies at 13.33$ according to 7 financial analysts. Combine this with 2.8M Short Interest and over 4 Day-to-Cover and there is no easy way out for shorts, except to buy back shares and detonate the share price.

Long institutions hold over 94% of all shares with an average buy-in price of 13.92$, they are in it for the long haul, so if retail grabs the remaining float now this stock is an easy multi bagger.

Q2 earnings is going to be the catalyst for the pop, in my opinion. In anticipation of Q2 earnings even the CEO and CFO of $DTC almost half a million dollar in shares on the free market, which is Bullish AF.

The saying goes, there are many reason for insiders to sell their stocks, but only one reason for them to buy.

Lets screw those shorts and make this thing go crazy, shorts thought $DTC is going to fail, but they beat expectations multiple times now.

If you check the Technical analysis and see how much the short term trend reversal made this bounce, the long term trend reversal will be much much harder.

&amp;#x200B;

[Short Term downward trend channel was broken end of May, the stock made a bullish double bottom since and hasn't dropped below All-Time-Low despite the big market crash afterwards.](https://preview.redd.it/5azi7osgk4991.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20749db0e53299237b01a5772d65ef8547a40180)

When we Broke the Short term downward Trend $DTC went from 3.66$ to 5.51$ in 2 days, sadly the overall market crash choked the squeeze, but shorts haven't covered, so the squeeze was just delayed.

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the Trend line from $DTC\`s IPO end of Oct. 2021. If we break through this trend channel $DTC is going to fly.](https://preview.redd.it/rr4tmaxhk4991.png?width=879&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=323219cffcb3fb15e354758f348241cc3e571e64)

Ortex is showing only 19% SI, because they miss calculated the free float. Much more sophisticated analyst tools like Bloomberg Terminal and S3, show the real free float to be at 7.44M shares and SI around 40% of free float. I lost access to those, so if someone has an account their pls post it and/or message me.

Another interesting fact is, that the average age of shorts is 64 days, which makes the average short position opened in the 7-8$ price range. This is very good for us, right now shorts can make extreme profits by closing their positions. Once the long term trend reversal signal happens they will try to lock in profits making the stock price run like crazy.

The last point I want to make, in comparison to many other squeeze plays, $DTC has excellent long term value and fundamentals, making this one of the safest plays I ve ever seen. Ofc there is always some remaining risk, but the risk/benefit ratio is as good as it can be.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Goodmorning traders, we have reached the first of the month and you know what that means... New fund flows to money managers. All that money that has been automatically deducted from paychecks gets released to fund managers to get put to work starting today. For the longest time I use to take my keys from the bond market, if the bond market was on the bid and had high volume premarket that was a sign that the equity market was not going to do well and if the bonds were down with low volume, it was a sign that the equity market would do well that day. I haven't talked about or used this key much since the fed went cowboy crazy tying up and buying up bond products manipulating rates to stay low. Since the tightening of the balance sheet and rate hikes bonds are making a comeback. Bonds are no longer unattractive pieces of paper. Money managers are starting to have a choice again on where to put money for gains. You're probably wondering what it has to do with today's market...Well in recent years when new fund flows hit it was about guaranteed that that money was headed straight to the equity market (where else were you going to put money in hopes of a decent return, because of the fed and manipulated low bond yields it cause everybody even people who didn‚Äôt mess with the equity market to have to hunt stocks in the equity market in hopes of some type of return on their money). So, for the last few years of this Fed induced bull bubble the 1st thru 3rd was always bullish making you most people forget the natural order of things. Because we are traders, we get caught up in always looking at the indexes or key stocks to gauge the overall market but in fact the last few years it's been the tail wagging the dog and we have forgotten which one is the dog. The equity market is the small tail that takes its keys and scraps from the bond market and not the other way around as it has been in this fed induced bizarro world. In 2016(sorry best info I could pull up on short notice) the bond market had a notional value of 92.2 trillion with the U.S accounting for 43% of that while the Equity market had a notional value of 70.1 trillion with the U.S accounting for 39% of that. So, you see Bonds are back and the 1st ‚Äì3rd isn‚Äôt going to be as easy to navigate as it has been. 

Key levels to watch for ... Resistance (jack)376-377, (queen)378-380 and (king)381-386 area. Support (jack)375-374(queen)373-372 and (King)371-368.

t3_vomozf|1656633538|Wallstreetbetsnew|Found a great analysis of Solo Brands $DTC, which just made a double bottom and offers a great opportunity for Q2 earnings in Aug. Let me know what you think.|"## Introduction and Thesis

Operating via four separate sites, Solo Brands (NYSE:DTC) utilizes its expertise in direct-to-consumer e-commerce to drive sales in outdoor lifestyle products. Since its founding in 2011, Solo Brands has grown by the addition of three brands, offering adequate diversification, and shows no plans in slowing down this expansion both in new brands and in entering various global markets. Having started with one brand, Solo Stove offering outdoor heating and cooking solutions, they have since been able to offer clothes, kayaks, and paddle boards with multiple site additions.

Despite stable revenue streams that are poised to grow substantially in the future according to analysts (69.9% FWD), shares have begun trading at an extreme discount to what Solo Brands has to offer. Add in an improving business model that has clearly outlined company objectives with a promising technical rebound, shares should have no trouble ascending to previous levels once this value is realized.

## Catalysts; Driving Future Growth

Down massively from all-time highs achieved near its late October IPO, Solo Brands has not shown any radical deterioration in fundamentals that would give reason to it now being considered as a penny stock (sub $5 per share). Despite this fall that many attribute to inflationary concerns among consumers, management appears driven to abide by their five-step growth model which should give way to immense shareholder returns. Chief Executive Officer John Merris has set the company's focus on the following: product innovation, leveraging customer data, entering new markets, improving customer relations, and continuing acquisitions. In order, we will be looking over each dynamic and see what value can be introduced to Solo Brands and why, together, they lead to a bullish stance.

#### Product Innovation

Looking to further take advantage of excellent gross margins (currently around 66%), Solo Brands continues development across each of their four brands in order to ensure each customer's needs, and any gaps within the market, are fulfilled. In fact, each of their four brands have done quite well given a focus on innovation thus far; for instance, their Solo Stove brand recently introduced heat deflectors to their line up and in the words of John Merris:

&gt;Our much anticipated heat deflectors, rolled out in the first quarter and we have sold over 26,000 units, which is well ahead of our internal expectations"" (Q1 earnings Call).

Assuming this trend of outpacing expectations to show up in each of the brands, as it already has in Oru recently offering an introductory-level Kayak, catering innovation to customer needs will further revenue growth.

#### Leveraging Customer Data

Making use of their customer database, containing 3 million shoppers, Solo Brands intends to further their ability to both innovate (understanding customer needs) and bring customers between different sites. So far with the latter, they have had 42,677 customers who have purchased from more than just one of their sites. Recently, there has been continued interest among management to take advantage of this opportunity:

&gt;We believe that the investments we are making to mobilize our data should yield significant returns this year and for the years ahead"" (Q1 earnings Call).

#### Entering New Markets and Building Relations

Having already gained momentum in several regions beyond the United States, such as Canada and certain parts of Europe, Solo Brands is allowing their flagship brand, Solo Stove, to lead the way into new markets; namely, Australia in the third quarter. From there, they intend to slowly introduce new brands into Australia as more customer data is obtained to more effectively market their different outdoor products.

In entering and expanding in these new markets, of which they believe they have under 2% of the market share for each brand, they are looking to form closer customer relations. With those relations, so far, they have boasted a positive referral rate of approximately 40% and with such a large, established, customer base, they are looking to capitalize on these positive interactions to further future sales. Especially as Solo Brands remains committed to expanding its product offerings via new acquisitions, their strong shopper base which consists of 50% returning customers looks to provide generous returns whenever entering a new market.

#### Strategic Acquisitions

Building upon their intentions to further penetrate the outdoor lifestyle market beyond their 2% share is the potential for future acquisitions that fit into their current portfolio of brands. With that, they would also take advantage of their Net Promoter Score in the 70s indicating they would be able to continue transferring customers from one site to another with relative ease.

&gt;We continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions and are enthusiastic about the opportunities we are seeing. Our focus here is unchanged and we look to find unique, disruptive, profitable brands"" (Q1 Earning Call).

## Valuation

Given the difficulty which comes with utilizing a DCF in the case of a startup, or at least a business that has high levels of cash flow fluctuations, making use of public comparable appears to be the greatest approach in gaining a deeper understanding of how Solo Brands is trading so cheap. A great example of such a peer would be American Outdoor Brands (AOUT) which, like Solo Brands, is over 70% off highs in light of inflationary concerns. Despite this, American Outdoor still trades at a higher multiple of over 6x earnings even with less promising revenue growth entering the near-term future. Add in their less-attractive gross margins, one may see that Solo Brands is being overlooked given its likely-superior fundamentals.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cgheh65cku891.png?width=635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af962965632b5e9367e36dc01b928656cf0f125

Even after calculating a Net Current Asset Value Per Share (NCAVPS) lower than where shares are trading today ($2.02 versus $4.31), the trend in lowering shares outstanding should aid in the process of placing this number above where shares can be acquired. This strong likelihood comes when looking at the company's historical reduction in shares outstanding, enabling the NCAVPS to increase comfortably.

## Technical Strength; Moving Off Lows

With inflation being the primary culprit in share prices falling heavily from all-time highs achieved following the 2021 IPO, solid earnings since have proven consumers are not abandoning outdoor living products. Especially considering that the products which Solo Brands offers across its various sites are specifically tailored towards the needs of their customers (proven by their substantial customer relations), it is highly unlikely that this trend of impressive sales will let up anytime soon. Foreseeing a bright future fundamentally in Solo Brands, technical analysis reinforces that now is the time to invest in this well-diversified, deep value, stock.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ok1hhtn8ku891.png?width=3655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f5d39a4837063c20aa07f440a4ec31505098fda

Seeing that a level of support has been formed around the $4 mark, a secondary rebound off this point would lead to the belief that this is a potential double bottom scenario wherein there is (historically) a 78.5% chance of success that it leads to a bullish trend afterward. Furthering the possibility for a bullish trend is the positive movement in the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) that appears to have enough momentum for entering a bullish period in the coming weeks and months. Given the technical strength, share price appreciation looks promising both in the short term and eventually, backed by an excellent business model, moving into the distant future.

## Risks Moving Forward

Like most other equities, Solo Brands has faced a fair share of inflationary pressure, as reflected in their share price decline since its IPO, a time wherein the dollar has lost 4.65% of its value according to the CPI. And although management has advised that fluctuations in their earnings will persist into the second quarter, they are doubling down on their earlier-proven strategy of growth.

&gt;\[C\]onsumers \[are\] continuing to feel the pressures of higher inflation, which is impacting their spending. In times like these we believe offering innovation becomes increasingly important"" (Q1 Earnings Call)

This dedication to improving the underlying business despite a slight hiccup in sales indicates a long-term focus for management, something that can be appreciated given the current, low, multiple Solo Brands is trading at. Furthering their long-term outlook is the lack of dividend payments, instead, this revenue is diverted to fuel further growth in light of another risk: heightened rates. So far, increasing interest rates have been navigated quite well; namely, their earlier acquisitions (all three of which occurring in 2021) should allow the company to weather (possibly avoid) expensive funding. Eventually, when more cash is on hand (currently $15.9M), the company can comfortably move into additional acquisitions as per their outlined plan.

## Final Thoughts

With inflation taking a hit on almost every company in some measure, Solo Brands has seen similar damage to their share price, but not necessarily to their fundamentals. During this time, management has taken steps to ramp up growth prospects and has allowed investors the opportunity to take advantage of this deep value. With technical factors pointing to nearby gains, fundamental factors will more than likely continue this trend well into the future. With that, share prices should have no issue ascending to IPO-level prices and, depending on how management's plan performs entering the distant future, much higher.

Edit: This analysis is not my own, but had to share it, because It is so well written. I m long on this $DTC and own Nov. Calls , give me constructive feedback of what you think. In the past I did make some good prediction with stocks that popped quite well, I wrote DD\`s on $bkkt before it went from 8$ to 50$, on $Sprt before it went from 5.50$ to 59$ and some others. Not saying $DTC will move up that extremly, but it has decent potential as 7 diffrent market analysts rate it 13.33$ on avr. right now."|0.76|9|0|9

Goodmorning traders, there is a lot to discuss that stems back to yesterday and where we closed (I hinted at some of this in yesterday's premarket video). First, we catalyst type events kicking off all thru the overnight session and this morning. We have jobless claims, GDP, Chicago PMI, EIA Natural gas report and team all that up with today is a quarterly expiration; all that equals big move. Now going back to yesterdays close, we closed at a place technically that was right on the edge of a channel and quantitatively it was right on the edge of risk. I spoke awhile back about the options market growing inability to price in risk and when we get outside of that risk area the professionals have to dynamically hedge with futures (if outside of the risk line to the top they must buy into buying to hedge or in our case now sell into selling to hedge). Once we get outside of the risk line and firms began to dynamically hedge it‚Äôs a free for all, and we could have wild frantic movement and go into moments of free fall. A lot of notional value (large contract size) has to be closed and rolled today. We could see a day where indexes are down as much as 3% to 5% or better. Now from the technical side I usually won‚Äôt add to positions when we are sitting on a pivot and momentum indicators are at kind of a 50/50 level but because of all of the other data I felt that it was worth risk adding two small puts 5jul22 380 at about 2pm yesterday. Now that we are outside of the market makers expected move small level don‚Äôt matter to me as much but major channels do. The lower part of the channel we are in is 364 and the major channel low below that is 353. Other events to think about is that the first is on Friday and this brings new fund flows and CPI data drop before market. Looking at these two events if we don‚Äôt hit a channel low today how big of a gap down could we start with on Friday?

Key levels to watch for ... Resistance (jack)376-377, (queen)378-380 and (king)381-384 area. Support (jack)374-373(queen)372-370 and (King)369-364. Believe it or not the main thesis was Bullish closing above 380.34 with a projected target/high of between 381-384. Alt thesis is Bearish bias closing below 380.34 projected target/low 371-364.The current channel we are in 379-364 the next channel lower 364-353. Scenarios for the day:

1)¬† Trend day down we open gap down and start with a pop back toward the previous close. We find resistance on or before the previous close then begin the downtrend for the morning.

We could get a continued push higher toward jack¬†or queen resistance area and find midday chop around either queen or king resistance before spending the same energy we used going up to go back down the second half of the day or vice versa.¬† **38% probability**

3) Expanded Range Day structure. We could look to set a decision area/ low boundary around the jack or queen support area before chopping back and forth and pushing boundaries lower. Or vice versa **20% probability**"|1.0|7|0|7

We have barely half a million Volume atm, so if volume picks up this stock will detonate hard.

Close to the 4$ lvl is like a super cheap entry point, CEO/CFO bought shares in Q2, so I expect Solo Brands ($DTC) to have decent earnings in August.

Everything is pointing to a nice bounce in the near future, just be patient, in a couple of weeks I m pretty sure it will pay off. With almost a dollar EPS projected end of year this really looks like shorts miss calculated hard and are about to get punished. They are really trying hard for the last couple of weeks to keep this under 5, but once we get closer to august/nov. options. They wont be able to suppress it much longer.

This comes, because institutions bought over 93% of the Free float and their average buy in price is at 13.92, so they are in it for the long haul and once retail grabs the remaining float, shorts are pretty much toast.

Elon Musk said electric carmaker Tesla is ‚Äúlosing billions of dollars‚Äù and trying not to ‚Äúgo bankrupt‚Äù because of China‚Äôs supply chain disruptions.

The Tesla chief executive said a shortage of batteries and machinery tools stuck in Chinese ports is taking a heavy toll on output and revenue, with the US and German factories most affected.

**Helbiz (HLBZ) Signs Letter of Intent to Acquire Wheels, Accretive Acquisition Expected to Double Revenue. Look at the Resumes on Some of the Wheels Executives. Wheel's Executives Held Previous Positions at Uber, Lyft, Tesla, Zipcar, Bird, Ford and More.**

**This acquisition is a huge catalyst for HLBZ.**

Good day everyone,

**Helbiz, Inc. (NASDAQ: HLBZ)** offers a diverse fleet of vehicles including e-scooters, e-bicycles, and e-mopeds in the fast growing the micro-mobility services sector along with a media segment and food delivery.

Current price $.89/share (+7% as of 9:35 a.m. EDT 6-21-22)

After closing the past Friday‚Äôs session with an 18% gain to $.83/share, HLBZ opened today‚Äôs session strong on news of an accretive acquisition, jumping to $.92/share with over one million shares traded in the first few minutes.

In [news that just broke this morning](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helbiz-signs-letter-intent-acquire-124500791.html), and could be a major catalyst for HLBZ‚Äôs value, the company announced that they signed a letter of intent to acquire Wheels, a leading last-mile, shared electric mobility platform using proprietary vehicles with integrated helmet technology. The company‚Äôs mix of business includes shared mobility, a subscription business, and a B2B operation, partnering with businesses to provide their employees and patrons with a vehicle as a benefit.

**The acquisition will give HLBZ immediate and broader access to the U.S. market.**

Wheels has eight thousand vehicles deployed across major U.S. markets, including New York City, Honolulu, and Austin. Wheels is the only operator across the four permitted markets of metropolitan Los Angeles (L.A., Santa Monica, West Hollywood, and Culver City). In total, Wheels operates in twelve cities and four universities across the United States.

**Wheels was founded in 2018 and is led by veterans of the micro-mobility and shared transportation industries including Zipcar, Bird, and Uber**. ""Our businesses are complementary in really powerful ways,"" said Marco McCottry, CEO of Wheels. McCottry was formerly Midwest operations manager at Uber and led North American operations at Bird.

About Wheels [https://takewheels.com/](https://takewheels.com/)  
Wheels is a last mile, shared electric mobility platform whose seated form factor changes the landscape in dockless mobility. In addition to being seated, Wheels devices have a low center of gravity and 14-inch wheels to help navigate uneven pavement surfaces. Wheels has launched a first-of-its-kind integrated helmet system that can give riders physical access to a shareable helmet with every ride they take. Because of its unique design, Wheels devices have a broad appeal, with half of its riders being women and one-third being over 35. Wheels is headquartered in West Hollywood, California.

Stay tuned for a full report on this exciting catalyst for HLBZ.

**original report below**  
**Revenues are Rising Fast at Helbiz (HLBZ) in a Hot Sector with a 17% CAGR and the CEO Just Spent Over $2M Buying up Helbiz Stock**

Gas prices are setting the micro-mobility market on fire.

Good morning and welcome to all of our new trading group members,

Gas prices are just one factor boosting the micro mobility market and **Helbiz, Inc. (NASDAQ: HLBZ)** is a leader offering a diverse fleet of vehicles including e-scooters, e-bicycles, and e-mopeds in the fast growing micro-mobility services sector. Helbiz operates a fast growing media segment and food delivery / ghost kitchen service as well.

**Current price $.83/share as of the close on 06/17/22**

HLBZ looks ready to pop as the company keeps adding elements to its different operating segments and growing revenues. HLBZ derives half its revenues from the micro-mobility market and the other half from its media subscriptions. **Coming soon may be notable revenues from its ghost kitchen/food delivery segment.**

**There‚Äôs a lot to like at HBLZ**

**FYE is 12-31, MRQ is 3-31-22**  
Outstanding shares 19.8M  
Shares in float 8.7M  
Insider ownership 81.1%  
Revenues (ttm) $15.1M  
Q122 revenues up 266% over Q121  
FYE2021 revenue up 290% over FYE2020  
Market cap $28.3M (P/S is only 1.80X)

On June 6th, the company announced that **CEO Salvatore Palella purchased 2,044,676 common shares** from a seller at $.99/share bringing the executive‚Äôs total holdings in the company to 4,544,676 common shares. Mr. Palella commented ""This purchase today is a personal commitment from me on the future of the company and our continued success.""

**Recent developments / potential catalysts:**

Approximately 3,000 leased e-Scooters delivered on March 1, expanding fleet in service.

Expanding operations into Miami Dade County, Belgrade Serbia, Charlotte N.C.

Partnership with Google Maps.

Added Major League Baseball (MLB) on the Helbiz Live platform.

Agreement with Amazon Prime to offer Helbiz Live Platform.

**HLBZ operates three revenue streams and sells subscriptions to their apps giving customers access to their products:**

**Mobility** ‚Äì Operating globally in 40 cities. HLBZ has thousands of e-scooters, e-bicycles, and e-mopeds parked all over these cities. Quite simply, clients locate the nearest transport they need on the app, go to it, and scan the QR code to unlock it and then go. The app also ensures you are properly parked when finished. **In addition to all vehicles being electric, every component of a HLBZ transport device is recyclable.**

**Kitchen** ‚Äì HLBZ delivers food and is currently developing their Helbiz Kitchen segment already operating in Milan. Using the ghost kitchen concept allows customers to mix cuisines in a single order with a quick delivery using an environmentally friendly transport.

**Helbiz Media** \- is a live sports and entertainment platform focused primarily on live coverage of Series B Soccer. The service, available by subscription, is available on mobile, tablet, on the web, or on smart TV and covers twenty clubs with over 390 matches as well as playoffs.

Recently the company signed an OTT service agreement to broadcast MLB games in Italy for the next three seasons. **A recent agreement with Amazon will allow for a subscription to Helbiz Live to be purchased through Amazon Prime. That‚Äôs big- time exposure!**

According to Precedence research, the Micro-mobility Market was estimated at $48.1B in 2021 and is expected to grow to $198B by 2030 indicating a CAGR of 17%. The research cites factors such as fuel prices, road congestion, and limited parking in cities as factors for an elevated level of growth in the sector.

The chart set up indicated below looks primed for continued gains after the 18% swing in last Friday‚Äôs session. The low RSI (14) of 38.15 indicates to me this stock is oversold. Trading volumes in the month of June have been higher than the preceding five months this year indicating significant investor interest.

We have a lot more to cover with Helbiz, keep an eye out for an updated report coming soon.

[https://www.cityam.com/onlyfans-the-uk-success-story-and-online-safety-pioneer/](https://www.cityam.com/onlyfans-the-uk-success-story-and-online-safety-pioneer/)

‚ÄúAs one of Europe‚Äôs fastest growing companies, with a 2021 revenue well over $300m and a compound annual growth rate of 400 per cent, you may be asking yourself whether OnlyFans‚Äô growth is sustainable, especially as post-pandemic world emerges and the cost of living crunch forces people to cut subscriptions and luxuries?

While Gan managed to gloss over the matter, stating ‚ÄúI think ultimately it is about people and their priorities‚Äù, she instead focused on the opportunities that can be found in the ‚ÄòGreat Resignation‚Äô, with people turning away from traditional career routes and into the arms of the creator economy, worth an estimated $20bn.

As its global HQ, Gan said London was an ‚Äúincredible home base‚Äù for OnlyFans‚Äô ambitions, revealing her personal plans to spend an increasing amount of time in the capital.

When asked whether this was related to rumours that the company was gearing up for a London IPO, Gan refused to comment. But, what she did say was that a future of some kind was clearly in the City.‚Äù

Goodmorning traders, reading back thru some post and emails I said one of my rules was not to short a vertical MACD and someone requested another rule I abide by. Well, another rule I try to abide by is that I usually don‚Äôt buy on up days or short on down days (exception for intraday trading and positions). These are normally swing positions. I hunt for stocks that don‚Äôt fully participate in rallies to start the screening process to short and stocks that don‚Äôt fully participate in sell offs to start the screening process to buy. One of the big parts in this process is looking at the event calendar and understanding what events are likely catalyst for big moves and planning around that. This week we have a FOMC announcement on Wednesday and this is a likely catalyst for a downside move so I have to start looking for any rallies no matter how small to short in front of the FOMC announcement or vice versa if you think it‚Äôs a catalyst to the upside. Planning ahead but not too far ahead that it blinds you to the technicals‚Äô of the day. Now last week I was on track to do the same until a rumor (cpi was leaked a day before, which kicked off the selling a day earlier) report got ahead of me instead of me being ahead of the calendar. Be very careful as the market shows its inefficiency to price in risk things will get crazy. Also, I have hinted that we are in or headed for a structural bear market. Even if we get this capitulation moment, I have been looking for soon, you have to understand that a structural bear market could have at least 4 legs to it where we trend down then have and amazing rally that could last a couple of months before resuming down trend. Just check the last structural bear market which was the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2009.

Key levels to watch for ... Resistance (jack)383-385, (queen)386-387 and (king)388-391 area and above. Support (jack)380-379(queen)378-376 and (King)375-372,370 and below. The main thesis is Bearish closing below 389.80 with a projected target/low of between 378-372. Alt thesis is Bullish bias closing above 389.8 projected target/high 385-391. The weekly bias is bullish with a retracement target of around 408. Also, remember the channel I pointed out several times last week. I said we are going to go test either the high or low end of that channel soon.¬† The current channel we are in 379-397, the next major channel is 379 down to 364. Scenarios for the day:

1. Trend day down we open gap down and start with a rally back toward the previous close. We find resistance on or before the previous close then begin the downtrend for the morning. We find midday chop around either possible queen or king support, however, it is highly likely that the market has tired itself out overnight so that the rally back could seem vast and it may be hard to push a lot further below the overnight lows but remember until we close above the previous close, we are still in down trend mode.¬† **38% probability**

2)¬† Rounded reversal day type structure. We could get a continued push higher toward jack or queen resistance area and find midday chop around either queen or king resistance before spending the same energy we used going up to come back down the second half of the day or vice versa.¬† **32% probability**

3)¬†Range Day structure. We could look to chop between recent or overnight highs and lows for a majority of the day. ¬†**30% probability**"|0.71|3|0|3
