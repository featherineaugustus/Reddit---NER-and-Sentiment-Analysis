Contract = 100 shares

LOPR (Large Option Positions Reporting, more than 200 contracts)

OTC Position Limit (250k contracts)

So, what this means is that 7.4 MILLION instances, BofAS had positions over 200 contracts they failed to properly report (could be long, could be short, no way to tell).  

If we just assume that those were always 201 contracts that needed reporting that is 1,487,400,00 contracts.  Each contract is 100 shares, or 148.74 Billion shares.

26 times, they violated the limit on OTC positions, 250k is the limit.  That is 6,500,000 contracts, or 650m million shares.

Imo, chat hasn't been a very positive extension of our sub anyway. More often than not it's the same dozen people in there controlling the conversation, ganging up on folks who stop by to share an opinion not liked by the chat.

Heres how I see it

Mega thread allows discussions to last for longer than 2 minutes, someone can comment something at 8am and people can respond all day, it doesn't immediately get buried by chat spam.

It allows people to discuss things that are not worthy of their own post, which either end up taking space in new, or getting buried and ignored altogether. It would likely also increase the quality of the rest of the posts if people can ask simple things in megathread. 

It is much easier to moderate and avoid brigades as downvotes will easily hide brigaders/shills and mods can clean up. 

If chat is going to remain locked, apes need a place to vent and discuss.

Daily chat can be fun in big green days, but more often than not its just the same thing every day. I think chat is fun for a small minority, while a megathread would be beneficial to the sub as a whole.

t3_xcdchz|1662990572|amcstock|Financial freedom is not selfish|"Hey everyone, just wanted to share a little about myself and what I think about the current situation. I'm an ape that has had a lot of blessings in life- I have great supportive family members and friends. I've had the opportunity to get a good education and pursue my passions. I haven't struggled to the degree that many of you have- you all definitely deserve this squeeze more than I do and my heart goes out to all of you. Even still, I really want this to happen sooner than later. I've been patient for almost 2 years and need to see positive changes in the market where justice prevails.

I mean, there's got to be more to life than working a 9-5, coming home for a few hours, then rinsing and repeating. I know some of you work even more than that- 50 or 60 hour work weeks with long commutes. I love reading your stories and have mad respect for you kind and hard-working apes just trying to get by and provide for your families. I want this squeeze to happen soon for myself, of course, but also so I can give back to my loved ones and make their lives just a little easier.

I hate living in a system where a handful of elites make the rules and only enforce them on us commoners. I hate living in a system where these elites can cheat, lie, and steal and only get a slap on the wrist, if even that, while they profit off of our misery and suffering. They're a bunch of dragons hoarding wealth while looking at us ""peasants"" with disdain, ready to burn us and our homes to the ground as soon as we have no money left for them to take. They sit on mountains of gold, so large that they couldn't spend it all in several lifetimes, let alone their own. These people treat life like a game of Monopoly and laugh at our suffering. They don't give a fuck about any of us and it's about time that changed.

I know many of you aren't asking for much. A lot of apes talk about lambos and mansions, but from what I've read, most of you just want financial freedom- the freedom to not worry about how you'll pay your next bills, the freedom to pursue your passions and interests, and the freedom to give back to your loved ones and provide for them so they don't have to suffer. I want that too. Now, don't misunderstand me when I say that. Please hold as long as you want 'til your personal price point is reached, I know I will. I'm just saying that we're not like the dragons- we have hearts and want to use our money for good and altruistic purposes.

Don't let anyone- your families, friends, and certainly not the shills or the media tell you that you're selfish. Even if you use all your gains for the most stupid, frivolous things, you're thousands of times less selfish than the Dragons of Wall St.

Dragons are notoriously difficult to kill, and they're not going to give us the weapons or knowledge to do so. But we've found their weakness, and they're bleeding out as we speak. I have no idea when they'll die- the corruption of the U.S. stock market knows no bounds as we've seen over the last couple years and continue to see, but eventually, we WILL slay them and redistribute their wealth back to the people who deserve it. We know their tactics now, and they're boring. The fact that just buying and holding is crippling them while they continue to break the rules should tell you all you need to know. After this is said and done, we'll build a kingdom where everyone can thrive and support each other. Stay strong apes, and take care. 

TL;DR- Hedgies are dragons hoarding gold. Soon we take gold and dance on their graves"|0.96|127|0|127

t3_xcbnnr|1662986100|amcstock|Hey Mr FED, here is an idea.|"As I sit here eating some crayons, a thought came to mind. 

You keep giving these banks and hedgies our money so they can kick the MOASS can for one or two more weeks before they need more money from you. By the way you give them taxpayers money, and in return they not only lose it but get big write offs, which means no tax revenue from these institutions for the IRS of the FED to collect. Not will they pay their fair share of taxes if they win, just like they have never paid their fair share in the past. 

I propose this (and a few other friends might like this) stop giving our tax money to the institutions; just let them get margin called, fail and let MOASS run. Guess what, once we sell, we will have to pay taxes, because your IRS friends will be paying close attention to our accounts. We will have to pay our short/long term taxes. We will need somewhere to put our money after paying taxes, I think some if not most Apes will use banks. 

If MOASS happens, we pay taxes, helping balance the Govs books and budget with this influx of money, via tax revenue and we put out money is banks “for safe keeping 🤣”, this method has Apes saving the gov and and banks. In this scenario Apes save the Gov and banks, and the FED can stop giving away our money to save the dammed. 

Everybody wins!

t3_xc7hxp|1662972111|amcstock|Why are they still selling AMC1 options that include APE ?|"
Please Correct/explain to me why , dont just call me FUD and thumbs me down like a BOT.

 So from my understanding APE isn’t suppose to have options , cool we all agree on that . So why are they still selling AMC1 options if they include APE .. I know from a normal split your existing options get adjusted accordingly . If its a 1 to 1 split and the float doubles  they would  give you 200 shares if exercised and the option also gets priced accordingly.

AMC1 is getting priced higher like any normal stock split option BUT why still sell it ? I understand we need to be fair for existing option holders (like my self, even tho I took a HUGE hit on the split) but why allow new long/ short  positions?
Doesnt this just contradict the whole no options for APE? 

Im not sure if they are creating new contract dates and strikes,  if one of you knows please share … 

Also From my understanding anyone who had options before the dividend, AMC1 contracts include amc and ape .. what about new contracts will I just get free ape ? Or do I get it at a special or the same strike price ? 

Sorry if this was spoken about before I couldn’t find an answer .

UPDATE|"I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/wvos6g/amc_preferred_equity_units_stuck_in_limbo_between/) a few weeks ago about initiating a transfer to CS right after the APE dividend was announced. These were XXXX AMC shares I'd owned through my Norwegian broker/bank since 2021. 

What I feared might happen did indeed happen; my AMC shares arrived, but CS was adamant that the transfer happened too late so that my broker would provide the APE units, while my broker in turn insisted that CS was responsible for providing them.

After a lot of back and forth I've at least managed to have my broker take the matter seriously, and stop directing me back to CS every time. (Since CS is not a broker they cannot contact the DTC, so they cannot resolve the situation that way.)

On friday however my broker received the following statement from their agent bank (Citi): 

&gt;""After some research, it appears that the below transaction was not a trade, but  a 'DTC Withdrawal by Transfer', which means a physical certificate was withdrawn from DTC to be re-registered.  This occured on 8/17, after record date of event of 8/15.""   

&gt;""DTC is still researching the entitlement allocation on those shares, as I don't believe the entitlement was allocated to Citi.  ""

**Question;**

Does anyone with more wrinkles than me know if this points to any shenanigans by my brokers agent bank or DTC? 

To me it sound like they tried to do exactly what I intended. I initiated a *transfer* of stocks i ""owned"", so no trade should be needed. However since the transfer was dated the 17th of august, which was after the date of record it should have been Citi/my broker that would be allocated the APE equity units on my behalf, right?"|0.98|401|0|401

although it may sound like it, this is no financial or any other advice.

I often read posts regarding 'post moass' spending or similar things, revolving around some or other expenditures one is going to make. I just commented on one and thought, that you may like to hear as well. If not - well, I will understand based on doots.

Believe it or not - the more and more luxurious stuff - of whatever make or sort - you get, the more stressful your life will become. It will never be enough and much like the famed dragon-chase - will keep getting less interesting.

Luxurious goods are *made* for you and everyone else to like them. That is the entire point. It *cannot* be any different.

Spending on luxuries  will just make you  a target for - you guessed it - your presumably biggest foe (as per being on this forum). And lots of other previously unknown best friends. And of course, you keep enriching people you probably do not wish to enrich.

Instead, live a meaningful life, like you try to do know.

Not meaning this personally - how could I  - just trying to help.

Enjoy your sunday.

I Bought AMC, Carnival Cruise Lines and United Airlines because I saw price opportunity with the pandemic. I ended up selling United and Carnival for a very nice profit after COVID relaxed.  I held on and bought more AMC, sold some in June to cover my cost and am sitting on XXXX lolling. No conspiracy, no short squeeze, no hedie fuk...I Bought AMC on fundamentals and like AA I've gotten lucky because of Apes.

They've done fuckall in the last year except release videos berating us as stupid meme investors, posts about milk and other dumb bullshit that doesn't matter. (Honestly slandering us could be considered market manipulation in itself as it's telling people not to invest because we're dumb money).

IF they really wanted to help they would bring the full weight of the DOJ, FBI and CIA down on these assholes. All it would take is GG saying ""We uncovered massive amounts of fraud, corruption and manipulation of the stock market by powerful HF's and we need help building a case against them to ensure that they don't get away with this"". That's it. He hasn't done that. If the government doesn't care, then go make a public statement saying they government doesn't care. If anything happens to him, IE, shot twice in the head while jumping off a building with a knife in his back, it's a smoking gun. 

They were never there to help us retail investors, and they never will be. GG is likely paid off, just like horse face Hester. They're just going to keep turning a blind eye and do nothing, so stop expecting them to do anything, because that help is never coming from them.

3- The Shorts hope that we sell AMC because we’ve made money. 

4- AMC squeezes on an un-disclosed date (At 2PM the following day after APE squeezes) or SEC does jack shit , allows further can kicking (because how would they mooch more money off of the hedges, duh). Making it squeeze at a later 2PM date.

t3_x9ftze|1662681237|amcstock|Wyckoff on the Memes Cont...|"I recently posted some work that I had done on our beloved ""meme stocks"" and I wanted to provide an update in the event that anyone has any input (for the better or worse... I recognize that I am not perfect and I value anyone's thoughts). 

Currently, the [schematic](https://imgur.com/a/5zWrxPm) is unclear exactly where we are at within this smaller distribution cycle, but based on the volume levels (selling volume is decreasing and buying volume is increasing), it appears as though we may have just completed our distribution phase and have entered ""Phase A"" of the next accumulation (I am guessing here bc it is not yet clear where we are at... Keep that in mind). What this means is that in the immediate future, we can likely look forward to some amount of continued push up (I suspect until around $9.50(ish); this is known as the automatic rally), immediately followed by a push back down into the $8.30-$8.60(ish) area; this is known as the secondary test. Following this, we will likely range trade for some amount of time before our next big move.

Again, I want to reiterate that AMC schematic is not yet clear, so my analysis is speculative.

t3_x9foix|1662680833|amcstock|TV junkie here.. my opinion on why platform streaming won't last 🎢|"Netflix - Production quality has dropped dramatically since post covid. Too many C/D grader series and movies are on the loose this year. Netflix are only banking on their existing renewal of trademark series to keep them afloat. The harsh reality is that the big names producers and crews have been reliant on movies for viewership and revenue.



Disney - Most of marvel series here are just back stories and second fiddlers to the ones on the big screen. You can choose to skip any of those and not miss out the main plot. Disney has also gone all out with their agendas and inclusivity and this might not politically bode well with a sizeable amount of population out there.



HBO / Amazon /Syfy - Series that cater to a niche range of audience. Doesn't cater well (and not even widely available) in the international scene. My pal works in one of those platform companies and told me marketing em in Asia is a huge struggle at the moment.



Those who claim movies theatres are dead have no idea how the industry works. No way the likes of Avatar, Top Gun and hundreds of other established and aspiring directors are gonna premier their big works on a streaming platform.


TV series are gonna survive on those platforms but it's gonna be a huge uphill to be consistently reliant on them. Most series go downhill after the 3rd season or so lol."|0.85|29|0|29

These SHF would rather see the economy crash and burn before willingly giving up and admitting they made a bad gamble and are now the ones holding overleveraged short positions with value equal to big steaming bags of elephant shit. A bad gamble that is big enough to and will bankrupt all of them. 

Now when it comes to financial news outlets - they are the last allowed to broadcast such negative news pieces to the masses. We all know that once the news start discussing such events, its already too late - it is at the point where it can not be fixed.  The majority of the time BUT NOT THIS TIME, before the news outlets are allowed to run such pieces, their financial backers/SHF/big players have been allowed to exit any position at risk from creating a market panic, just like we are seeing now. However, this time SHF are trapped and constantly racking up huge unrealized losses on their short gamble, and the negative market sentiment has become to big and obvious to continue to pretend to not notice.

The fact that we know that the SHF have not closed their short positions and that the news is now in Q3 2022 talking about scenarios that we knew would happen from 2021 not only solidifies the DD into stronger DIAMONDS but confirms that Hedgies are truly FUKT.

today I've been hit with the third person telling me a highly sensitive career thing is not going to work out and they don't have the 'capacity' to help me.

Each told me that after a while of consideration - the first one took 3 weeks to find out, that they don't have the 'capacity'. Everyone knew, that I'm on a strict timeline. It is now down to mere days.

Now at first this may look, as if it has nothing to do with all what is going on here. But it actually does, as I am defending a position, that no one would doubt, if the counterparty would not be the counterparty it is, but someone completely else.

After a while of others rejecting you with the same obvious baseless crap you may start to doubt your position. What if others are right? Others, who don't really know, what you are doing and don't really care?

If predatory shorting has been occurring in $AMC, then these same criminals will get just as deep into $APE to facilitate a faster demise of AMC as the goal is to bankrupt them so the naked shares do not have to be returned which exponentially maximizes their profits. To do this for both $AMC &amp; $APE is a temptation too great for criminals to resist because that could greatly multiply their profits for 2 tickers.

These same criminals also have no choice but to predatory short $APE share price as low as they can in order to deny AMC debt reduction from future sales of new issued $APE which could easily lead to $APE becoming way more shorted than $AMC. Oh what a tangled web we weave...

$APE options chain gearing up, predatory shorters maximize their positions postured to hide all the synthetics the same way they do $AMC while shorting that share price down as planned. Whoops, $APE isn't supposed to have an options chain, our bad probably should have clarified this before issuing. Too late now because the predatory shorters already leaped before they looked not knowing that fact beforehand, what a shame.

That in itself is enough to hodl waiting for them to fumble with all of those FTDs they can't hide with $APE options and sweating the deadlines for delivery while also trying to hide the accurate FTD data release with bribes and calling in favors to their crooked buddies at the SEC. Pressure cooker is getting ready to blow...

Potential Deathblow...Your broker has to report your shares to AMC for voting purposes, which also pressures them to deliver on IOUs for legal ownership purposes or overvote risking their reported shares not matching their ledger books. Sure would be a great time to have a company vote on something in the near future because then you would see if you actually got to vote all your $APE shares meaning they actually got delivered, or you would get to report to AMC that your broker didn't let you vote with shares your broker account statement shows you own which is something the broker would have to explain.

Remember that there is no options chain to hide FTD's. There are \*no ways\* for them to hide the FTD's

t3_x8iekm|1662589280|amcstock|Just a thought|"So am thinking about Cinemark going bankrupt and what it means for AMC!
A competitor going under is always a good thing for the remaining players.

The movie studios who now want to show their wares have one less movie theatre company to sell to, Am assuming this means AMC bargaining power has gone up because let’s face it movie studios flirting with the idea of streaming have realised releases need to be in cinema first and is where the money is. There is space for streaming and movie theatres in this industry to coexist.

AMC is well capitalised and given cash in king, I don’t see AA buying Cinemark but he may well buy up a couple of the profitable sites with high footfall.

Now a movie studio could buy Cinemark because US legislative changes now allow them to buy a movie theatre company, but this would result in other movie studios wanting a piece of the pie aswell and also own a large movie theatre company for fear of being left behind otherwise they will make movies but who will show them in a cinema environment to customers, their competitor who may buy Cinemark may not.

1.6m visiting in one day just to AMC shows appetite is there and cinemas are not going anywhere, sure the weaker players may disappear but the largest theatre company in the world with a billion in the bank and 4 million apes behind isn’t going anywhere, choke on that hedgies!

Can’t wait to see how this story ends

No one's talking about these houses how they're losing value and how when Jerome Powell raises interest rates no one will be able to afford those mortgage payments. The sad thing is he has to do it I believe the next fed meeting they're just going to freaking raise interest rates to the roof. I feel like they're just waiting for a scapegoat.

Who gets the money from the interest?

Please correct me if wrong but is it AMC that gets any interest generated through loaning out APE shares?

Is this how AA is raising a ton of cash to see AMC pay off its debts/survive the next recession?

Im guessing here, but if he knows the shorts cant cover the synthetics, then is he rinsing them for the cash generated through interest on APE shares? 

If this is the way then he has them over a barrel. Its either MOASS through closing short positions in AMC, or continually milking them for cash while they kick the can down the road through 2023,24,25...

Now that this has settled many people still don’t have ape and their is a very high ctb rate for ape. This speaks to the fact that the thesis of naked synthetic shorts is very real which we have all known for a long time. 

That said if somehow amc float wasn’t 100% sold and owned already you would get an ape share by buying an amc share since they were released 1:1 correct?. If there were unsold real shares in the dtcc they would have an ape tied in with them. The hedgies are very fucked I don’t know what AA will do from this point but it doesent take a scientist to see that ape has for sure already exposed the fact that the float is by far oversold. 

If the float wasn’t oversold everyone would have gotten ape. There is no options chain so why would anyone be borrowing ape shares unless to short which seems very stupid givin that it is a dividend share of prefered equity stock. They are borrowing shares to try to cover ape owed for naked synthetic amc  Shares is my guess or they are short selling them to attempt to delist ape which isn’t going to happen either.

t3_x7yg5u|1662534782|amcstock|Thesis: AMC and a cash dividend triggering the squeeze|"German Ape here and that is my thesis:

&amp;#x200B;

The real short squeeze has a different basis than just ""buy and hold"".

(And don't get petulant right away, I have been buying and holding AMC since January 2021).

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I am dealing with the topic of dividend stocks.

What does this have to do with AMC. I think a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to choose dividend companies, one uses completely different key figures, e.g. the growth or the constancy of the dividend payment.

Such stocks basically work differently than growth stocks. Actually, the share price is ""hardly"" interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

Most importantly, the ""attack pattern"" of SHFs does not work for dividend stocks. In fact, it is counterproductive: the price of a good-paying company declines? Ok then I buy more of it for less money which further increases my dividend yield.      

&amp;#x200B;

So AA has to pay off the debt and get a positive cash flow to be able to pay dividends again.

&amp;#x200B;

How he can do that? For example with APE. 

If AMC pays out the remaining APEs at higher prices. Yes that would be a dilution of the APE price, but basically doesn't matter if afterwards by vote the APEs are converted to AMC. So the price of APE is then no longer interesting after the dilution. One could even still buy APE/AMC at a nice low price.

&amp;#x200B;

The second important point is: Go to the cinemas and spend your money there.

In my opinion, this is even more important than buying the shares of AMC.

Let's be honest: The SHFs park our purchase requests in the dark pools and, as everyone knows, have many other methods to artificially suppress the price.

But the SHFs can't do anything against real sales and a positively developing company.

&amp;#x200B;

The fun starts as soon as AMC can pay a cash dividend!

&amp;#x200B;

Let's assume AMC starts with a dividend of 10 cents (the typical AMC dividend was 20 cents). For that, the company would have to (be able to) raise just over $51 million.

Assuming 5 billion synthetics, however, someone else would have to come up with half a billion, which would not be AMC's problem.  

If there is even so much money that AMC buys back shares and thus reduces the outstanding shares to e.g. 300 million, then they would only have to raise about 30 million dollars for such a dividend, but the SHFs still have the assumed 5 billion synthetics in circulation and diligently pay huge amounts of dividends in a market environment where money is just not so liquid anymore....

The example can be taken any further.... but I think you see my point here.

&amp;#x200B;

As always, I love criticism. So bring it on!

And then reading again and again) information and books on Wyckoffian approaches toward understanding the market environment. I am attaching my most recent analysis [here](https://imgur.com/a/jGCIRHQ)

My purpose in making this post is to encourage people to join me in trying to analyze meme stocks using the tool that is Wyckoff Analysis. My goal is to encourage regular dialogue about this such that we can learn from one another rather than falling susceptible to confirmation bias and group think bc these are bad tools and detrimental to our academic understanding of the markets. let's work together to better one another!!! 

Now, I understand that many of you already are rolling your eyes 🙄 about the application of technical analysis (in most any capacity) toward the meme stocks, but I want to provide and answer as to why technical analysis is actually an objective representation of market manipulation being put into practice. This is what Wyckoff schematics provide. They provide the psychology surrounding why it is that these events are happening. This is in contrast to blind acceptance to statements such as a ""head and shoulders"" pattern typically predict an upcoming downward move. The Wyckoff approach says that what is likely happening in a ""head and shoulders pattern is that there was likely some form of push upward followed by a buying climax (left shoulder), followed by a push downward known as the automatic reaction downward (e.g. people taking profits) which is then followed by another push up for a secondary test upward which may reach a peak known as an upthrust if we are in an overall upward general trend, and is known as an upthrust after distribution (UTAD) if we have been in a general downtrend (e.g. head formation). If it does not move any higher, this confirms the continued downtrend (distribution phase). The exception to this is in identifying whether there is a spring present which will inevitably propel the stock up from below the trading range and back into it and perhaps, even well outside of it to begin a new net accumulation phase. 

Overall, my point is that we can use this tool to predict meme runs and the more resources and people willing to participate, the better we become. Knowledge is power... EMBRACE IT!!! 

Tldr; markets are rigged, let's study patterns to predict and, more importantly, understand their motives behind their actions."|0.96|49|0|49

Also, I'm using percentages instead of prices due to discrepancies in broker charts for AMC historical pricing.*

Today we ended the day with 20,720,292 volume (source [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/)).  That's **loooooooow**.

Since Jan 2021, there are only five days with lower volume trading for AMC.  Notably, the two time periods that appear most in the 10 lowest volume days are:

&amp;#x200B;

**July 2022 Run-up of 184% jump from lowest price, low volume day (July 25)**

    • July 29 = 18M (1 day before 6-day bullish trend)
    • July 25 = 21M
    • July 26 = 21M
    • July 27 = 23M

&amp;#x200B;

**Nov 2021 Dip of -32% dip from highest price, low volume day (Nov 17)**

    • Nov 24 = 18M (1 day into 7-day bearish trend)
    • Nov 26 = 20M
    • Nov 19 = 21M
    • Nov 17 = 23M

&amp;#x200B;

Given \[a\] AMC's high short interest and cost-to-borrow data, along with \[b\] today's volume of 21M, and \[c\] the seeming consolidation in price action, it seems a high chance we may soon see a bullish trend.

But don't take my word for it or see this as financial advice.  Instead, if you're inclined, let's try this fire by accounting for additional data.

Would anyone be able to double-check the Short Interest and CTB from Ortex during these time periods above to better compare against our current situation?

**Ortex Take-aways**

Currently, AMC short data across the board is higher than July-August 2022 run-up.  It's hard not to have confirmation bias when looking at these figures; there's always a chance SHFs short the price further.  But if they do, it seems it would simply be adding more energy for a bigger jump up.  Thanks again to u/PartyAstronaut83 for the information.  I'll leave you with a quote they shared:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is kind of looking pretty similar to me as there wasn't variance in this data back in July either but I'd say things right now look even spicier with how tight everything is in comparison to July. It looks... ready to pop at any moment!  
&gt;  
&gt;I think it all depends on if this is the bottom for volume or not, also the landscape is very different now post APE. Either way the rip is coming it's just a matter of time! NFA, pry these shares from my cold dead hands hedgefuks!

The question that I have been asking myself to ask maybe all of you.

A fund. APE fund, dedicated and funded by US to research the very distructive nature of HF and its effect on the wealth of our society, how they are steling our wealth. Research by scholars, economists, lawyers and other qualified people. 

Imagine cigarettes back in the day. The resistance it took, the tobacco execs even lied to congress etc. But it was done. 

The point is. If WE act TOGETHER we have a chance to change the system. We can attack them with our fund. APE fund for market transparency &amp; market fairness.

It takes a day to set it up. And maybe a few weeks or month or two to get the right people involved into it.

Sales figures represent a 9% increase from the previous week.

A $3 movie ticket promotion meant to boost sales across cinemas during a typically sleepy weekend for the business has drawn in 8.1 million customers, according to the National Association of Theater Owners.

By those numbers, Saturday was the best day of the year for movie theater attendance, the group said.

Movie theaters pulled in $24.3 million in ticket sales from the National Cinema Day promotion, according to Comscore. The media analytics company said that was a 9% increase from the previous week.

More than 3,000 cinemas and 30,000 screens in the U.S. participated in the initiative, including major chains like AMC Entertainment and Regal Cinemas as well as independent theaters. Featured films included Paramount 's ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" Warner Bros Discovery's ""DC League of Super-Pets"" and Sony 's ""Bullet Train.""

Some theater chains offered discounts on concessions as well.

Ticket sales have fizzled in recent weeks , in part due to fewer summer releases.

The nonprofit Cinema Foundation, which is part of the National Association of Theater Owners, hoped the discount ticket initiative would incite customers to come back to theaters, especially ahead of some big releases planned for the fall, like Warner Bros. Discovery's ""Black Adam"" and Disney 's ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."""|0.96|143|0|143
t3_x6y0oh|1662429779|amcstock|Want to really help AMC’s bottom line!?? For those that don’t know keep reading ⬇️|"
How does AMC really make money? What are the real money makers? Why are Concessions so expensive? How can he help improve AMC’s bottom line? 
The two top things to help is…

- Buy anything and everything you can at the concession stand. 
- Go watch older movies that have been out for over a month. The longer they’ve been out the bigger the ticket percentage split for AMC

Some people think, “FUCK why are snacks so expensive? They make a shit ton of money already from tickets sales, this os ridiculous!” A-lot of forecasting is involved and are priced that way to be able to keep doors open. 

The truth is there’s a shit ton of expenses AMC incurs trying to get the next big movie in their theatre. There are  bids that happen between other theatres  on the movies and on top AMC pays to lease each and every single movie they get. (I know 20 years ago it was between 40-60k per film, can only imagine what it is now)

Also, 
When does a movie get the most traffic? Yes on opening weekend and it’s imperative a movie has a huge weekend because it sets the tone on the popularity of it which will in turn bring out more people to watch it. More people = more $$$ in concessions. 

The shitty part is that AMC only gets between 5-10% of ticket sales from a movie on opening weekend. The other 90-95% goes to the studios, movie stars etc. 

After opening weekend the percentage starts shifting. Next weekend can be a 15/85 split, the following 20/80 and as the movie is in the theatre for a longer period of time eventually it can be 80/20 in AMC favor. 

That being said AMC is bringing back the original Avatar on September 23rd right before the release of Avatar 2! what does this mean? Yup I’m sure the % split on this is huge on AMC favor so we can all together literally help AMC have a great quarter and imagine all the extra revenue this would create for AMC from ticket sales and concessions! 💰 💴 

Mark your calendars and let’s make the original Avatar reach numbers of a new release movie while knowing our monies of ticket sales will also go to AMC. 

If you have time during the week go visit an amc and watch an older movie to create more revenue for AMC. 

It is imperative that we still do opening weekend movies as usual to also help set records and get some free marketing on news outlets.  

Hope this helps a bit, even if it’s just one or two people that didn’t know this. 

P.S. Don’t sneak any food in and…… 
Leave no trace behind, Clean up after yourselves you Filthy Animals 🦍 🦧

First of all - I own AMC, APE and GME. And already Dr. Stranged all of them. (Got my APE Divi on CS)

I already filled out the form W8-BEN for GME, when it was the only position I had in my CS acct. I then later Dr. Stranged AMC. Now I‘m somehow not able to fill out a W8-BEN for AMC (GME is always the default company in the form when I try to fill it out for AMC) and the notification on CS still says my account is just 80% complete because some tax info is missing.

Has any EuroApe already Dr. Stranged and managed to fill out the form for both AMC and GME? Or is it sufficient to just have it filled out for GME?

Would be awesome if someone could help!

t3_x6m2pr|1662399171|amcstock|Manipulation? I Don't Think So!|"OK, we're used to seeing the MSM narrative that somehow APEs are responsible for all of the market problems these days.  Apes are this force of evil, banding together to rob Hedge Funds of their hard ""earned"" gains and bankrupt Wall Street.

One big issue with their story though,  well actually more than one but . . . . . whatever.

Do you really think that Apes, with their buy &amp; hodl mentality really have enough money at their disposal to move the millions of shares we see traded?  If you're lucky enough to be a XX,XXX holder, are you moving those shares in and out of the market multiple times a day to make some pennies?

No?  I didn't think so.  Let's ask ourselves who has the millions and billions of dollars to buy and sell massive quantities of stock on a daily basis?  Who has the capability of running all purchases on dark pools while routing all sell orders on lit exhanges?  Is that something you evil master minds are doing on a daily basis in an attempt to wreck the hedgies?

The big pop, on that ""other"" stock, when it hit $400 or so, only a handful of apes might have enough money to make the massive purchases that were seen, running those prices every higher.  The ONLY way that happened was with the full &amp; knowing participation of the funds and their algorithms that were trading back &amp; forth, perpetuating the explosive rise.  Same thing when $AMC exploded to $70+ before being slapped down.

If you get a chance to respond to one of the ludicrous MSM hit pieces on retail traders, point out to them their idiotic assumptions and rebut that nonsense.  Admit it or not, APEs are the proverbial fly on the elephant's arse when it comes to the shear volumes of shares and money required to run the crap we routinely see where a handful of meme stocks move in lockstep patterns.

Apes might be able to move the buy needle a little when they see a price rise and start adding to their positions, but MSM assumes we are this coordinated entity that somehow moves in lockstep to thawrt Wall Street.  Come on.  Apes, by definition, are incapable of the level of sophistication and coordination MSM imbues upon them.  Oooka, Oooka."|0.89|60|0|60

And these data shows that how year 2, mid term which is this year always has been choppy. However, from Oct, Nov to June, we will see strong bull rally. This podcasat is run by Josh Brown from CNBC and I believe he run $2B fund.

In this Episode, JC Parets talk about how the midterm year always has been choppy and Q2 summer is the bottom which was June for this year.

[These are different years of election cycles. 2nd, mid term year has been always choppy or flat. However after the summer in the mid year, market started to bounce.](https://preview.redd.it/2n0mohp20zl91.jpg?width=1858&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=589d008795fe94cad374e9403e40f499cc64fb85)

 Joe Terranova from CNBC and a trader and managing director at Virtus also talk about same election cycle and how we currently don't have Lemon bros. so there won't be any market crash at this time. And he exepct market ralley from Nov to June 2023 based on historical data. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdw9FsnT71o&amp;list=LL&amp;index=2&amp;t=1505s&amp;ab\_channel=TheCompound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdw9FsnT71o&amp;list=LL&amp;index=2&amp;t=1505s&amp;ab_channel=TheCompound)

Ususally, when the bear market hits, it goes down for 1-2 year and for recovery time, it takes about 1-4 years.

 In this episode, Tom Lee talks about how we will see market continues to go up throughout 2029 based on these data.

 I am sharing these data to help some people who were worried about market crash. Lots of media and news talk about market crash alot these days. But what's important is these real facts and data. Of course it might not go always right this way but we could at least understand how market behaves in certain environment espeically we have still strong job and labor market, inflations are coming down and could come down faster than we expected and companies are doing reltaively well and consuming indications are good.

Everyone talks about the things they'll buy with their tendies like lambos and houses and all that. But the money we make is also gonna buy us the most valuable commodity of all: time. After the squeeze I imagine lots of us will have enough money to significantly reduce how much work we'll have to do, maybe even never work again. (That's what *I'm* shooting for at least.)

Me, I'm gonna focus on my creative passions. Mostly that'll be writing as writing has been my love since I was little, but I also wanna use my newfound free time to expand some of my other creative interests: drawing, painting, sculpting, game design, even filmmaking. All things I've dabbled in over the years but never had time to refine simply because I don't have enough hours in the day with how much I work. AMC is gonna change all of that though: I've been waiting since March of last year and I'll keep waiting as long as it takes.

Binge watching doesn't generate the watercooler hype that weekly shows got in the cable days.  It works even less for movies.

Streaming also misses the new movie hype because you can get to it anytime... Or just forget you wanted to see it because something newer was forced into your face by the service.

Studios are just realizing again what they have lost in the push to stream everything day one.  

Box office numbers, locally, domestically and world wide feed a need to be part of something bigger. People actually want to be counted when a movie breaks a records.

Others, who don't normally attend the movies, hear about it and FOMO themselves in.

Going straight to streaming only cuts into studio profits for film, no matter how the profits are split with theaters.  Lower attendance means no hype,  o excitement and no way to pump a movie.

This is especially true for surprise hits like ""the Blair Witch Project"".  Cost almost no money to make, and turned into a movie going phenomena.  It cost $500k to produce, but made $248 mil at the box office.

Movies like that on streaming disappear out of the top 10 within a few days.  Whats sad is that they could have also been special.   But no big news coverage means nobody will find out...

TLDL:  streaming services leave money on the table by not releasing to theaters first.  On top of that, they miss out on advertising hype of successful box office numbers... Also missing on extra proceeds.  No box office accolades, means nobody cares."|0.95|63|0|63

Here is some DD on the Anatomy of a Forum Sliding Attack, Topic-Dilution, Professional Counter-Intelligence Techniques, What we can do to counter them; And..... No Picture of my Dog because the last one was removed by the mods.|"# Alright ya fucks listen up!

This post comes with a disclaimer in an effort to combat misinformation.

***disclaimer:*** *There was a lot of interesting information yesterday posted here today; Ortex guy revealed that DTC was at an all time high, cost to borrow spiking, and yours truly; (Me) published made a post that 3.4k uproots and received a quarter million views. so first of all... thank you...*

*But before I get into the details; let me make something very very clear.*

***I am NOT so egotistical as to ASSUME that my post is being covered up.***

*I am merely following up on a rather interesting coincidence please keep in mind; I do not have the time to investigate the origin of every dog post on this board today... So take what I am about to say with a grain of salt...*

*with that in mind...*

Lets get out our tin-foil hats! Because I'm going full Alex-Jones!

I bet you noticed that this board looks suspiciously simmilar to your Facebook feeds this morning. We got flooded with pictures of Puppies, cats, and even a corn-dog for some reason. And chances are one of you lovely apes posted a picture of your dog to this board to get in on the phenomenon.

If you have. First off your dog/cat/iguana/corndog is absolutely ADORABLE 😍 I love him/her and he/she/ is undeniably a good boy/girl and/or delicious!)

But I did not updoot, or comment on your post.

Why not?

Simple; because our fine wrinkly brained Apes are spending hours slaving over their sticky keyboards to publish the DD and Original Memes that this community needs!

Upvoting or commenting on that one random corndog post potentially plays into directly into the hedgie's hand **and you could be unknowingly contributing to a counter intelligence technique called TOPIC DILUTION.**

# What is Topic Dilution?

*To paraphrase this* [*Safe Net*](https://safenetforum.org/t/the-gentleperson-s-guide-to-forum-spies/30059) *article*

""Topic dilution is a **forum-sliding** technique that is very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause **'RESOURCE BURN.'** By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt the forum readers **they are effectively stopped from anything resembling any real productivity.**

If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching **and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.'**

In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. **The less informed they are, the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that the attacker desires the group to go in.**

How a sudden influx of dog pictures creates a 'Forum Slide'

*To again paraphrase this* [*Safe Net*](https://safenetforum.org/t/the-gentleperson-s-guide-to-forum-spies/30059) *article*

If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by **‘forum sliding.’** In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to ‘age.’ Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a **‘forum slide.’**

**The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist,** which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public.

To trigger a ‘forum slide’ and **‘flush’ the critical post out of public view** it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then ‘replying’ to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. **This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting ‘slides’ down the front page, and quickly out of public view.**

**Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and useless posts.** By this means, the attacker effectively keeps the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.

# Now I'm not Jealous... but...

**THIS IS HOW A FUCKING CORN DOG GETS MORE UPDOOTS THAN ME!!! 💢😡😠**

&gt;!Okay fine... I'm a little jealous...!&lt;

Now to reiterate a point from my disclaimer. I am not some salty neck-beard that is here to Karen-post because **MY** moment in the spotlight is over.

I ask that you remain mindful that It's entirely possible my post had nothing to do with todays forum-sliding attack. Or that we just slipped into **'Gossip-Mode'** simply because the markets closed today; and were just a bunch of smooth brained ape.

But potentially Hundreds of Billions of dollars are at stake here...

I assure you... **the wriggliest of corporate weasels are working tirelessly day and night** **to control the narrative!** We need to be aware of this as a community. And the be mindful that your fellow Ape, might just be a weasel.

Here's how we starve the Weasel!

* Do not feed them; If you see 'gossip posting' don't comment, don't up-doot. This keeps DD on the front page so its author can get that sweet-sweet dopamine hit form well-deserved updoots.
* If Multiple Apes are Gossip Posting with dog pictures. Start a centralized Dog Thread; Encourage others to comment with pet pictures instead of creating a separate post.
* If there is already a grand pet thread that is popular today; Comment on the pet-post to encourage the OP to move to the relevant board.
* If you feel that your DD or important post was obfuscated by form sliding; please comment below. If there is validity to your claim it may help the wrinkle brains determine if there is a pattern. (Please include the date of occurrence and as much information as possible.)
* Report fake accounts when you see them; this effectively disarms the weasel!
* Stay vigilant, stay skeptical, stay informed, and keep holding... You beautiful fucking smooth brain!

YOY profits are expected to rise 46.2 percent through FY 2025, then 7.6 percent through 2030 “according to IBISWorld, Market Research”. The Global Film Market is expected to grow from 234.91 Billion to 318.25 Billion in FY 2025. Per patron spending on Concessions is up 34.8 percent Domestically, and 21.5 percent Internationally when compared to pre pandemic (2019) spending. According to JR Research, AMC Entertainment will post sustainable numbers in FY 2023, which is why even Michael Burry knew that as long as AMC could service its debt during the pandemic it would become profitable again (interview, July 2020). It is also why the Bonds for AMC Entertainment became extremely attractive for investors.

EDIT : Link to JFK Speech 🌛

[JFK We Choose To Go To The Moon Speech](https://photos.app.goo.gl/r2YppCRWBhF7xcDX6) 

EDIT #2 : The B-314 reference... 🤔

""Section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act (Sec 314) was drafted by Congress in 2001 to allow financial institutions to work with law enforcement agencies and with each other to support the common goal of deterring money laundering and terrorist financing.  It provides financial institutions with the ability to share information with one another (under a safe harbor that offers protections from liability) to better identify and report potential money laundering or terrorist activities."" 

https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/fincen-provides-a-section-314-b-3443385/

EDIT #3 : Reference to FDR - What was FDR known for? 🧐

""During the first 100 days of the 73rd U.S. Congress, he spearheaded unprecedented federal legislative productivity. Roosevelt called for the creation of programs designed to produce relief, recovery, and reform.""

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt

EDIT # 4 : I wasn't aware of a nefarious relationship between Blackrock and Hycroft - but AA sounded pretty pissed off, lol.   😳

EDIT #5 : Fidelity Investments tweeted one word - ""Stonks."" Elon Musk tweeted the same thing when Tesla's stock went through the roof.  💎👐

I wanted some advice from this group. Since buying AMC my 2nd child was born, our secondary car gave out and we had to replace it. I've had 5 fairly major house repairs including A/C and water heater, and kitchen sink.  A few months ago we found a tumor on my dog's paw and at the same time my van (our main vehicle) needed repairs. Right now all my debts total $42k and I currently have a ceiling falling in my garage and quarter of my fence falling apart.
