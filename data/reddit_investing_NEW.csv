You may remember me from being one of if not the first to write about $SST ($15 - 37) and more recently $FAZE ($11 - $25) before the run-ups and I’m coming back to you with another asymmetric, still yet to run spac play. This one is much less riskier than the two, while providing the same if not MORE upside and therefore is my favorite yet.

$RAM is a SPAC that just recently had its extension vote and had a large number of redemptions that brought the public float down to just 2,296,058 shares. This stock also has options which makes it one of the lowest floats with options on the market and the lowest float with options and NAV protection currently. Yes even lower than the other low float NAV spacs $THCA (2.7m) and $ESSC (3.3m) which both went to $14 and $26 off gamma squeezes respectively.

$RAM is currently sitting at $10.64 with a NAV floor of $10.21 which implies a max downside of ~4% from these levels. (Arbitrage algorithms will buy the stock if it falls below the price because it can be redeemed for the $10.21 price at merger- if you take a look at the stock history you will see this kind of price action (NAV has been increasing incrementally and we are closer the merger which explains the price increase).

So the downside here is 4%. What about the upside?

Let’s put the ridiculous and unprecedented mechanics at play here when it comes to gamma into perspective.

With a float of only 2,296,058 it would take 22,961 contracts to cover the ENTIRE float. As of now, we currently have 2,655 in OI in contracts which are currently trading for intrinsic ($0.5 each), meaning it would take a volume influx of only $1,015,300 to cover 20,306 contracts needed to account for the ENTIRE FLOAT ITM.

Remember that the $10 contracts will STAY in the money and absolutely NEED to be hedged by call sellers as the floor here is $10.2.

At the $12.5 strike we have 7,298 contracts which equate to 32% of the float.

This means we are ALREADY in gamma squeeze territory and will likely see the results of hedging towards the end of the week.

If this gets more call volume, market makers will be extremely hard pressed to find shares especially in the likely event that retail buys and holds shares driving the price up alongside the increase in call volume as this catches more eyes.

The stock has barely made any waves on social media yet outside of people who follow spacs closely making it a select few aware of the float dynamics that create the unique opportunity, yet it already has a pretty built chain for its float size. Now just try to imagine if this got even a piece of volume of some of these other squeeze plays being touted here.

If this can get the (little) volume needed to claim the float or even most of it to make gamma squeeze history, I don’t know, but with a risk of 4% which is about the downside you get in a single candle 5-min candle on $BBBY and options that have exceptionally low IV I am willing to die on this hill.

This will probably be my last update on this until we see some more volume because until then the thesis will not have changed. Hopefully see you all again soon.

Disclosure: I own shares and September and October calls.

I've come across two S&amp;P indices and it seems like they are identical, with the exception that one features a 3.5% fee built in. The indices are [S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/esg/sp-global-clean-energy-index/#overview) and [S&amp;P Global Clean Energy 3.5% Decrement Index](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/esg/sp-global-clean-energy-35-decrement-index/#overview). Per the S&amp;P description:

&gt;The S&amp;P Global Clean Energy 3.5% Decrement Index seeks to measure the performance of the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index, less a fixed fee of 3.5% per year.

I'm not sure why an index maker would have the fee applied and what the use case of this would be. Generally would have thought funds apply management fees on top. 

The first one (without fee decrement) has ETFs linked to it, the second one does not seem to. I'm not sure what the uses of the decrement index are. Does anyone know? Has anyone seen this before? I'm a little puzzled! Thanks in advance!"|0.73|5|0|5

t3_xcayt1|1662984150|investing|Less Risk = Higher Returns $ (Why Volatility in Stocks Is Your Friend)|"The conventional wisdom in the investment world is that volatility in stocks means that the underlying security is risky. I'm going to break down this post in 3 sections (1: What is Volatility? 2: Why Investors view volatility as risk and 3: Why it isn't risk)

**1: What is Volatility?** 

Volatility simply means changes in stock price. So a stock price that fluctuates in value a lot is a volatile stock. If you go to Yahoo Finance and look at the 52-week difference between the highest and lowest price of the company it's usually very wide. And most of the time (Not always) it has nothing to do with the real value of the business. I mean, could you imagine that in the real estate market, each year the price of a house fluctuates by more than 50% in a given year. For example, you buy a house for $1,000,000 and next month it's worth $500,000 and the month after that it's $1.5 million. It doesn't happen because there is some bipolar (no pun intended) realtor knocking on your door every 5 minutes offering you a new price. But because it's so simple to invest in stocks and there is Mr. market coming at you with different prices 7 hours a day, 5 days a week, people will naturally be drawn to speculation. 

**Why Investors view Volatility as Risk:** 

There are plenty of articles and education sources that explain that the higher the volatility, the riskier the stock. They advice to invest in dividend stocks for the sake of it, or defensive stocks since it's 'safer'. Also, a lot of investors see constant price fluctuations as a risky investment because if they buy the stock and it fluctuates downward in the near term, the investor has an 'unrealised loss in paper value' and if they were to sell it, they would lose money. A lot of investor compare a stocks volatility with the overall market by checking their BETA score. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why Volatility Isn't Risk:** 

It isn't risk because changes in stock prices is simply the changes of opinions of investors in the marketplace and if a stock goes up say 5% in value on Monday and goes down 6% by Friday, then it has nothing to do with the intrinsic value of a business. If you learn the economics of the business and you find it's a good investment, and it's offered at a good price then chances are its a good investment. And as long as the underlying business characteristics are solid, you can take advantage of volatility when the market offers you more buying opportunities when the stock price goes lower. And if the stock price is lower and the business fundamentals are good, you have a margin of safety (reduced risk) and more growth (once market is more optimistic)."|0.53|6|0|6

t3_xc041b|1662947434|investing|Is holding foreign currency long term an investment strategy?|"I developed an investment strategy with foreign currency in my head and wondered if it was something some people already do and has a name.

If a person feels their national currency is overvalued compared to certain foreign currency, could they buy a foreign currency they feel is undervalued as an investment and just sit on it for a year or as long as they liked as a long term investment and then exchange the foreign currency back into their national currency for a profit? Of course, they will lose some to the bank or brokerage selling the foreign currency to them and when they sell the foreign currency back to the bank or brokerage. But if right about the investment thesis of their national currency being overvalued, the upside should offset those costs. Also this strategy seems much less risky than actually shorting one's national currency if the thesis is wrong.

I know normally people trade foreign exchange but I was wondering if people ever do foreign exchange as a long term investment strategy in a way I outlined or if there is an even better way to do foreign exchange as an investment strategy and without significant risk."|0.5|0|0|0

FX markets have traded as if blood was in the water for the global economy for the better part of this year. They’re right to an extent, and weighted how events have transpired this year the US equity markets have done pretty well relative to the boom in USD. 

I’d really like an expert opinion, but since 2018 US markets have generally traded above 20PE, and above 25 since 2020. Now with the rule of 20, I obviously don’t think the S&amp;P should be trading at a 12, but 5y breakevens are still well above 2, so this market seems really expensive in that light of valuation; so rationally, you know maybe put a 17.5 multiple and give it 75BP of discount for a 16.75, that by that metric, that would probably be fairly valued. With anything above it being a premium and anything below it being a discount.

So is the rule of 20 dead? The S&amp;P trades 21, so obviously that value of valuation is not being taken into account in this market. Some hedge funds have shorted this market, thinking this exact line and have been blown out of the water.

Maybe I answered my own question, but if there’s someone who is knowledgeable in equity and the history of equity in US markets, what did it? Or at least what do you think did it? In the mid 2010s that kind of drove valuations up? The dominance of tech?

I’m actually not trying to be a bear or a bull. I’m actually trying to start investing in my own personal long term equity portfolio. And as an investor, I would say value is important to me, one of the most important things to me and I have a hard time paying the multiples that the market is asking for.

t3_xbwtmt|1662938150|investing|Young guy with some questions!|"Hi everyone,

I'm currently 17 years old, and I own a (small, anywhere between $0-30k profit but generally on the lower end of that scale) business and recently took up a part-time job ($1k a month before tax). I'm trying to plan for my financial future, and as of now, I have an emergency fund ($3k) and no debt, so I want to start focusing on investing. I understand that if I start young, compound interest will have a snowballing effect, and I often hear older people regret not investing/saving for retirement earlier. Additionally, I don't have very many expenses right now, so I want to start saving ASAP. However, I have a few questions (if you just want to drop some general advice for my situation too, I'm all ears!)

1. I know that a Roth IRA has a maximum income limit of $139k. However, I don't know what my income will be right now. I seriously doubt it'll be anywhere even close to that threshold this year (I wish!!!), but in the future, what would happen if I invested in a Roth IRA but my business had a super successful year? What would happen to the money I put in the Roth IRA that was ""invalid"" because my income exceeded the limit?
2. My current understanding is that a 401k is offered by employers, whereas an IRA is purchased by individuals. My employer doesn't offer a 401k, so I assume an IRA is what I'd want for now. However, I'm trying to understand the difference is between a traditional and a Roth IRA. Is it correct to state that Roth IRA withdrawals are completely tax-free (since you pay the taxes on the initial contribution), whereas traditional IRAs are fully taxed (both taxed on the principal and the interest)? If so, wouldn't the Roth be a much better deal? The reason I'm saying that is because with a traditional IRA, you have to pay taxes on both the principal and the interest, whereas with a Roth, you only pay the taxes on the principal, since it's only taxes on money you contribute. However, since many people say that there are cases in which a traditional IRA is a better deal, I assume I'm missing something. Is there a mistake in my reasoning?
3. Should I be focusing more on straight up investments, or is retirement savings the first priority?
4. I'm pretty keep-it-simple with financial stuff; I'm not into day trading, I just want to grow as much money as reliably as possible. I read an article stating that picking investments individually is just as reliable as a monkey throwing darts at a dartboard, literally ([https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB991681622136214659](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB991681622136214659))... because of this, I want to invest 100% in index funds. However, plenty of smart people I know pick their own stocks, or invest in funds where ""stock experts"" pick their stocks for them. I assume there's some reasoning behind this - what is the logic behind this vs an index fund that tracks the S&amp;P 500?

Thanks so much everyone!

I wanted to start a discussion about [InPost](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INPST.AS?p=INPST.AS) - most likely not many people here know about this company yet as Reddit is mostly American, so here are some details &amp; my analysis. **Disclaimer**: I love the company and I am investing in InPost regardless - I am not asking for advice, just wanted to start a discussion.


InPost provides delivery services through its network of automated parcel machines as well as to-door couriers and fulfillment services to e-commerce merchants. Established in Poland in 2006, where 2/3 of online shoppers use lockers. 

So, most of their business is focused on their [parcel lockers](https://www.parcelworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/InPost-UK-Parcel-Lockers-in-situe.jpg). They are the absolute leader in this segment in Poland - over 18000 lockers in the entire country, and thanks to InPost, Poland has the largest worldwide number of automated parcel machines (APMs) per 100,000 inhabitants.

48% adults in Poland use InPost's services. 58% of them have an InPost locker within a 7-minute walk; 47% within only a 5-minute walk.

**The price** for their delivery services is about 10pln ($2), which is cheaper than traditional to-door services, although most big stores/platforms offer deliveries to InPost's parcel lockers for free.

**Competitors**: domestically mostly Orlen and Allegro, only have about 1000-2000 lockers each. Nowhere near InPost. Late to the party. Also Orlen is not trusted by the vast majority of consumers due to it being a state-owned company.

**Competitive advantage**: 

- 99% of packages are delivered on the next day,

- the number of lockers virtually everywhere in the country - in 2021 InPost had 45% of all collection points in Poland (this includes for example stores which accept deliveries as a side-business),

- contracts with major e-commerce platforms, 

- they are universally loved and trusted in the country. People generally prefer having their package delivered to a locker that's 5 minutes away than to be locked at home for the entire day awaiting the delivery. They are faster than competition as well and often deliver on weekends.

- the market for parcel lockers is not saturated in countries other than Poland, so the possibilities for growth are insane. They are capitalizing on it.

**Growth:**

- deliveries to parcel machines already account for almost 40% of all deliveries in Poland, and by 2024 this number will be equal to the market share for home deliveries. 

- almost 15.7 million people in Poland have more than 10 minutes of walk to the nearest parcel collection point or a parcel machine of any company. It means that there is still room for development and new devices and collection points in Poland.

- they are increasing their volumes even when the market goes down.  In Q1 2022 their marketshare in Poland increased by 16%. In UK, even though the market shrunk by 20%, InPost's volumes increased by 157%. In France, InPost's volumes increased by 8% while the market shrunk by 16%.

- InPost Fresh: their new service which provides grocery deliveries from supermarkets to their parcel lockers or to-door. 

- new lockers operated only through their mobile app. Cheaper to manufacture than their previous ones with large touch screens, saves energy as well. 9.6M people use their app.

- most importantly in my opinion, their plans to expand internationally. They doubled the number of their lockers in the UK this year - to 4000.  They took over Mondial Relay in France and have placed 1000 lockers so far in 9 months. According to CEO Rafał Brzoska, there is even more demand for their services in France than in Poland. They are also introducing InPost in Spain and Portugal.

- Q2 2022 was record breaking for the company. Increased income by 97.8%, EBITDA up by 41% and 73% more delivered packages. 225% more in the UK alone after introducing label-less returns. Increased marketshare in all locations despite market shrinking.


I am invested because I have used their services for a few years now, and I think they will grow to be the leader internationally as well. The share price is 6.49 EUR right now, up by 9.43% last month. Down by 57.09% since last year. I bought at 5.87 EUR."|0.46|0|0|0

I don't want to post it here because I don't want to violate the self-promotion rule, but the mods suggested that instead of linking to it, I could post all the information from the video here for discussion. Therefore, please enjoy the script and feel free to ask questions below.

**What’s The Deal With I Bonds?**

Before we begin, I want to say up front: I’m not a financial advisor. I’m going to be giving an opinion about I Bonds, but nothing here should be construed as investment advice for you specifically.

I remember a few years ago my aunt passed away, and I learned she had left me some US Savings Bonds that she bought in my name the year I was born. These were physical paper bonds, and I felt sort of sentimental when I went to cash them in, thinking of what a nice thing she had done for me, so very long ago. But, if I’m honest - while I was touched by the gesture that type of savings bond wasn’t a great investment, because the face value wasn’t much more than when she bought the bond when I was born in…let’s see…carry the two…1853. And I think a lot of people feel that way about savings bonds. They’re old fashioned. They’re not going to make you rich, right? Why bother?

Well, there is a reason to bother, and it’s because of the Series I savings bonds. First issued in 1998, for a long time these were the best kept open secret in personal finance. These are, in my opinion, one of the best investments available to normal Americans. I’m going to explain why I Bonds are so great, I’ll discuss how you can get started in them, and I’m also going to talk about some of their drawbacks.

**IT’S ALL ABOUT INFLATION**

Why do we invest? Fundamentally it’s because if you’re not investing your money somehow, you’re losing it. Inflation means that money we stick in the bank loses value over time. If you had $100,000 in 1980, and you stuffed it into a mattress, and took it out today, it would only buy a fraction of what it would have bought in 1980. In fact, you would need around $360,000 2022 dollars to buy the same amount of stuff. Inflation is real, and it eats at your savings over time.

For the past few years, we’ve had very low inflation, but now that we seem to be entering another rough spot of higher inflation, people are starting to look for solutions. Enter I Bonds.

**THE GOOD**

I Bonds, or more properly “Series I Savings Bonds”, are a low-risk savings product of the United States Department of the Treasury. Unlike most savings bonds, which give you a fixed interest rate, usually less than you’d like, over their lifetime, the I Bond is a little more complicated. It consists of a fixed rate return, plus a variable rate. The variable rate is *indexed to* the inflation rate, specifically the nonseasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index. The interest on the bond is rolled into the principal every 6 months, so you effectively get compound interest on your I Bond. And you get it for approximately zero risk, because the bond is backed by the US Treasury.

For the past number of years, the fixed rate has been roughly 0%, so we can just treat I Bonds as a bond that is just indexed to inflation. If you had bought $10,000 worth of I Bonds in 1999, they would be worth $37,608 today - much better than if you’d left it in a savings account collecting desultory bank interest rates. You might have gotten that kind of return if you invested in the stock market…but to do that, you’d have to take more risk.

This isn’t where the story ends, though. There are other things that make the I Bonds special. The Treasury sells other inflation-protected securities, such as TIPS. But unlike TIPS, I Bonds are guaranteed to not lose value. Let me dig into that a little bit.

If you buy a TIPS bond, it’s indexed to inflation. So if inflation goes up, the value of your TIPS increases; but that’s also true if we experience *deflation* \- if inflation is below 0%, the value of your TIPS bonds will go down, limited to the face value you bought them at. This isn’t true of I Bonds - they are guaranteed to always maintain at least the value they held in the prior month. So if we experience inflation, your I Bond keeps pace with it, and if we experience deflation, your I Bond - by holding its current value - effectively becomes worth *more*. It’s like a product that has multiple types of insurance built into it. They’re an insanely good deal.

**THE BAD**

So are there any drawbacks to I bonds? There are, in my opinion, a few drawbacks, all of which are a very small price to pay. 

I Bonds are a good way to save, but they’re not going to make you rich. So while I think they fill a valuable role in many people’s portfolios, if you are looking for “I bought Xerox in 1936” or ""I bought Microsoft in 1990"" returns, they’re not going to get you there.

You can only buy them on the US Treasury’s “Treasury Direct” website. This is a very 2003 web site that is somewhat painful to use. Complaints about it are legion, and there’s just no sugarcoating it - it’s pretty bad. God help you if you accidentally lock yourself out of your account. \[whispered: ASK ME HOW I KNOW\]

Thirdly, I Bonds do lock up your money for a while. You can’t redeem them for a year after you buy them, and then you pay a small penalty if you redeem them within 5 years of purchasing them. This is a manageable risk for a product that’s meant for long-term savings, but is something to plan for.

Lastly, the Treasury itself is quite aware of how good of a deal they are giving … and so you’re limited to purchasing $10,000 of I Bonds per year. You can also get an additional $5,000 of I Bonds over and above that by applying your tax refund to it. They send you a paper bond - you can convert it into electronic form, but the process is, frankly, excruciating. I’ll leave it up to you to decide whether that’s something you want to do.

So if you, like so many of us, had looked at US Savings bonds and dismissed them as being not dynamic enough for your portfolio - take another look at I Bonds, and you might find there’s more to them than you thought."|0.83|134|0|134

What would 'de-globalization' look like? What's driving this trend? Is this trend really about 'de-globalization', or is it just about de-coupling from China &amp; Russia? Arguably, China &amp; Russia have been big beneficiaries of globalization, especially China which has made itself the world's factory. If the new 'de-globalization' trend is really about de-coupling from China &amp; Russia, then they would be expected to lose from it.

We're hearing newer words beyond 'near-shoring' -- words or phrases like 'friend-shoring', etc. How can such criteria be quantified? Earnings reports and forecasts can show objective criteria like earnings, revenues, profitability, etc. But how do companies, industries, national economies demonstrate 'friendliness'? Is this a purely political and subjective term? Can it be used to influence investors? Or will the 'friend-shoring' trend be a purely regulatory effect, driven by regulations?

There have been metrics and standards created for ESG (Environmental Social Governance), and so can we expect new metrics and standards to be created for 'friendliness'? Who gets to create and set these metrics and standards? Will this be done apolitically, or will it be an entirely political exercise?

\- A house with around 20K equity

Plan 2: Keeping the house, fixing some stuff, repainting, new roof (all things that will need to be done), building my equity and maximizing value best I could. Putting some money aside in index funds for 5 years (which obviously would be less than an apartment).

I live in the UK. The first investment platform is used when I statyed investing was etoro. Etoro let me invest on the US stock exchange so I was allowed to buy etfs like VOO, VTI, etc.

I've just opened a stocks and shares ISA on another platform and I want to invest long term on that one. However, they dont list US ETFs like VOO. What they have is the ishares UK equivalent.

I've had a quick comparison to compare US ETFs with their UK counterparts, eg. XLF vs IUFS and I see that they're not too dissimilar in terms of performance (actually the UK ones tend to outperform the US ones very slightly).

My concern is regarding trading volumes. The UK ETFs have much lower volumes compared to US ones. Should I be worried? Also, since both exchanges open at different times, how do they perform so similarly since the buyers are living in different countries?

Part of me fears of missing out of the bigger US market if I was to buy UK isharsa ETFs.

Thank you all in advance."|0.62|5|0|5

t3_xa8ki8|1662762717|investing|Medium term ETF investing|"The gold standard when it comes to ETF investing seems to be buy and hold something akin to the S&amp;P 500, which guarantees that you are not going to lose money within a 20 years or so span. On the other end of the spectrum, there are day traders selling and buying frequently.

What about the middle ground? I have backtested scenarios on Excel using historical S&amp;P 500 data and it is verifiable that if you enter the market at a point substantially lower than the previous all time high, you are also almost guaranteed to not lose money, and that becomes more so the case the lower your entry point is compared to the ATH.

For example, if you entered the market in 1973, during 94.71% ATH, you would have lost 55% of your wealth by 1982. If you entered the market just two years later, in 1975 with a 47.46% ATH, you would only have lost 11% of your wealth.

So the optimal strategy for a medium term risk averse investor seems to be parking your cash on assets that yield enought to beat inflation, or slightly surpass it, and then buying all in when the market enters free fall and hits &lt;60% ATH, the lower the better. Of course, you need to search broad market ETFs unlikely to go to zero, not niche ones or individual stocks.

So I have 2 stocks I like in a particular sector that have been following for a couple years… very close in price with minor variability (talking about usually 10 cents in difference in extremes).

This results in increasing total number of shares of stock.  Then the lower priced stock will rise to within one or two cents or higher priced stock (sometimes surpass it).

Simply if the price of a company falls - then it's dividend yield rises. If the company can continue to pay it's dividends **(based on fundamental analysis)** at an increasing rate, the price will adjust to it's median. Dividend yield TTM is a ratio of share price to total payouts made over the last 12 months.

And this strategy really surprised me - today my portfolio has 68% profit with 27% IRR and 2.8% yield on cost (1.7% dividend yield based on recent prices). And it beats S&amp;P500 return by 20% for 2 years!

To be honest, AAPL makes 50% of its profits. I love this company and the way they do business. I recorded a dividend yield of 1.4% for myself.

UNH and FUN could be a better choice, as history shows. 

The next buy I think will be INTC, because only that bastard has negative returns in my portfolio and 10 year max div yield.

What do you think? Could this strategy be consistent, or it's just luck and good timing?

t3_x9fwuc|1662681459|investing|I collect coins and banknotes as a hobby. Here is why buying money with the a picture of Queen Elizabeth II on it thinking these are going to become collectables is a bad investment idea|"Over the next week or so there is going to be a wave of people passing through here with the 'unique' idea that they are going to buy some British banknotes or coins and that in just a short time its going to be a higly sought after collectable. It wont. This is a bad investment idea. Now naturally the kind of person who comes up with this get-rich-quick scheme is going to try anyway, but for the rest of us I will try and explain here why this is a bad idea.

First, let me clarify the difference between currency value and collectable value. If I get a five quid note and I pay five quid to get it, this does not mean it is a collectable. That is just how money works. For something to be collectable it has to have a value above and beyond what you would be able to use it as if you just spent it as cash. To extend this just a tiny bit more, if I got an ultra rare limited edition five quid note that is in mint condition and I pay a million quid for it, the actual colectable value is nine hundred ninty nine thousand nine hundred ninty five quid.

The next thing I need to explain is marginal value. Lets say a store was selling apples. What would be the better sale price? Half off? Or buy one get one free? At first thought this seems total nonsense. Thats the same thing! But not so fast. What if I was selling toothbrushes? Do I realy need two toothbrushes? If I got a second toothbrush, one of those is just going to be kept under the sink untill the first toothbrush wears out. I would rather just get one toothbrush only and get it for half off. This is marginal utility.

So with both of these idea in mind, lets talk about coin collecting. Say someone wants to start collecting and the first thing they try is getting all five of the ""five good emperors"". They go to a few swap meats and quickly start acquiring the set. But  Nerva  is giving them some problems. No matter where they go, they cant seem to find a  Nerva. But they keep at it and soon enough they find one for sale but its $200. Ouch! Thats above their price point for just a starting collection, but they realy want to have the whole set. So they break down and pay it. A few more months roll by and they once again find someone selling a  Nerva  and selling it for $199. I this was absolutely any other product it would be natural to think they would buy this second one also. But what about the collectable value? What about the marginal utility? Do they honestly need a second copy of the  Emperor  Nerva  coin? The series is already complete so what's the point of having it in your collection twice? Who cares if its a buck cheaper. They wouldn't even buy it to try and ""flip"" to another collector. The time and effort they would need to go to in order to flip it would bot be worth making just $1 in profit.

And that leads us finally to Queen Elizabeth II. Coins and banknotes with her likeness are not rare to begin with. Supply already way outstrips demand. But even on the demand side, collectables do not follow the regular supply-and-demand curve. Every economic textbook out there shows this graph as a smooth gently curving function. But the supply-and-demand for collectables doesn't do that. There is a hard upper limit that is the total number of people that are collectors. If the number of coins is less than the number of collectors, there will be demand. But if the number of coins is more than the number of people that are into the hobby, you do not get a slow gradual tapering off. You get a graph that drops off a cliff.

There are ancient roman coins out there that you can get even today that are just the value of the metal the coin is minted from. The collectable value that is above and buying the value of the base metal is basically zero. This is true despite the emperor depicted on the coin being dead for thousands of years. The reason they have no collectable value is ttoaly decoupled from the emperor being alive or dead. The lack of collectable value comes from the fact that the number of coins in existence is larger than the number of people in the hobby. There is enough to give all collectors at least one, and nobody cares about having a second one.

Coins and Banknotes with Queen Elizabeth II will never have a collectable value. Dont even try to buy them up now with the hope that in the future you can sell them for more. It wont happen. It cant happen. Don't even try. If you want to use this event as motivation to get into coin collecting as a hobby them have at it! Its a great pastime and I will welcome you. But if your just out to flip coins as a get rich quick scheme, then dont.

""You know Jerry, I'm not gonna tell you that this coin will increase in value, or even hold its current value. The truth is, you brought it cuz you like it. It has value to you. That's what matters"""|0.92|1525|0|1525

t3_x8zvzp|1662641927|investing|Energy Sector Investment Europe|"Hi folks, 

I'm wondering what people's opinions are about investing in energy companies at the moment? In particular, risks and the political climate. 

The UK has just announced that energy prices will be capped but the cap will not be covered by energy companies through a windfall tax. Instead, thr government will borrow to cover the costs for families. This essentially means the energy companies will be able to keep the extra profits they make. 

With the current energy prices in Europe, it seems that energy companies are in for a few years of record profits. Shell and BP have already made good gains and autumn hasn't even hit. In fact, a leaked document was exposed recently estimating that energy companies will make an extra 170 billion in profits over the next 2 years (might not be exact figures but around that). 

So from this information, it seems logical that one should be investing heavily in the energy sector since they are almost guaranteed to make record profits. However, one risk I'm weary about is the idea of energy rationing. Switzerland has already announced such measures and this will likely follow in more countries. UK has announced we will not be rationing energy but I dont know. we always say we won't join the crisis hysteria and then always end up screwed because we didn't take the crisis seriously and join in too late. 

So yeah, I wonder what people are thinking? Are the estimation of record profits enough to lean heavily into am energy focused port folio? Or are there other risks that need to be accounted for? What companies do people think will really make a killing through this energy crisis?"|0.7|4|0|4

It's really simple, if you just divide 72 by the expected rate of return, it will tell you. So for example, if you go 72/10, it will take 7.2 years to double your money. If you go 72/15, you will double your money in 4.8 years. 

What's cool about this formula is that you can also calculate the annual rate of compounded return that is required from an investment depending on how many years you expect to double your investment. So if you go 72/7.2, this will equal 10%. If you go 72/4.8, the result will be 15%."|0.91|871|0|871

I'm going to ignore ""treasury direct"" so please consider it off topic.

There seem to be two remaining popular ways to get t-bill interest rate:

1. Buy T-Bills via a retail brokerage; seems like you have to use a ""non-competitive"" bid, which is basically a blind bid with a surprise interest rate ""discount"". 
2. Buy a t-bill ETF such as SGOV

What are the upsides for parking fiat between those two methods ?

My guess is the advantages are

T-bills:

* State Tax advantages for directly owning t-bills vs getting dividends via an ETF
* No expense ratio, so you get those last few basis points
* No risk of the price dropping like mad

ETF:

* works like autopilot so you dont have to manage it
* Not having aas much downtime for your fiat pile between t-bills when they expire till the next auction
* Can sell anytime with less overhead

Most recommendations say to go with low cost funds that track the target index. For international, VXUS is frequently pointed to as a top option as it tracks the entire non-US market at a low 0.07 expense ratio. A common active option is RERGX with a 0.46 expense ratio. 

I’m curious about thoughts on active vs passive, specifically when it comes to international (non-US) equities. My thought process is that active could be beneficial for international as there are a number of bad markets that would be included in passive, but active managers could choose to exclude stocks from such markets and they would be more in the know of those markets would be. Looking at RERGX as an example, it appears that it has historically outperformed the MSCI index. Based on that, it would seem to me that active funds would be a better option as long as the expense ratio is fairly reasonable.

I’m assuming that there are key flaws in my logic due to the number of recommendations for the low expense passive index option. I’m curious what those flaws might be and what others think of this.

To save costs on fees, I'd like to switch from my robo advisor (Betterment) to Fidelity.

t3_x7yo4z|1662535603|investing|Porsche IPO is so corrupt that if it goes through, I’m never investing into German stocks again|"**TLDR**: the Porsche family is getting full control of Porsche the company literally for free. This is the main reason for the IPO. The way the IPO is structured will hurt VW and gullible investors buying into this. VW and its long-term strategy are thrown into disarray.

**TLDR (with light details):**

1. The Porsche family already owns a significant chunk of both VW and Porsche companies. But they want full control of the Porsche company.
2. They ousted the CEO of VW on a pretext and forced the IPO that benefits only them.
3. The family will get additional 25% of the Porsche, which will give them full control of the company.
4. The family is not paying a market price for 25% stake. In fact, they are not paying at all, because they forced VW to pay a dividend from the IPO proceeds, which the family will get by being a shareholder of VW.
5. Shares available to the public during the IPO are all non-voting.

**Long story**

The way the IPO is organized is a disgrace, and if the German government allows it to go through as is, I will have no faith in making long-term investments in German stocks anymore.

If this is legal under German laws, then I'm not buying. If this is illegal and they don't do anything, I'm not buying either.

To understand what and why is happening you need a little context, so here it is.

The Porsche family lost control of the Porsche company during the 2008 financial crisis. They wanted to buy VW but ended up in a weird financial situation where they instead had to give up control of Porsche to VW but got a controlling voting stake in VW.

The ownership structure is complicated, but in a simplified form it looks like this:

&gt;The family -&gt; Porsche Holdings -&gt; VW company -&gt; Porsche company

The IPO will make it look like this:

&gt;The family -&gt; Porsche Holdings -&gt; VW company (&gt;50% of voting rights)  
&gt;  
&gt;The family -&gt; Porsche Holdings -&gt; Porsche Company (&gt;50% of voting rights)

The money flow is like this:

&gt;The family “buys” 25% of voting shares from VW below market price with no competition.  
&gt;  
&gt;VW pays 50% of IPO proceeds as dividends.  
&gt;  
&gt;The family gets its money back from VW in the form of dividends.

This IPO would be a disaster even during normal times. VW is losing its best cash cow, for half the price, and the price is below market rate. But it’s happening during one of the worst times for IPOs ever. The stocks are in a global downturn, hammered by inflation, rising rates, quantitative tightening, supply chain issues, and ongoing war in Ukraine, which amplified all of the above and added energy crisis on top of that. Germany is in the worst economic situation since the fall of the Berlin wall.

This is not the right time to IPO a luxurious brand. However, this is the best time for the family to get their favorite asset out of VW. From their perspective, the less money IPO makes, the better. This conflict of interests is as bad as it gets.

IPO shares available to the public will be useless non-voting shares for gullible investors, who do not understand what they are buying. Think SNAP or GOOG. But it gets worse.

Let’s remember for a moment, that VW was not a good company for a long while. It ended up in a “diesel gate” scandal, had to pay enormous fines, as well as to change its CEO. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because VW got a good new CEO, had to reinvent itself by becoming more environmentally friendly, and thus started an early transition into EVs.

VW is already a top seller of EVs in Europe and rapidly growing its market share. It has a vast portfolio of cars ranging all segments, from the cheapest economy cars to the most luxurious ones, of which Porsche is the main brand. Platforms within VW are interchangeable, they use the same tech across multiple brands to achieve synergy.

Now, if you take Porsche out, these plans are thrown into disarray. On top of that, both Porsche and VW will have the same CEO, answering to the same family. Which company do you think he will prioritize more when it comes to that?

What’s more, the transition to EVs was not going smooth already. There are issues with software, which VW was never good at historically. And the labor unions were very unhappy at the potential loss of jobs (because you need less jobs to make EVs). The family seized on this opportunity to oust the CEO under a pretext that the software was delayed, and the labor unions supported the change to get their job guarantees.

The labor unions now expect to keep their jobs, meaning VW will have to keep combustion engine factories operating for longer for no economical reason. This is good for workers, but a disaster for investors in VW. The family got their IPO, which is good for them, but also a disaster for investors. And the new CEO has no experience in building software whatsoever with no sound plans to address the problems.

The right change for VW would be to hire an experienced executive VP from one of the major tech companies in the US and improve their software development culture. There was no need to change their CEO, especially considering that VW was transitioning to EVs better than all of its competitors. But, oh well.

**My positions:**

I owned VW stock for a while and sold at \~2x profit after the war in Ukraine started but was planning to buy back later. Now, however, if the IPO goes through, I’m not touching this stock, or any other German stocks for that matter."|0.94|2321|0|2321

t3_x7j582|1662491829|investing|Advantages of Stock Dividends over Stock Splits?|"As far as I have understood, the fundamental difference between Stock Dividends and Stock Splits comes down to:

1) Par value share remains the same for Dividends due to redistribution of profits from Retained Earnings into Common stock

2) Additional shares are taken from Authorised Reserve Shares and given to shareholders thus reducing Reserve Shares as opposed to just splitting already issued shares. 

But at the end of the day what actually changes?? The market cap stays the same for both scenarios. Even though stock dividends are presented as a ""return of profits"" to shareholders via stocks, nothing actually changed. 

The only thing I can think of is that after the stock price is accordingly adjusted, in the case of Stock Dividends the stock price is expected to continue increasing, whereas in Stock Splits it will stay at it's new lower value (until further increases in profits in the future), which in essence means that the market cap ACTUALLY will INCREASE in Stock Dividends. Indirectly at least. 


So TLDR:

SCENARIO 1) STOCK DIVIDENDS

Shares= 100
Market Share Price = 1$
Stock Dividends=100%

New Shares=200
New Market Share Price=0.5$ (Par Value same as before) 

But... New Market Share Price continues to increase as the increased profits are an attractive to signal to potential investors 



SCENARIO  2) STOCK SPLIT

Shares= 100
Market Share Price = 1$
Stock Split = 2:1

New Shares:200
Market Share Price = 0.5$(Par Value Halves)

TL;DR sob story about being lazy with rolling your 401(k)s and just leaving them with your old company.

A company I used to work for got bought by Schneider Electric a few years back. So my 401(k) is still with Schneider. I never moved it because it was Vanguard, I was happy with my money in VIIIX, and I didn't want a trad IRA balance to mess up any backdoor Roth possibilities.

Recently, and with some very negative response, Schneider decided to move from Vanguard to (I guess) Aon, who do a bunch of other fiduciary management for them. This seems like a rigged game to me, and it seemed like a rigged game to some of the investors who sued Schneider and Aon for this move - the change led to increased management fees for the entire program and higher fee funds - essentially Schneider decided to move some of their costs onto the participants of the plan (at least, I assume Aon gave them a discount on other services in exchange for managing the 401(k)). Whatever, I didn't learn any of this stuff until a few days ago.

Over the summer, and I get the notice from Vanguard that my 401(k) will move and a pretty simple fact sheet about how investments will be transferred. This came along with a ""you will get some more info about your new 401(k) before the transfer date of August 31."" At no point was there ever sent a ""here is a website/phone number/etc. to call."" There is a Schneider hotline but I am not a current employee and it's not available to me (which is fine whatever). At this point, yes, I should have rolled it into an IRA and not dealt with all this mess, but the fund being transferred into looks fine enough for now. Now, a couple weeks ago I did decide that I should make the effort, but by then (August 20 or so), I already couldn't access any information about my Vanguard account, not even a simple ""your account is on hold during this transfer of assets"" or whatever. So we are moving into week 3 of this money essentially disappearing from my sight and I'm getting annoyed.

Ultimately, is it a big deal that $70k or so that I won't draw down for another 15-20 years be accessible to me at this time? No. Am I panicked that my money is gone? Also no.

Sure it won’t have as much upside potential as traditional index ETFs like VOO and QQQ, but you won’t be missing out on as much as XYLD and QYLD, and you’d also receive the monthly dividends, which have the potential to increase in value with the natural growth of the ETF.

The bonds themselves offer a 5% coupon and I'd have to pay a 0.1% transaction fee to my broker to purchase them. \[Edit: and I'd almost certainly have to buy at well above face value, bringing the total yield to maturity closer to 3%.\] The bond funds (I have found two options, but they seem to be very similar), meanwhile, have had average distributions of 3% with a management fee of 0.25%.

I understand that, in theory, the fund will be more diversified compared to the one or two classes of bonds I might purchase directly. But, in either case, these will all be muni bonds issued in/by the same state, so the returns seem like they will still be highly correlated even if the fund holds a large basket of individual issues. And the state has excellent bond ratings across the board, runs a substantial budget surplus, etc., so the risk in investing in, for example, state general obligation bonds seems very low.

t3_x672vx|1662352749|investing|Any ETF that can maintain decent income without losing NAV as QYLD seems to be doing?|" As of writing QYLD dropped to \~16 dollars per share and inflation is rising. Some commentators pointed out that there are scarse mechanisms for it to rebound back, so it is basically a depreciating asset, unless the managers change the fund's strategy.

The Compound Annual Growth Rate of the S&amp;P 500 since 1871 is 7.14%, if adjusted for inflation, and 11.00% if not. If considering ever since 1950, we would have 9.46% adjusted for inflation, and 11.76% without accounting for it. This to me signifies the best performance you can get with any ETF in the longest timespan, and any decrease in risk will detract from these values.

If you simply follow the 4% rule on the S&amp;P 400, you would have an investment that at the very least is unlikely to eat away the principal, and might incur in profits if you are in a bull run. If 4% is our minimum and 7 to 9% is our maximum, it would stand to reason that the best a covered call ETF focused on income could ever do would be to yield more than 4 and less than 9 percent in dividends per year while still maintaining its principal, basically sacrificing future growth for present income.

Should stock exchanges still have hours and be closed on holidays?   
It made sense for them to have working hours and holiday's off when the majority of trading was done on the floor and, of course, those guys had to go home and eat at some point. However, nowadays, it's reported that over 85% of trades are done electronically. On top of that, many institutions have their trading plans automated and not even executed by humans. When it comes to retail investors, the case is that everybody is trading electronically or have their money in a fund that in turn trades electronically for them.

So in this current state of affairs, should trading still be restricted to only 6 hours a day and completely closed on weekends and holidays?

Seeing, also, how most people are at work during the market open, it would be easier for them to trade at later hours after they come home from work. Another argument can be that trading is global now, and if you live several time zones from New York, like in Hawaii for example, you'd have to wake up at 3am just to catch the opening bell. That hardly seems fair and it doesn't represent even ground for everybody involved.

a) Buying leaps (1 or 2 yr out) to counteract the shares I sold shouldn’t trigger a wash sale, correct?

t3_x5jy7r|1662288140|investing|Is levered bond fund the best play right now?|"Background: 

Currently the market is pricing 3.4% rate fed funds rate by Jan 2023. Although it is likely that we will see more hikes because as many will rightly point out, if history were to be a guide, inflation persists until the fed funds rate matches the rate of inflation. The flip side of the argument is the previous instances of inflation were mostly demand pull inflation and not supply side inflation, therefore a less aggressive hike is needed.
In any case, 3.4% is not far off from the long term average rate of 4% rate that the Fed has used

How it applies investing:

My fav investment right now is NBB - Nuveen Taxable Municipal Income Fund. It’s a close end fund that uses leverage. Historically, default rate of muni bonds was 0.1% per year, and NBB is currently offering 7.4% yield. That’s a whole lot of return for very little risk.
Some pimco funds, like PDI and PDO have very diversified (but leveraged) bonds portfolio and with the current hammering of the bond market they offer as much as 12% yield and PDI has a good track record too. Checking on cefdata we can see they never paid out ROC (none of the funds I’ll mention do) and CEFconnect shows that there is no NAV erosion too. Of course NAV is bound to fluctuate with interest rates, but I see no evidence of long term erosion in NBB or PDI. My point is - I don’t see this is yield chasing, I see this as a very attractive deal

Conclusion:

Leveraged bond funds with solid track record offer great returns right now. The biggest risk is further NAV decline if fed funds rate exceeds current expectations but as well we can see, implied rate is not too far off the long term fed funds average therefore with some patience these investments are bound to be profitable. If we see a fed pivot, these investments will bring capital appreciation while also you will be able to lock in attractive YOC

If I Game Theory out the market, it seems likely that energy costs will remain elevated until the end of the year, and since unemployment is currently low, I believe the Fed will at the very least raise interest rates another 50 basis points. 

The question becomes that if unemployment increases, our country sinks into the anticipated recession will the Fed reverse course, or if inflation persists, will it keep raising. I'm in the camp of the Fed suspending rate hikes in the situation unemployment increases significantly or we enter into a recession but I'm interested in hearing your thoughts."|0.19|0|0|0
t3_x5g1po|1662273373|investing|Why IPO is a really bad time to invest in a company?|"The opportunity to become a small owner of our favorite companies feel irresistible. I want to share my thoughts on why investing in IPOs is generally a bad idea. What got me thinking was IPO of Amplitude in 2021. It's a product I really like and believe in its future potential. I was rooting for the company when it went public and seriously considered buying it.

But buying the company’s stock on the IPO day would have been a mistake. It’s stock price has fallen by more than 72% in less than 12 months. I am not arriving at this conclusion by looking at just this one example. Instead, I think that as a principle it’s never a good idea to invest in a business at its IPO, how much ever one likes the company or is optimistic about its future.

Amplitude is not alone. 2021 was the year of some amazing tech companies going public. One could sense that the valuations seemed a little high, but there was optimism and confidence in the air about the potential of these innovative businesses. In the US, beloved consumer tech companies like  Doordash, Affirm, Allbirds, Duolingo, Robinhood and sturdy SaaS companies like Snowflake, Braze, Squarespace and UI Path were among many others that opened its doors to retail investors.

However, just like Amplitude’s stock price, the stock prices of many of  these companies have crashed by 70-90% within a year. While one can always attribute the crash to broad market correction, I want to reason that it is a pretty standard pattern rather than an anomaly. This is not to say that these business don’t have solid fundamentals or a bright future. It’s just that buying it on the day it goes public is not the best idea.

**So why is investing in an IPO such a bad idea?**

I want to share two main reasons for this. Understanding and registering them as mental models can help us make better investment decisions and save a ton of money in the future.

**Reason 1: It’s an unfair trade and you are on the losing end**

Let’s take a step back and see what really happens when a company goes public.

The company would have been started 5-10 years back by a few co-founders who devoted every waking hour of their life and overcame extreme odds to get their startup to this place. They hired a group of very talented  people who chose to forgo comfort in cushy jobs at large stable companies to toil along with founders for many years. The founders were backed by a number of Investors at different stages, ranging from Seed investors to VCs to private equity firms. The IPO is their payday, and they all waited for years for this moment. The higher the valuation of the company at IPO, the more money every single stakeholder - investors,  founders, and employees - will make.

These are extremely smart folks who understand their business in and out. They know what’s the fair value of the company and what’s the maximum they can get. They even hire bunch of investment bankers to justify sky-high valuation, and then beef it up some more. They have the skills and every incentive to stretch the valuation in every possible way, even if it looks borderline insane. It matters less to them how the stock perform in the future after 5 or 10 years. These folks want to cash out now.

And now think about where you stand in this transaction. You don’t understand the business as well as these insiders do. You don’t have any information about the prospects of the company. And you neither have the capability, time, or the interest to dig into the financials of the business or the industry it operates in. All you know is that you just like the  product, have heard good things about the company, or are generally optimistic about the space it is in.

Think about the information asymmetry here.

Now remember the context that all of it’s likely happening at the peak of a bull run. The companies always choose such a time to go public. It’s Euphoria all around, there is a excitement in the air, and you have a fear of missing out because everyone around you is talking about IPOs. Everything sells in these conditions and everything can be justified, especially unreasonable valuations.

So to sum up, you come to the buying table to purchase shares of a company. On the other side of the table are extremely smart and sophisticated people who have all the information about the company,  deep incentives to sell at maximum possible price, and the power to set the price. You on the other hand are intoxicated by rising markets and barely know anything about the business you are buying shares of. The stakes are high. You are literally putting your financial future on the line with your hard earned money.

This is not a fair trade by any means.

The only option you have is to get up from the negotiation table and leave. And that’s exactly what you should do.

**Reason 2: The opportunity to buy a good company isn’t going anywhere**

You can make a counter-argument at this point that great companies like  Amazon, Google, Netflix, and Meta have gone on to grow exponentially after their IPO. You would be right, but there are two things to consider here.

First, there is a bit of a selection bias at play. There are many companies that became public with a lot of fanfare, but delivered flat or no growth since then. Consider Dropbox, the once darling of the tech industry. Even after 4 years since its IPO in 2018, it did not deliver any returns to investors. In fact, it lost about 25% value in this time period. Most stocks end up in this zone of value destruction. Companies like Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta and truly the exception.

Second, and more importantly, its vital to remember that a business is great because it stays great for a very long time. It proves itself over and over again with growing earnings and market domination. And the volatile market provides many opportunities to invest in at attractive valuations.

Take the example of Alphabet (Google). It went public in Aug 2004 at $2.71 per share based on today’s stock price (original price was $85). Five years after it’s IPO, it was trading at about $11.5 per share. Today the stock trades at about $110 and has delivered a total return on 22% CAGR since going public. If you had invested in the stock in 2008, five  years after it’s IPO, the price would have grown by 10x. Or to put it another way, 90% of growth in value started happening five years after the IPO. Alphabet, like Amazon, Apple, or Microsoft, proved itself over time. And the patient investors got multiple chances to buy the stock at a fair valuation.

The same argument goes for more traditional companies. Warren Buffet invested in Coca Cola 70 years after it’s IPO, and still went onto benefit massively from stock’s growth.

And even if you feel that a company like Doordash or UIPath is going to be hugely valuable in future, now in 2022 is any day a better time to buy those stocks than a year back when they went public. You can now buy the same stock for 65-80% discount if you waited for some more time and get a much better upside.

**So what does this mean for the long-term investor?**

The reason we rush to invest when a company goes public is because we don’t have the right mental models and we can’t manage our emotions when animal spirits run high. But if we stop to think about it, it’s not hard to reason why IPOs are perhaps a bad time to invest in a company. You have major asymmetries working against you, you are too influenced to make the right decision, and if you indeed want to buy the stock, there will be much better buying opportunities in near future if you wait just a little bit longer.

Let the company prove itself for some time and start trading at reasonable valuations. Then when the  noise is filtered out and you have a clearer mind, chances are that you will take a much better decision."|0.87|278|0|278

**The Other Doomsday Scenario Looming Over Markets**

*A U.K. fund manager says the big worry isn’t inflation, it’s the Fed reversing quantitative easing*

By James Mackintosh on Sept. 3, 2022 10:00 am ET

Think inflation is the biggest threat to your investments? Perhaps not: One fund manager that successfully navigated the past two major stock crashes is bracing for an awful end to the year because it fears the Federal Reserve’s quiet exit from bonds.

London-based Ruffer LLP is concerned that the accelerating runoff of the Fed’s Treasury holdings will suck liquidity out of the markets—just as rising rates and falling stock and bond prices increase the need for cash to smooth the drop.

“It puts a pincer on equities and bonds at the same time,” said Alex Lennard, investment director at Ruffer. It could be “the sort of event you tell the grandchildren about.”

Ruffer is far from the only investor growing queasy at the prospect of the Fed’s quantitative tightening, which is reversing the huge growth in the central bank’s balance sheet since quantitative easing began in 2008. 

But it is perhaps the most surprising. Ruffer, which runs money for institutions and private investors, spent much of the past decade prepping for inflation by accumulating a massive holding in the longest-dated inflation-linked bonds available, 50-year debt issued by the British government. Now it is holding 40% of its assets in cash and equivalents, an investment that cannot keep up with inflation.

Ruffer has a decent record when it comes to crises: Its funds barely dropped in the 2020 lockdown that took stocks down by a third, and made money as markets plunged in 2008-09. But it has underperformed in bull markets.

The Fed doubles the pace of its bond runoff this month, aiming to reduce its Treasury holdings by $60 billion and its mortgage-backed securities by $35 billion monthly. Those concerned about the impact include hedge fund giant Bridgewater, which thinks markets will fall into a “liquidity hole” as a result. 

Bank of America equity strategist Savita Subramanian says QT alone could lead to a 7% stock price drop as the boost from QE is reversed. Steven Major, global head of fixed-income research at HSBC, thinks the interaction of QT and the plumbing of the financial system is too complex for anyone to predict properly. “The truth of it is that no one really knows,” he says, including the Fed.

The last time QT was tried, under Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, now Treasury secretary, it went perfectly—until it suddenly didn’t. Ms. Yellen said the predictable pace of balance-sheet reduction starting in 2017 should be “like watching paint dry,” and for two years it was. Then in 2019 the overnight lending market—crucial to the financial system and reliant on plentiful reserves—seized up, forcing an emergency rescue to prevent a full-on credit crunch.

QT is a bit different this time, the main reason that Ruffer is so fearful. Before we get into it, a quick reminder on central bank reserves for those who haven’t delved into the monetary system for a while. The Fed creates reserves as a special form of dollars that can only be held by banks and some similar firms, that they use to settle debts to each other. (The rest of us mostly use bank-created electronic money, plus physical dollars.) Since QE began, reserves have ballooned as the Fed created reserves to buy bonds from banks.

Unlike in 2017, large quantities of reserves have been returned to the central bank via money-market funds. These funds, which savers use as a liquid alternative to savings accounts, are allowed to deposit money at the Fed overnight using reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs), and have already sucked $2.2 trillion of reserves out of the system, up from zero at the start of last year.

For now, the loss of reserves isn’t a problem. Banks had too many deposits and reserves anyway, and they still have $3.3 trillion of reserves, more than they had ever held until last year. But there are risks.

Ruffer’s concern is that the loss of reserves will impede the banks’ willingness to take risks. That doesn’t matter too much when markets are calm, but, to put it mildly, they aren’t. Ruffer expects widespread withdrawals from fund managers after the terrible year they’ve had, forcing sales of stocks and bonds. If banks are constrained and unwilling to deploy money, they won’t cushion price declines and markets could drop suddenly.

A wonkier concern is that the loss of reserves to money-market funds will drain the banks so much that their reserve levels approach the minimum the Fed thinks is needed to avoid a repeat of the 2019 breakdown. Deutsche Bank strategist Tim Wessel argued in a recent note that the Fed would probably stop QT when the banks have $2.5 trillion of reserves. 

If money-market funds keep grabbing deposits and parking them with the Fed’s reverse repo facility, that could be reached as soon as January, he says—forcing the Fed into an embarrassing early end to QT. As an alternative, it could cut the rate it offers money-market funds to try to shift money back to bank deposits instead.

Where this stops being wonky is that an early end to QT would mean higher rates would be needed for the Fed to tighten policy the same amount, something sure to hit stocks.

The problem with these risks is that they’re real, but it’s impossible to say if or when they will hit. I don’t have enough confidence that trouble is so imminent that investors need to go heavily into cash the way Ruffer has. There are enough other issues—especially the market’s failure to prepare for weaker earnings next year—to keep me bearish on stocks, but inflation makes cash an expensive place to hide. Still, QT is a risk to watch closely, because it’s only boring until it suddenly isn’t."|0.76|60|0|60

t3_x519n9|1662229661|investing|Am I missing something? Real Estate Question|"A big house on my street has been split into two separate homes, the ground floor belongs to one homeowner and the second floor/attic belongs to the second homeowner. I assume that the owner could not sell the house for 400k due to the neighborhood's condition and young people looking to buy a house have too much debt to purchase the house as a whole.

[The ground floor](https://cloud.funda.nl/valentina_media/161/970/032_2160.jpg) house sells for 270k. This price seems overpriced still, firstly due to the location which has complete houses selling for the same amount. Secondly, because of the neighborhood which appears 'poor', Thirdly, the owner will always have to 'share' his house. - The house has some benefits though, the ground floor is quite spacious and [the garden](https://cloud.funda.nl/valentina_media/161/970/044_2160.jpg) is big and includes a swimming pool.

The second floor/attic sells for merely 130k, which only provides these two floors.

I was thinking: if I buy the second floor/attic for an extremely low amount(120k), would this not automatically devalue the worth of the ground floor(270k)? It is a big old house, therefore I assume the place to be noisy, and that whoever decides to live on the ground floor will suffer from hearing footsteps/other sources of noise. I could be a terrible neighbor, and besides that... as mentioned before, even though the house is very spacious and looks quite beautiful, I don't see anyone buying it for the price of a stand-alone house.

I have no experience buying a home, but am I missing something? I think if I buy the second floor for 120k, I will one day be able to purchase the ground floor for 200kor even 150k and own a big house in a mediocre neighborhood for cheap...

The company has offered me $11,250.00 to buy out the rights to it. This would mean that after 22 months I will break even (this is Return On Investment?).

If investors flee equities because they want to lock in bonds/treasuries as they become more attractive (due to rising interest rates) or because they find equities with shrinking earnings less attractive, P/E ratios could fall below 20x (which is historically relatively high/inflated) causing for even more pain on the price side of the ratio.

With that said, if Q3 2022 EPS estimates are literally perfect and P/E ratio stays 20x, we'll end up at $3824.60

By Q3 2023, if EPS estimates are again perfect and P/E ratio stays unchanged, we'll end up at $4155.60

That'd be 8.65% return in 12 months, which is about inline with what equities do historically.

tl;dr 3763-3824 could be on the horizon, followed by the typical 8-10% return equities usually see as earnings grow and get returned to shareholders through price appreciation"|0.6|2|0|2

t3_x4vjlm|1662214745|investing|Is it a good idea to invest long term with loans?|"Say you have an income of 5000$ per month after taxes, and you wanted to save up enough money to retire as soon as possible.

You live in a low cost of living country, with an expected cost of about 1500$ per month to live large and 500$ per month to live a frivolous life, you decide to live large with 1500$ and place 500$ every month into an emergency fund.

You intend on staying invested until you reached your goal of $1.2M, after which you will apply FIRE with the vanguard withdrawal strategy (take 2.5% of you portfolio on bad years and 5% on good years), you estimate this will be more than enough to live a privileged life.

You decide to save up $3000 of your income per month to work towards that goal, which will be invested in a 100% stocks portfolio of MSCI world index and MSCI emerging markets, expecting a conservative 7% per year return.

With this plan, one could expect to reach their retirement goal in 17 years, not bad.

But here i want to introduce the loan aspect of the plan. In your residence county, you can take a financing loan with a 1.1% interest rate and you decide to get some leverage.

Instead of investing the $3000 per month, you decide to take a $450k dollars loan against them, to be paid back in 13 years.
During those years, you keep the $450k invested in the same investment, which will make you have your 1.2M, saving you 4 years of work, quite the save!

However you notice a problem, what would happen if you lost your job for multiple months? This is where the cost of living would kick in, the plan is to cut down on expenses, living on $500 per month, and using the emergency fund to survive while you look for a job. You are confident you can find a job that pays at least as much as your previous one, since you're a professional in a highly requested field. As an ultimate backup plan, you're willing to sell some of your shares to give yourself extra time to find a job in case of a critical failure. You would still have a better prospect than the 4 extra years of work.

What do you think about this plan? I've also heard about the possibility of an insurance plan in case of a job loss, which should add about 144$ to monthly expenses, i would take that out of the emergency fund.

Another thing to be considered is that rather than losing my job, I expect my income to severely increase over the following years, because of my obsession with finance, a strong trend of increased income over the past few years and some personal projects that I expect to double or triple my income in the next year.

I've also read that leveraging your investments early in life is a good idea as you have a larger margin of error thanks to time and expected increase in income, and given the fact that I'm 22, I should be in rage to receive those risk benefits

The current market earnings situation.|"Even at these seemingly depressed levels (note: depressed from one of the fastest, most hysteric market runups ever), I still find the market to be on the higher end of fair value. TTM PE is finally touching below 20, but this is in the wake of extremely fast growth in earnings over the past couple years.

I'm not going to take the silly approach of counting our current growth starting conveniently at the catastrophically depressed levels of covid. Pre-covid, we were looking at about $160 eps on the S&amp;P at the start of 2020. Now we're at just a tad over $200. So you're talking 25% real growth in about 2.5 years, or about 10% real growth per year.

While the current growth number is fantastic just on its face, I hardly see it as sustainable, nor do I want to participate in pricing shares according to such unsustainable growth levels. However, it seems the market is finally turning *away* from pricing in growth, thanks to the fed. Now, despite the current price ratios becoming depressed due to upside earnings volatility, do I think it's foolish to buy in here? Absolutely not. I just don't particularly think it's time for a *heavy* allocation. I like to refer to Graham's counsel in the early 70s, since the bond/stock situation seems somewhat similar, albeit the numbers are different.

&gt;The major change since 1964 has been the rise in interest rates on first-grade bonds to record high levels, although there has since been a considerable recovery from the lowest prices of 1970. The obtainable return on good corporate issues is now about 7 1⁄2% and even more against 4 1⁄2% in 1964. In the meantime the dividend return on DJIA-type stocks had a fair advance also during the market decline of 1969–70, but as we write (with “the Dow” at 900) it is less than 3.5%...

During that time, you had a high grade corporate bond yield of 7.5% against a dividend yield of 3.5% on stocks, with bonds yielding over twice what stocks did. Now, you've got a stock yield of 1.5% against a 20y corporate AAA rate of 4.5%, or *triple* the yield of stocks. Even T-bills themselves, currently at 3%, are doubling stock yields. Graham's 50-50 counsel in that particular bond-stock situation in the early 70s appears therefore a heavier allocation toward stocks than what would be prudent at current levels, given that the bond yield:stock yield ratio is currently substantially more in favor of bonds.

But why would I say this, with the *current* growth rate of stocks being what it is? Well it's just that word -- current. Real earnings growth in the past 3 years has exploded when compared to the more smoothed growth rate over a longer time period of, say, the past 10 years. From 2012-2022, earnings have risen 112 --&gt; 204 eps. This is just a tad over a 6%/yr real rate of growth (mind you, the *price growth* of the S&amp;P over the same time period has been well over double that). Again, for this 3 year period we are currently in, we've seen something closer to 10% real growth. While in theory this is a fantastic development for those *already in* stocks, it spells caution for those *looking to enter into stocks* right at the present moment, since these periods of explosive growth are likely to be tempered by a following period of lower growth.

While the typical counsel for those in their younger years is an all-in equity approach, I think the current situation does present at least a reasonable case for consideration of a more balanced approach. At least until equities are at substantively cheaper valuations, and while short term risk free rates remain as high as they currently are (as of today, 3% on 3 month T bills), Graham's 50-50 approach seems still a prudent approach to today's current market environment. Given that the average yearly earnings of the S&amp;P over the past decade is 156 eps, an S&amp;P level of around 3120 could be considered a reasonable allocation changer (say, 50% to 75%) for a more value-inclined investor. 2340 would be the level for the die-hard Shiller believers. I find it also a strange coincidence that the Shiller level is within a few % of where the covid market bottomed out, but that is a digression.

For the most extremely conservative among us, especially those in retirement, a case could also be made even for a 25/75 portfolio. It's also worth noting that there is optionality here. With current treasury rates providing relatively little extra % yield for additional time commited, staying in the T bill range (1-3 months) allows an investor to potentially change allocations on a quarterly (even up to a monthly) basis, if stock prices happen to substantially change."|0.73|12|0|12

Unemployment rises to 3.7%.|"Hiring slowed sharply in August but remained sturdy as employers added 315,000 jobs despite softer consumer spending gains, rising interest rates and a sputtering economy.

The unemployment rate rose from 3.5% to 3.7%, the Labor Department said Friday.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated that 300,000 jobs were added last month.

Many experts reckoned August finally would mark the start of a slowdown in payroll growth after the U.S. recovered all 22 million jobs wiped out in the pandemic the prior month. So far this year, the labor market has averaged more than 450,000 monthly payroll gains, shrugging off a shrinking economy, soaring inflation, and mounting recession fears.

Persistent labor shortages have made many companies reluctant to cut staffers and even encouraged some firms to bring on workers they don’t need in the current wobbly economy with an eye toward an eventual rebound.

And some industries, like restaurants and bars, are still well below their pre-COVID employment levels and struggling to catch up as Americans resume dining out, traveling and other activities in larger numbers. For now, the robust job numbers mean more household income and spending, insulating the economy from a recession, at least in the short term.

But most employees who were laid off in spring 2020 have been rehired, leaving less space for outsize employment gains. Also, aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes to fight inflation have been expected to eventually dampen business hiring and investment.

The company that I work for doesn't offer pensions anymore (as most companies).  However, they used to.  I have many coworkers that have been there for a long time that have pensions.  Several are in their mid 50's but planned to work for a few more years.  They all learned within the last month that the value of their pension lump sum amount has declined by about 25% this past year because of the rising rates.  And apparently it resets every year.  So the boat that they have found themselves in, is they can retire by December of this year and lock in their lump sums before everything resets.  If they wait, their lump sums drop significantly and could get a lot worse of rates keep going up.  They have all met with financial advisors and found out that this is happening.  And its happening to everyone that is in a private pension program and has a lump sum option.  I found a few articles on line about this from CNBC and Forbes, so its definitely happening.  This is a really under reported story in my opinion.  Especially since we already have a labor shortage.  I don't know how many people nation wide are in this camp, but it seems like we are about to have a ton of people drop out of the work force in a couple months.

I’m leaning toward QQQ but looking at annual returns it almost never beats AAPL. In fact it seems like almost every one I look at underperforms when compared to Apple. I’m realizing I’m kinda married to this stock and it’s hard to let it go for anything that doesn’t perform as well. Also because of their behemoth size, many (most) of the major ETF’s I look at are already heavily weighted in Apple so it’s hard to feel like I’m really diversifying. I suppose one advantage would be that hopefully the ETF would be automatically rebalanced if apple ever had a sudden downturn. And perhaps rebalanced to more bonds in a major market-wide downturn although I’m not sure that would happen with something like QQQ.

t3_x34dd6|1662029167|investing|Mortgage vs Inflation vs Bonds|"The situation is this: I have a rental property with a fixed rate of 2,5%. I put 20% down and up to now paid off about 20% of the loan.

Up until March this year I contributed extra money every month to pay off the loan a little earlier because I hate having a mortgage hanging over my head even if it is a rental property.

With inflation rising, it is foolish to contribute extra money to pay off the loan, so I am thinking of doing something smarter. The question is what?

It needs to be something with low risk, I would not invest in stocks because I am already heavily invested in SP500 and all-world ETFs.

My initial idea was to invest in short-term bonds 1-3 years to maturity as they are yielding 3-3,5% ATM. However, (as I understand it) I cannot buy single bonds, only ETFs. The price of the bond ETF fluctuates and it's not like I buy a bond and hold it to maturity. The same reasoning is with TIPS.

I feel that I should somehow exploit this situation of a low mortgage rate and high inflation environment but am unsure what to do.

Do you guys have any suggestions? What are your thoughts?

EDIT:

Just wanted to thank everyone for their time and wonderful advice. After reading your thoughts my conclusions can summarized as follows:

1. Mathematically, paying down a 2,5% loan is not the optimal use of my money. Psychologically it does make a difference, and ultimately it is never a ""bad"" idea to reduce debt. 
2. For the time being, I am ruling out ibonds due to the fact I am an EU citizen, and the availability, mechanism, and taxes of buying US ibonds is not something I am comfortable with. Another problem is the currency risk for a ""safe"" asset.
3. My final decision is to wait a bit more and see if short-term securities (0-2 years) will reach a level of 4-5%. Then I will invest in said securities as I have the chance to buy such US government bonds that are hedged to my own currency (EUR). As such bonds are currently yielding 3-3,5% I will just continue to pay down debt as the yield is still quite close to my mortgage. As I said, it might not be the optimal choice mathematically but psychologically I think it is better for me at least until yields increase.

There wouldn't be a restriction on how much a construction company could charge for the first time sale of a house. So they can sell the house at whatever markup they want.

The original offer was a 2 year convertible note with 20% interest and a 20% discount on a 7mm valuation cap. 

Now the new round of equity is offering a 2 year note with no discount and no interest but a 3.5mm valuation. 

Hypothetically let's put 10k into each. 

Deal 1 would give $12,000 worth of stock at a 20% discount from valuation. (if it reached its max valuation of 7mm the 20% discount would mean I own 12k of 5.6mm?) =0.0021%

Deal 2 would give 10k of stock with the full 3.5mm valuation. =0.0028%

From my point of view it appears deal 2 is the better offer of the two. What are your thoughts?

I am very much afraid that I may be wrong, so I wanted to poll everyone else and get their input. (And yes I know people can just look at my post history to see what side of the argument I am on, but I will try and present the choices objectively.)

**A blue chip stock is 'too big to fail' regardless of its age.**

* The theory is that it will be around for a long time in the future simply do to the fact of its enormous size and so much of the economy being dependent on it. The amount of time it has existed in the past is irrelevant. It could very well be a new company that haven't weathered any major bear markets yet. Examples would be Tesla or Facebook

**A blue chip stock is old regardless of its market cap.**

* Again, the theory is that this will be around a long time in the future. But the reason is because it has been around for a long time in the past. It has lived through bear market after bear market after bear market and just simply refuses to die. The overall size and market cap does not factor in. Examples would be Hormel Foods or Emerson Electric.

**A blue chip stock is just fucking expensive.**

* Here, the future longevity is beside the point. The word origin comes from a bit of folklore where a traded back in the 1920s was looking at ticker tape and made an offhand comment about realy giant numbers being shown in the print. In poker, the ""blue chips"" have the highest value so likewise the stocks that are ""blue chips"" have the largest per share price. Could be an old company or new. Could be a big company or small. Examples would be Berkshire.A or Chipotle.

Is there an instrument that can target specific regions or value brackets? Ideally, it would be relatively low overhead but only hedge against catastrophic drops - basically a rotating covered short for my home, that becomes ITM at e.g. 20% or worse decline in value over one year.

**Edit:** A lot of comments are asking *why* I'd want to do this - it's because I'm planning on moving. But because few sellers are accepting offers with sale contingencies, there may be an overlap period during which I retain an interest in both houses, and the affordability of the new home is dependent on the value of my current home. If prices crash before I'm able to sell my current home, I would not be able to afford either one. I'm already in a position where over 80% of my net worth is in the value of my home; during the overlap period, over 100% of my net worth will be in real estate. I'd like to offset some of that risk."|0.85|258|0|258

t3_x1po59|1661881990|investing|The common stock market sayings and what they (actually) mean|"Stock market is insanely complex and sometimes to make sense of it, we use quotes/sayings/adages - the issue that I have with them is that they're often misused and other times don't make sense to begin with. I'll write some that tick me off the most, and would love to see if there are any other contributions 

&amp;#x200B;

""Don't time the market"" - or some such variation of it. One of the most common sayings, and has a lot of truth to it, however often misused in a way that ""you can never know anything"". That's not true. The quote is a lesson for chartists/technical traders, If you have a bullish outlook on the sp500, you shouldn't trade it on the daily basis and try to time every dip and peak - that's not a good strategy, buy and hold. However, **REFUSING TO BUY SP500 WHEN YOU HAVE HIGH VALUATIONS IS NOT** timing the market. And yet I see this so much, someone will mention that they don't want to buy SPY yet and want to wait longer only to get bombarded with replies ""don't time the market"". Relationship between the price you pay and your expected returns has nothing to do with market timing, sometimes it's just common sense

""Past performance is not indicative of future results"" - of course it is. Things are not totally random, at the end of the day irrationality is mostly temporary. If you have a company with sky high valuations that are nonsensical, while I wouldn't recommend shorting it (which would be timing the market) - it's sky high valuations very much do indicate that the price is highly likely to down. Same applies to whole markets/indexes. A decade of lackluster equity returns is very likely to very succeeded by a decade of high equity returns and vice versa 

""Stock market is not the economy"" - what is it then? The economy is made up of the same companies that make up the stock market. I think this one arises by the fact that people don't always grasp how pricing works. When you see economic data, it's backwards looking, market prices future outlook. If the interest rate rises or the gdp data comes out negative it does not mean the market will fall down, it will fall down if it comes out *worse than expected.* Similarly, you can see rallies during harsh economic times because the data came out *better than expected*

""It's not a loss until you sell"" - This is an actively harmful saying that should be very discouraged. Sure, it makes sense in terms of taxes, but it doesn't make sure in the stock market. I see it so many times, posts like ""I invested into X (shit) company, I don't know what to do. Please help"" with top replies being some combination of ""It's not a loss until you sell"" ""You already lost so much, might as well wait and sell covered calls"". If you don’t have no plan, and it's a shit company, **cut your losses.**  Sunken cost fallacy is a bitch. Don't sell your index funds, but if you bought into an EV startup (a mistake I admit ive done as well) in 2020, getting out while you still can is not a terrible idea, even it means ""realizing"" your losses (although they're just as real when they're M2M)"|0.2|0|0|0

t3_x1ju2c|1661867879|investing|Funny thought experiment that should never ever be applied|"I was checking some numbers and came across a pretty funny concept, I thought you might appreciate it.

In some places in the world, you can currently get a financing loan at a 1.1 interest rate, so I built this thought experiment.

[Using the principles of FIRE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BScK-QyWIo), there is empirical evidence that one could safely withdraw an averaged 3.75% of their portfolio adjusted for inflation (2.5% in bad years, 5% in good years, I averaged it out, but the average might be higher as the good years are more common).

Now let's merge these two concepts. Say you go to a bank and using your infinite charm you manage to get a very unrealistic 5M dollars to be paid back at a 1.1% rate over 60 years (Yes I know, if you ask for this you'll get kicked out, but stick with me, this is funny). All you have to do now is place your money in an index and... let's run the numbers.

Your monthly loan payment:  **9.489,45$**

FIRE safe withdrawal (3.75%) of 5M: **15.625$** (Assuming you live in a place with no capital growth tax, ex. Indonesia)

Money generated out of thin air: **6.136$** **Per Month**

Now, obviously, you would have to be absolutely insane to do this, and no bank will ever comply with this, I just thought it was a very funny thought experiment.

I wish I could live the easy boglehead life of “VTSAX and chill,” but I am overconcentrated in this one stock against my will, so I need to manually pick stocks and ETFs that diversify/hedge against AMZN performance.

Current allocation:
-	VTI: 30% (which I know includes a lot of AMZN, tech, and consumer discressionary)
-	VXUS: 20% 
-	**Remaining 50%**: Split roughly evenly between A, AEP, BRK.B, CLX, GD, HAL, HCA, JNJ, KO, LMT, MMM, MO, PG, PWR, TMO, TXN, UGI, UNH, VAW, VZ, XLF, XOM

I’m mostly just buying S&amp;P500 stocks in industries that are NOT tech and NOT consumer discressionary. But picking stocks is hard. What market am I missing? How can I better counter-balance against a large AMZN holding? I believe AMZN is a good investment… but I’m an engineer, not a day trader, and I really only need to do as well as the rest of the market.

Other notes:
-	No, I can’t buy AMZN puts. Company policy. And I’m not going to short QQQ. Stop. I’m looking for basic diversification help. 
-	I own a house, so I’m staying away from REITs and housing market-sensitive stocks. I’m overinvested in real estate too.
-	**I would love to hear about tech stocks and consumer discressionary stocks that don’t follow the price AMZN**. This is the most difficult place for me to invest. I own some TXN because IoT is the future and a little SHAK because hamburgers are delicious, but not much. I keep these bets small. I wish I could find something profitable and anti-cyclical with AMZN in these sectors.

After Powell's speech on Friday, he made it clear that they will not be making any pivot and that they won't be stopping hikes at the longer-run neutral rate. 

My question however is: why does it matter for inflation if the markets don't take the Fed seriously? 

As long as the fed keeps hiking rates and this cascades down into mortgage rates and cools down the housing market and slows down overall spending demand, isn't this all that is important for inflation to be brought under control? 

Even if the markets were to disregard the Fed, and if the S&amp;P500 rallied, how would this be of any concern to them meeting their mandate of controlling inflation? 

I appreciate that it wouldn't be ideal for the Fed to lack credibility, but could someone explain the mechanism of why it would be bad for inflation control? 

The only explanation i can think of concerns inflation expectations impacting real inflation, and a Fed lacking credibility couldn't use forward guidance as a tool. So is a stock market rally troublesome because it's an indicator of a Fed not having credibility? or is there a more direct link in how a rally would affect inflation?

t3_x0qiuz|1661784184|investing|Leveraging Money Flow: Cyclicals, Computer Software, and Retail|"Let momentum inform strategy to ride the coat tails of ""smart money"".

**Money flow indicates staying power.** That is, when money is flowing into a sector, related stocks will often experiences bounces after pull backs and develop sustained uptrends. And when money is flowing out of a sector, you might see pops get successfully shorted and bearish trends establish themselves.

**How to use this study:**

Day traders can use subsector momentum studies like this one to identify momentum stocks and develop greater conviction in a predicted move.

**The magic sauce:**

I use the Growth 250 list created by Investor's Business Daily (of which I am unaffiliated) to understand the depth and breadth of the market any given week. This is their best estimation of the top 250 growth stocks in the market. I keep a running study of this list, tracking money flows between subsectors.

Keeping an eye on this flow has proven to be a *huge boon* to my edge. I have found that when I trade in subsectors that are seeing changes in money flow that there is an increased level of continuation that correlates to the flow, whether positive or negative. And to put it simply, this translates into bigger moves with reduced chop.

# This Week's Money Flow Report

**TL;DR**

More rotation into other areas of Specialty Chemicals as the entire Chemical Sector flattens out with another industry group breaking out. Even more flow into Oil &amp; Gas and Utilities as commodities see continuation. Meanwhile Computer Software and Retail are looking like a sell.

**Buy Side**

* *Chemicals-Agricultural*
   * Cyclicals continue to lead as growth stocks sell on economic uncertainty. With the war in Ukraine continuing to wreak havoc on the Agri-chemical supply and the market seeking opportunity in essential commodities right, these names broke out last week. They look really extended and not actionable this week as more consolidation is needed. Still worth watching them action for more signals on how the market is reacting.
   * Favorite name in this industry group is: CF with NTR and MOS looking worthy too.
* *Oil &amp; Gas*
   * More of the same here. It will be interesting to watch big cap leaders XOM CVX MRO this week — would love to see them build a handle now. In addition, with any more uncertainty in the strength economy, these stock are could just as easily sell or at best need more consolidation.
   * One I like here from a technical perspective is RRC —  it has yet to really breakout. I also like the relative strength of APA MUR CRK. If I trade these names I may look to close out the position by day’s end to avoid any sensitivity to news catalysts versus trying to swing trade these oil &amp; gas names where they are now.
* *Utilities*
   * As stated last week, these are extended. Still, the inflow continues in these names. Similar to oil &amp; gas, I’d like to see them pull in here and make a handle. Utilities seem to have a head start on this as they were very extended going into last week and closed around the place I’d like to see as support for the handle.
   * AES has yet to break out of its base. NEE looks strong testing handle support to close Friday as well. AMPS is a very aggressive mover to watch — if it breaks out of the handle, could really run.

**Sell Side**

* *Computer Software*
   * With growth companies getting slapped by the Fed last week this is no surprise. Many have insane valuations with some worthy set up for short selling. These are strictly growth companies with high P/E ratios + book values that are going to suffer under tighter monetary policy.
   * Some worth watching include: FTNT DDOG NET SPLK $U OKTA
* *Retail*
   * With most of the big retailers reporting last week, we were able to build more of a picture of how consumers are behaving in today’s economy. Even the most defensive retailers struggled on their reports for many reasons we talked about in an earlier report. There are specific areas of retail to target based on last week’s reports and some additional technical analysis:

1. Wholesale Building Products — FAST FND LOW 2. Discount &amp; Variety — OLLI BIG FIVE 3. Leisure Products — DKS BFV ASO 4. Restaurants — SBUX YUM

# Review: Last Week

**TL;DR**

Last week added up to a very satisfying week to be long commodities, taking profit in solar/alternative energy and going short semiconductors.

**Fossil Fuels**

Last week’s *buy side* focused on coal names to respond to gains from alternative energy as of late. BTU made for a nice trade up nearly 12% for the week but was drug down by Chairman Powell’s comments to a final gain of 6.64% to close the week. Same story with the oil and gas names we identified, although they were also drug down into close Friday with everything else.

**Retail**

Value retail names did not pan out as hoped DLTR earnings report was highly disappointing. That said, we did not trade any of these but did notice that KR had more relative strength versus COST — which confirms an earlier concern that COST is probably a bit overpriced here by fair-value comparison.

**Utilities**

Utilities took a pause here as well. The SPDR Select - Utilities (XLU) did show some relative strength though, down only -1.53% and perhaps building a handle for more upside on a tough week for stocks.

**Semiconductors**

Last week’s sell side took focus on semiconductors with Nvidia’s lowered guidance going into earnings and most of those names looking very extended, that rotation was self-evident last week. Still the market’s response to Chairman Powell’s comments, from this mostly growth-focused area of the market, was SELL. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) finished the week -5.56% making for some powerful down moves.

**Alternative and Solar Energy**

We also looked to rotate out of alternative energy and solar positions as they take a pause. Enphase Energy (ENPH) still looks like it could hold this breakout range down only -3.74% on the week but will need some time to consolidate and produce enough earnings/sales momentum to decompresses the valuation before another leg up is rational.

First, their demo account supposedly mimics real market perfectly, and the only difference when trading real money is, well, the money being real. This is what one of their brokers told me on the phone, and their GM confirmed as well. 


Couldn't be further from the truth. Demo trading on their app is broken. You can buy an underlying asset of a stock, on market open, at the price it closed the day before. In a mattter of seconds the price goes way up or down, depending on the pre market and you profit. I confronted them about this, they said basically ""it is what it is"".

for example, just now, at market open, I bought around 600 dollars worth of BBBY, at 10,7 - the friday closing price. In two seconds I made 110 dollars of virtual money as the price went up.

Second of all, there are countless reviews calling the app a scam that doesn't let you withdraw. I confronted them on this as well and they said it's a problem that occures when the account isn't verified. But you can deposit up to 2000 euros.

And the third thing, what company connects you, some no name chump, with their general manager after you start asking questions. In my conversation with him he basically denied anything fishy going on, of course, and tried to convince me to start putting real money into the app,which I haven't and will not do.

But just recently I had another job where I worked for 2 years but was laid off due to business issues and I currently still have a 401k open from my old employer. Im still young(26) and just started my career and this has never happened to me until now. My question is can I rollover my employer 401k into an IRA? As I’m not contributing to it anymore. I’ve done some research and I’ve been interested in using either Fidelity or M1 finance, which is better? I do like M1 finance user interface and there pie chart feature seems way easier to keep track of how my retirement is looking. Until I find a better job with better pay and opportunities I will eventually have another employer 401k hopefully but I feel like I do want multiple retirement accounts as the advice I hear “it’s better to diversify”.

People are buying cars they can’t afford, repo rates are through the roof, and the shortage of supply is leading to dealerships charging absurd markups for average cars.

I really really hope a 2008 style correction happens soon, otherwise cars are going to follow the footsteps of housing in terms of unattainability. There are already 96 month auto finance options so only a few steps until we’re talking mortgage numbers

It’s not that the financing *rates* for cars are terrible, its that cars are so expensive that the financing *terms* have had to skew *far* longer than a normal auto loan.

It used to be that the average car loan was 36 months. Now, with cars so expensive, they've had to kick financing options out to *96 months*. Even at a low interest rate, carrying an auto loan for *8 years* is pretty ridiculous.

Auto loan *rates* be damned, the cost of cars has gotten so inflated.

t3_wzdzmi|1661635675|investing|Fed rate rising actually add to inflation?|"Given our current model of debt-driven-cheap-globalized-production consumption economy, wouldn’t it be possible that raising rates may  actually increase inflation because increase in cost of liquidity-capital will increase the cost of production more than its impact on dampening demand.

Now we know that raising rate will decrease demand. But it also makes capital/liquidity more expensive which means supply will also be negatively impacted. It used to work because the impact on demand has been greater than the than the impact on supply. However, given the easy/free money policy on a global scale, capital and liquidity has been cheap which artificially makes cost of production and supply cheaper as well. In addition, given the ultra low interest environment, all these liquidity is chasing return thus further reducing cost of production/supply.

Now, the world has been operating on this easy/cheap money for almost 2 decades. I would argue that even the cost on supply/production side is artificially made cheaper due to the free/easy money policy. Now, with the world’s economy as is, i think raising rates will not reduce inflation because as it tempers down demand, it also reduce production/supply more."|0.31|0|0|0

t3_wz3do0|1661608280|investing|Which has more debt - Home Depot or Lowes? The answer is not so obvious.|" 

Hi fellow investors! I thought about the latest HD report and their economic model, then compared their performance with LOW, and what I want to say - the amount of debt these companies have may be frustrating. It’s like analyzing REITs - you feel that something is wrong. In general I use financial stability and liquidity ratios to quickly assess companies.

[https://imgur.com/MbmJIVa](https://imgur.com/MbmJIVa)

First indicator to determine is Liquidity, which based on 3 main ratios:

* Cash Ratio = Cash + Cash Equivalents ÷ Current Liabilities, must be &gt; 0,2
* Quick Ratio = Cash + Cash Equivalents + Short-term Investments + Accounts Receivable ÷ Current Liabilities, must be &gt; 1,0
* Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities, must be &gt; 2,0

&amp;#x200B;

||HD|LOW|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|155 239|95 392|
|Total Liabilities|75 588|55 167|
|Cash ratio|0,045|0,072|
|Quick ratio|0,179|0,095|
|Current ratio|1,18|1,11|

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see both companies are experiencing a huge lack of liquidity. In general these ratios tell us that a company does not have money to pay its current liabilities and can be on the verge of bankruptcy. But HD is TOP 3 holding of SCHD, how can it be? The answer covers in its debt, so we need to look to second ratios of financial stability, which based on:

* Equity Ratio = Total Equity ÷ Total Assets, must be &gt; 0,4
* Debt Ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Assets, must be &lt; 0,6
* Interest coverage ratio = EBIT ÷ Interest Expenses, must be &gt; 1,5
* Debt to EBITDA = Total Debt ÷ EBITDA, less is better

&amp;#x200B;

||HD|LOW|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Equity ratio|0,0031|&lt;0|
|Debt ratio|0,99|1,18|
|Interest coverage|16,5|54,5|
|Debt to EBITDA|1,57|2,11|

&amp;#x200B;

Retail companies have a lot of money in circulation and little in assets, and deliveries with deferred payments increase current accounts payable (their “assets(goods)” recorded in the balance sheet as liabilities). They also have good margins and can use loans effectively without having to freeze their own funds, because their money comes from sales, not assets (many retail spaces are leased).

Well, what conclusions can be drawn on comparison: HD has more debt, compared to LOW in flat numbers, but vice versa in relative comparison.

HD has a fairly conservative debt to EBITDA ratio and its EBIT covers its interest expense 16.5 times over. It grows revenue quicker and greatly uses leverage, has greater net profit margin and ROA.

LOW has cheaper debt (less interest expenses, EBIT covers it 54,5 times), has more liquidity, but debt grows faster than earnings. Debt counts as healthy when it’s cheap and the company can grow faster because of it.

So if you choose between them, what is more attractive? I personally stick with HD."|0.8|29|0|29

AAPL like literally any good company they could buy but no. Warren buffet doesn’t even invest in indexes. Bogleheads are getting on my nerves.. why buy and get 10% a year when there’s more out there. They just need to actually think but I guess the people investing in the jack bogle style don’t really do that or know what companies are actually good. 

Indexes are probably best for 401ks if you don’t have a brokerage link 401k but other that that I don’t think indexes should be a large part of your portfolio or small part like 5% or even 0%.

t3_wxlvdy|1661452639|investing|An Easy Way to outperform the index|"*Edit: Please understand this post is supposed to be ironic. The point of it is to show that the platitude of ""no one can beat the market"" is completely wrong, but not in a way that offers a useful portfolio allocation in itself. It is just an exposition of a counter-example in which beating the market is fairly likely. But this counter-example is not necessarily a good / bad thing to do. It is pretty much equivalent to the market itself.*

I've heard it time and time again. It is very hard to outperform the index, or even worse, ""no one has outperformed the index"" even though there are numerous examples where this is false.

So I have for you a way to outperform an index, let's say the SP500, with a 78% chance.

How does it work? Well, a google search provides that:  ""according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, only **22%** of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 outperformed the index itself from 2000 to 2020"".

So how to fail? Pick 1 stock out of the SP500 and make that your portfolio. This will not have a high success rate as you are 22% likely to win. This also shows why concentrated investors will not have a good chance of outperformance.

However, what will win? Do the opposite approach. Create your own SP499 (of course weighted appropriately). What do I mean?

Start with SP500 weighted accordingly. Pick 1 stock to exclude from the SP500.   With this cash from the 1 stock sale, allocate the extra cash to your portfolio according to its current stock weights. Basically you will beat the SP500 if your excluded stock fails to beat the SP500.

**Congrats, now in the future, 78% of you will be able to say that ""I beat the index"".**

&amp;#x200B;

I know this sort of proves the ol' ""hard to beat the index"" adage as most investors tend to be concentrated.

Also you would only beat the index marginally whereas the handfuls that beat the index by being concentrated would most likely crush the index. So pros and cons. We can go further down the academic rabbit hole that implies diversification but who cares...

As for that I would say:

I do think beating the index can be skill based rather than luck based. I don't think I have seen a good counter argument to Warren Buffett's letter, ""The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville"": [https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/articles/columbia-business/superinvestors](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/articles/columbia-business/superinvestors)

I do also agree with Warren that it is especially hard to beat the index when excessive fees are charged.

EDIT: This isn't a recommendation! I'm not saying this is necessarily smart! Unless you make a side bet with someone who thinks you can't beat an index.

TL;DR: Don't read. Nothing worthwhile. Just some thoughts."|0.73|529|0|529
t3_wxkklg|1661449487|investing|"Trying to understand the reasons behind the ""value premium"""|"Value stocks, over the very long term, have shown outperformance over growth stocks:

Between 1926 and 2020, value stocks had a premium over growth stocks in 100% of 20 year rolling periods and 92% of 10 year rolling periods (1).

&amp;#x200B;

I have recently been trying to establish **why** value investing provides higher returns but I have found it difficult to find any conclusive answers.

Generally,  I subscribe to the idea of the efficient-market hypothesis. It just seems implausible to me that in a market where approximately $60 trillion worth of trades are happening annually, with thousands of experienced analysts and high-speed trading supercomputers for there to be assets   which happen to be underpriced for no reason at all.

I can understand in less liquid and less efficient markets (e.g. micro/small cap value stocks) there may be a lack of institutional investment - resulting in some significant inefficiences. However, that doesn't explain the value premium in other value stocks (e.g. large cap value).

I believe the value ""premium"" is simply derived from the increased risk of value stocks. For example, I can understand that a company may be cheaper than its competitor if it is undergoing some financial distress -  meaning that is investment could yield both a higher potential return (for example following recovery from the financial distress), but also be riskier (the financial distress may continue to harm the company).

There is an abundance of academic research backing the risk premium theory of value stocks. There is also plenty of research suggesting the opposite -  that value stocks are not significantly riskier. It seems that among retail investors most view the value premium as due to factors *other than* a simple risk premium.

&amp;#x200B;

What  I am trying to understand is: if value investing is not inherently more risky (thus having a risk premium) what, in your opinion, explains the value premium?

I am starting a new position where I will be making $425-480k My primary employer has a 457/401a (govt 457) that they will match X%. I plan to do this. 

They also offer a supplemental retirement 401a which is not matched and based on the handout (I believe from 2019) I can contribute an additional amount in 5% increments up to 20% up to a defined limit of $57k. Enrollment in the supplemental plan is a one-time irrevocable election (that sucks). This is a tax deferred retirement account. I have to decide to sign up for this or not before I can sign up for the employee matched account. 

I’m 35yo. 5 years into PSLF with 55 payments left for forgiveness. Only other debt is $4k on car loan. I’m not sure if I should enroll in the supplemental and if so, what percentage of income to do. What are the pros and cons of the supplemental? Vs. taxable brokerage account vs REIT etc. 

Is there any advantage to not maxing this account out and putting it in a brokerage account where I have more control over investments?

I don’t see my tax bracket changing unless I get married which could then possibly bring me into the next lower bracket.

I have been regularly investing my savings into ETFs for about 2 years now. My choice was few different Vanguard ETFs. Since I'm from EU, opening an US Vanguard account was not possible and EU Vanguard has much higher costs (EU equivalent S&amp;P500 has 0,8% expense ratio compared to 0,03% of VOO).  


To go around this issue, I have been using eToro as my trading platform and buying Vanguard ETFs there. Now I figured out through ToS that all my positions on eToro are considered CFD!! I was shocked and now I'm scared. I don't have any leverage or similar, but I am still not sure this is a good long term investment approach (I don't have much knowledge on CFDs as I was never interested in short term risky trades).  


So, my question is:  
a) From investment and growth perspective, is there any real difference between ETF and un-leveraged CFD? Should I move my investment somewhere else?

I have the option to exercise $15,000 worth of options. Trying to weigh up the risk vs reward here to make an informed choice. I could do with some help - here are some options...

**Option One: Buy Startup Options**

Execute the option agreement at a cost of $15,000 in cash. Hope the company at least increases in value by x4 (positive scenario). Have $60,000+ in the future if they go public but risk losing all $15,000 (negative scenario).

*Less* the opportunity cost of investing the $15k passively. In 10 years it's worth $32.8k (with an 8% return per year).

Net out: $0-$27k (best case at x4 value 60k-33k = 27k and worst case -$15k).

**Option Two: Don't Buy Startup Options - Invest Passively**

Do not execute the option agreement at a cost of $15,000 in cash. Instead invest the cash passively.  In 10 years it's worth $32.8k (with an 8% return per year). There's much less risk of the money going to $0.

**Option Three: Use (Equitybee) or similar to Buy Options &amp; Derisk**

Execute the option agreement at a cost of $0 in cash (given Equitybee lend the cash). Assume the startup does well and is valued at $60k; Give Equity Bee (or similar) 30% of the stock (and vow to pay back the $15k lended after an IPO with 3% interest. Hope the company at least increases in value by x4 (positive scenario). Note: If the company folds or does not IPO you owe Equitybee nothing.

*Net Out: $0-60,000 - $5,158 (interest) - $15,000 (principle amount borrowed) - $18,000 (their stock reward) = $21,842 plus the value of the $32.8k (future value of the $15k invested passively).*

***Leaning towards option three low risk and decent upside. Let me know your thoughts. Thanks for your help...***

*Assumed that it will take 10 years for the company to go public. And they will at least 4x return. With option three above a 5.5-6.5x return would break-even with option one but option three carries less risk.*"|0.55|2|0|2

However, I have been uneasy about how much USD currency exposure they have, given its strength (or overvaluation?) at the time I transferred my funds in. Investing in USD from CAD is a bet USD will continue to strengthen relative to CAD, and I don't know that it will.

I recently discovered Horizons managed portfolios (HBAL.to and HGRO.to) which are a similar solution to my desire for a passive strategy, but are currency hedged, with an even lower management fee. I considered transferring all into those, but hedging currency exposure 100% is just the opposite bet on the direction of the CAD/USD exchange rate. I am betting that USD will weaken in relation to CAD, and I don't know that it will.

That’s when it occurred to me. Traditional portfolio compositions (70/30, for example) make use of the magic of regular rebalancing to sell a little of whatever is overperforming and buy a little of whatever is underperforming to maintain a consistent ratio of asset types according to your risk level – if I understand the purpose of rebalancing correctly. I remember reading a very thorough article once that suggested that in most cases historically (TINA excluded) the right allocation and consistent rebalancing actually allowed the portfolio to outperform any of its constituents alone (namely equity) over the long term via what is essentially an automated schedule of buy-low/sell-high in small doses.

So why couldn’t I apply the same principle of rebalancing to currency hedging my portfolios to take advantage of fluctuations in the CAD/USD exchange rate in either direction over the long term?

To look at the simpler of the two examples, while the assets within HBAL and Questwealth’s Balanced Portfolio are different, they are very similar, and contain a fair amount of overlap in class and returns. The major difference to me is that one holds its assets primarily in USD, and the other is entirely currency hedged to CAD – all other differences between the two amount to slightly more diversification for similar risk/return trade off. All in one, or all in the other, I am making a bet on the direction of the USD/CAD relationship. 

However, if I were to make my portfolio a balance of 50% of each, and maintain that balance for the long term, would I not be able to actually take advantage of fluctuations in the USD/CAD exchange? If the USD soars, my USD portfolio would overperform (as valued in CAD) and rebalancing would sell some U.S. assets at a high to buy some more of the underperforming CAD-hedged (rough) equivalents at a low. If the USD falls, my CAD-hedged portfolio would overperform, and rebalancing would sell some of the CAD-hedged assets at a high to buy some of the underperforming (as valued in CAD) USD assets at a low. Over the long term, with regular rebalancing, would this not work out to improved returns over going either 100% hedged or unhedged?

tl;dr: Is a 50/50 split between USD assets and CAD-hedged equivalents with regular rebalancing the most efficient, automated, and low-risk way to neutralize or even profit from currency fluctuations over the long term given their cyclical relationship?"|0.86|19|0|19

Assuming Chad has $100,000. Where should he invest his money?

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1: Buying a House

Starting with $100,000 as 20% down payment. Chad can afford a 500k house.

Taking out a $400,000 loan - Chad pays $678,240 (using Google's mortgage calculator, 15-year fixed, 720+ credit score, New York State Property) a 15-year mortgage at around 4.7% interest rate (includes taxes and insurance). **Interest Rates Today**

Chad saves 62,846 in taxes on interest **Tax Deduction Calculator**

Home Value Yearly Rent

500000 60000

526850 63222

555141.845 66617.0214

1039938.664 124792.6396

1095783.37 131494.0044

Total Rent: 1462853.49

500,000\*(1.0537)\^15 = 1,095,783 is the new home value after 15 years (assuming 5.37% YOY increase, based on data from 1970 to 2019 **Housing YOY Data**)

60,000 in rent a year (at first based on monthly rate of 1% of home value **Rent Calculator**)

Total Rent Collected = 1,462,853

Summary:

\- 278,240 interest + property taxes + insurance

\- 121,904 in repairs (1 month rent on repairs rule **Maintenance Budget**)

\+ 62,846 tax savings

\+ 595,783 home value increase (430,453 assuming 15% capital gains tax **CG Tax**)

\+ 1,462,853 rent (1,023,997 assuming 30% tax rate)

= 1,117,152 = \~ 1,117k in total profit

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2: Index Funds (S&amp;P500)

**S&amp;P 500 performance**

Assuming the s&amp;p 500 continues to grow at the same rate of 10.57% since 1970 factoring in reinvested dividends. In 15 years, the value of the investment should be.

100,000\*(1.1057)\^15 = $451,398

Profit: $351,398

**Capital Gains Tax**

Actual after-tax Profit: $351,398 \* .85 = \~ 299k in total profit

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3: Investing using margin in Index Funds (S&amp;P 500)

Assuming Chad uses Robinhood's Margin Account:

He can get another 100k in margin.

200,000\*(1.1057)\^15 = 902,796

If chad can pay off the borrowed amount over 2.5 years (paying 40,000 a year), he will accumulate interest of:

year 1: 100,000 \* .05 = 5,000

year 2: 60,000 \* .05 = 3,000

year 3: 20,000 \* .025(only the first half of the year is needed) = 500

Total Interest = 8,500

Summary:

\+ 902,796 new value

\- 200,000 original investment

\- 8,500 interest

694296 (590151.6 Assuming 15% Tax)

= \~ 590k in profit

National debt is close to or much higher than GDP in most developed nations.

Increasing interest rates in every developed nation that may continue to rise, potentially to high single digits if inflation is not curbed.

Thus, with respect to any given transaction in ETNs, Barclays may be unable to determine whether the ETNs it sold or otherwise transferred out of its DTC account were Subject Securities. Further, underwriters, distributors, or others who transact through DTC accounts or other similar mechanisms may be similarly situated. Additionally, because many ETNs are sold in transactions over an exchange, the identification of buyers and sellers who participated in relevant transactions can present additional challenges.""*

I'm not a big fan of my 401k. The offerings are slim not to mention I prefer my Roth IRA.

So not to leave any money on the table, I do invest in my 401k so my company will match it 50% (up to my 4%) So, I invest the minimum 4% and they match 2%.

So, spit balling here:

I was thinking, ""can I get it out and working better for me?""

I am able to take out 2 loans from my 401k and the rate is about 5% ish. So, if I do nothing else but borrow as much as I can from the 401k, I will end up putting in 9% and the company matches 2% for a total of 11%.

I mean I am feeding the 401k more money, but I wonder if the funds I would borrow would serve me better in my general investment account. The idea is that I just need to make more out of the 401k than in right?

The more funds I put in, the bigger the next loan can be once the first is paid off.

&amp;#x200B;

Or would I be better served putting an additional 5% (loan rate) of my post tax income into my investment account?

At some magic number this is worth while. Would 100% return be viable? of course. Would 50% rate of return work? sure would... would 15%? hmm.. now we're getting down to the real discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

By Megha Mandavia

Aug. 22, 2022 6:07 am ET

&amp;#x200B;

This column is part of the sixth annual Heard on the Street stock-picking contest.

&amp;#x200B;

BYD, China’s largest electric-vehicle maker, has had a stellar year. Gathering clouds over the Chinese economy could prove a temporary headwind but the company’s business acumen is hard to argue with: The Warren Buffett-backed auto maker managed to extend its lead over domestic rivals in July, with sales of its new-energy vehicles more than tripling to a record.

&amp;#x200B;

Beijing’s continued commitment to the sector also helps. The stock has almost doubled from its 52-week low in March on the back of government incentives for cleaner vehicles. BYD now trades at 56 times next 12 months’ estimated earnings, according to FactSet, matching U.S. rival Tesla but much lower than smaller Chinese peer Li Auto, which sits at 109.

&amp;#x200B;

And as China competes with the West over green energy and high-tech manufacturing, domestic adoption of electric vehicles continues to accelerate rapidly. BYD, now one of the world’s most valuable car makers, is emerging as a big beneficiary, assisted by its vertically integrated operations that include battery- and chip-making capabilities. The number of battery electric vehicles sold in China reached nearly two million in the first half of 2022, according to HSBC. The bank estimates BEV penetration in China will rise from 17% in 2022 to 30% in 2025.

&amp;#x200B;

Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, expects BYD’s share of China’s new-energy-vehicle market will rise from 26% in the first quarter of this year to 36% in 2023 and 45% in 2025. One reason: BYD designs and produces practically all of its vehicles’ most valuable components, including batteries, motors and some semiconductors like microcontrollers. That has proven to be a huge advantage in recent years as supply-chain snarls have tripped up competitors, including Tesla, and gives BYD an edge by allowing it to shorten its product cycles.

&amp;#x200B;

BYD is also scouting lithium mines to protect itself from surging prices of the essential battery metal. Despite rapid sales growth, BYD’s margins were hammered last year due to high raw material prices. Net margins fell to 1.4% in 2021 from 2.6% a year earlier, according to FactSet. That compares to Tesla’s 10.3%.

&amp;#x200B;

There is some hope of that reversing however, as commodity prices retreat again and new, pricier models hit showroom floors: The models in BYD’s launch pipeline are twice as expensive as prior ones, according to Goldman Sachs. The bank expects BYD’s net margin to expand to 2.2% this year and 2.5% in 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

BYD has also paid down debt rapidly in recent years and as of December had more cash and short-term investments on hand than debt according to FactSet—a reverse of the situation as recently as June last year. In the downside scenario of a nasty Chinese recession, that could prove to be an important cushion.

&amp;#x200B;

One obvious challenge at home will be getting buyers to pony up for pricier cars with China’s economy, potentially at least, deep in the doldrums. But for now at least, the company still seems confident. BYD, which reports on Aug. 29, said in July that first-half net income could climb as much as 207% to 3.6 billion yuan, equivalent to about $528 million.

&amp;#x200B;

Sustaining such heady numbers will be a challenge but with strong, cost-effective technology, an integrated supply chain and Beijing’s determination to dominate the sector, it would be a mistake to count BYD out."|0.4|0|0|0
t3_wus4dy|1661170711|investing|How Occidental Petroleum Captured Warren Buffett’s Eye - Wall Street Journal|"By Benoît Morenne and Akane Otani

Aug. 22, 2022 7:48 am ET

&amp;#x200B;

As the pandemic set in, investors including Warren Buffett ditched shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp. Now, the oil-and-gas producer is the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 this year, and a newfound favorite of the veteran investor.

&amp;#x200B;

More than two years after selling off its common shares of Occidental, Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the company’s largest shareholder with about 20% of its stock, according to recent filings, and Mr. Buffett received regulatory approval Friday to buy up to 50%.

&amp;#x200B;

Buoyed by soaring commodity prices, Occidental has substantially paid down its debt load and is generating cash. The company now looks like a strong fit for Mr. Buffett, say investors and analysts. It is strengthening its balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders; it holds the largest position in the most active U.S. oil field; and it is investing in technologies to reduce carbon emissions, which some of Mr. Buffett’s businesses are also doing.

&amp;#x200B;

“It checks off a lot of his boxes,” said Steven Check, chief investment officer of Check Capital Management, which is invested in Berkshire. “It’s American, it has great cash flow and it’s a rational capital allocator.”

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Buffett has publicly praised the strategy of Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub, and many analysts have speculated Berkshire could buy the entire company. Mr. Buffett hasn’t informed Occidental of any plans to acquire a controlling stake in the company and is unlikely to do so in the near-term, people familiar with the matter say.

&amp;#x200B;

“What Vicki Hollub was saying made nothing but sense,” Mr. Buffett said at Berkshire’s recent annual shareholder meeting. “And I decided that it was a good place to put Berkshire’s money.”

&amp;#x200B;

Under Ms. Hollub’s leadership, Occidental has cut its debt load, repurchased shares and raised its dividends. Like other companies, it has also been conservative about boosting production, despite oil prices rising.

&amp;#x200B;

That strategy is paying off. Occidental generated a record $4.35 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter and $3.7 billion in profit. After its shares fell roughly 80% in 2020, Occidental’s stock has jumped 146% this year, a rally driven, in part, by Mr. Buffett’s purchases.

&amp;#x200B;

The company still faces challenges. Long-term doubts remain about demand for oil and gas as some countries shift to greener energy sources and some investors remain wary of the industry. Occidental is also betting big on carbon capture, a technology whose profitability is unproven.

&amp;#x200B;

Occidental entered the pandemic saddled with debt from a $38 billion deal to take over rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp., part of which it funded with $10 billion from Berkshire. Plunging oil prices led the company to lay off employees and cut executives’ salaries—including Ms. Hollub’s—and slash expenses in the oil patch.

&amp;#x200B;

But while the deal looked ill-timed, analysts say, the assets Occidental acquired from Anadarko have since helped solidify its position as the largest producer in the Permian basin, the prolific shale oil field in West Texas and New Mexico. The company said it produced roughly half a million barrels of oil a day domestically in the second quarter of the year, compared with about 280,000 barrels before it acquired Anadarko.

&amp;#x200B;

Occidental has said it generates a profit when oil prices are as low as $40 a barrel. In the second quarter of the year, Brent crude oil prices averaged $114.1 per barrel and U.S. crude prices averaged $109.9 per barrel, according to Scotiabank.

&amp;#x200B;

All facts point to Occidental being a play on domestic oil production for Mr. Buffett, said Bill Stone, chief investment officer of Glenview Trust, which held shares of both Berkshire and Occidental as of the end of the second quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Buffett has also boosted his purchases of Chevron Corp. this year, making it Berkshire’s fourth-largest holding.

&amp;#x200B;

Occidental has said it aims to reach net-zero emissions on its operations and energy use by 2040. The company has invested in carbon removal through its Oxy Low Carbon Ventures and plans to develop the first industrial-scale plant to capture carbon dioxide from the air, which it says will require upward of $1 billion in investment.

&amp;#x200B;

The company’s focus on becoming a greener operator may inform Mr. Buffett’s appetite, analysts said. Berkshire’s energy unit, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, has stated a goal of retiring its coal units by 2049 and achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

&amp;#x200B;

Occidental intends to develop 70 plants to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere by 2035, it told investors in March. It has said it would invest between $100 million and $300 million through its low-carbon unit this year. Investment bank Truist Securities said in a June note that more than 10% of Occidental’s total business could come from its carbon capture division in a couple of years, up from less than 5% currently.

&amp;#x200B;

The $433 billion climate package President Biden signed into law this month could accelerate the development of carbon-capture projects, industry experts say. The legislation raises the tax credit for direct air carbon capture and sequestration to $180 per metric ton from $50 previously.

&amp;#x200B;

The credits are helpful for carbon capture businesses, but some scientists say it is unrealistic to deploy the technology on a large scale because it needs huge amounts of energy, while some environmental groups say it could prolong fossil fuel consumption.

&amp;#x200B;

Ms. Hollub told investors earlier this month that the climate package was a good development for the company, pointing to the tax credits as one reason why “this is turning into for us a net very positive bill.”

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Buffett has long been a buyer of oil and gas ventures, not always successfully. In 2008, he bought a large amount of ConocoPhillips stock when oil and gas prices were near a peak, just before they fell.

&amp;#x200B;

“The terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars,” Mr. Buffett wrote in the company’s 2008 annual report."|0.69|12|0|12

Aug 19, 2022 at 4:25 pm ET

&amp;#x200B;

Occidental Petroleum owns a power plant in Taft, La., that feeds an OXY chemical plant next door. Leftover power is sold on the local grid, which Berkshire Hathaway Energy plants also feed.

&amp;#x200B;

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruled that since OXY's plant accounts for just 0.48% of the capacity connected to the region's grid, a combination with Berkshire ""will not have an adverse effect on competition"" in the local electricity market.

&amp;#x200B;

Warren Buffett's Berkshire had to ask, though, before beefing up its 20% stake to as much as half of OXY's shares. Now the market has gotten a rare glimpse of what the famous investor has up his sleeve."|0.94|285|0|285

However I feel like direct indexing might be the better route *for me.* As I have enough funds to buy stocks that represent the whole market, I only am able to use a taxable account and would be able to contribute 20-30k a month. 

I've done a bit of reading on direct indexing, and it seems like the upside is 1-2% of tax loss harvesting over buying an ETF the mirrors the same stock allocation, but comes with the downside of potential of small tracking issues, which could be in my favor or not and that currently brokers offering direct indexing charge .25%- .40%... Fees I dont like, but if the tax loss harvesting works, its still a net gain, and the brokers offering it all seem to have a consensus that 95%+ of direct indexing users make up the cost of those fees.

Vanguard along with several other big brokers have picked up direct indexing firms in the past 2 years, with Fidelity and Schwab being some of the first of the big brokers to launch it to individual investors. So it seems like it might be becoming the hot new offering soon, and hopefully we see fees get cut as more brokers offer it.

There is also the benefit, or con, that you can tweak your holdings with direct indexing. Pruning a couple companies in your holding that you dont believe are justified. Probably not a popular idea here, but it becomes an option, unlike holding say VTI where you are forced into every company even if you strongly believed it was overweight. Doing this will screw up tracking, but could result in more gains, or losses.

“We suggest refraining from actively sell- ing equities, as that could compromise longer-term portfolio construction and involves the difficult de- cision when to redeploy funds once the market bot- toms and negative news flow is likely to be at its strongest. Instead, an elegant solution, which al- lows for both the protection of portfolios from a potential market drop and the opportunity to stay fully invested, is to enter a short position in the portfolio’s underlying index. This is exactly what we decided to do at the beginning of August by selling future contracts on the S&amp;P 500 in a manner that would decrease equity portfolio risk by 4% across all risk profiles.”

Would be awesome if you could help me understand it a bit better: 

1. Does it essentially mean that In order to do what bank recommends above i would: 

Sell futures contract for let’s say s&amp;p 500 with let’s say current price levels of 4200 in the future date (let’s say October). 

Then my game plan is in case in October SP500 closes below 4200 I can then sell my futures at a profit. 

At the same time my maximum risk would be that I would have to sell S&amp;P 500 at 4200 while it’s market price could be let’s say 4500 missing out the 300 usd upside. 

Do I get logic correctly? 

2. Is it possible to execute the contract at an earlier date normally ? 

3. Can I instead of Selling sp500 at lower price just sell the contract ? 

4. In order for me to sell futures, do I need to own the underlying at the time of initiating the trade? 

5. And lastly, why wouldn’t I want to use options for this? (Buying puts on sp500)

The matrix in my previous post used a base case of 2023 S&amp;P Earnings of 250 based on analyst estimates at the time, and a 17.5x forward P/E ratio at year-end. This produced a S&amp;P 500 price target of 4,375 at year-end. I then applied a +/- 5% range to the 2023 estimate, and a FWD P/E multiple range of 16x to 19x to produce a price matrix or sensitivity analysis for a year-end S&amp;P 500 price target.

What's changed:

* Inflation is trending higher than I thought it would have been heading into year end. I expected for the US to be comfortably below 6% by now. We are probably only a quarter behind schedule, and I think it's possible that YoY inflation is below 6% at year end. The surprise was the Ukraine war and subsequent high(er) gas prices delaying the softening of inflation.
* Because of higher than anticipated inflation, risk-free rates have continued their march higher more confidently than I initially expected. I thought the fed would have to pivot and pause rate increases at 2% or 2.5%. As of now, I'm guessing we get one more 50 or 75bp hike to 3%, and then the fed pauses.
* Because of higher rates, an earnings recession is becoming more likely. Because of this, earnings forecasts have been revised lower.
* Also because of higher risk free rates, valuation ratios like p/e have continued to experience compression. Forward P/E ratios are a bit elevated right now, but I think that the market is trying to call the fed's bluff to raise rates to 3%. I think that when the Fed raises rates to 3% or higher, I think that forward P/E and stock market prices will decrease a bit from where they are today (4,228 S&amp;P as of 8/20/2022).

My updated base case is 2023 earnings of 235, and a 17x FWD P/E ratio, which is a year-end price target of 4,080 (a 3% decline from where we are today). The matrix is updated below with +/- 2.5% range on earnings (reduced from a 5% range on my original matrix considering we are closer to 2023 and have better insight). The baseline 2023 earnings has been reduced to 240, based on analyst estimates, considering lower earnings as a result of inflation and higher recession risk. The matrix also excludes the possibility of a high 19x P/E, considering multiple compression as a result of higher than anticipated risk free rates.

The low end of this matrix is only 56 points lower than my original matrix, although the high-end is much lower. I thought that the fed would have to pivot at some point during this year and possibly reduce rates. Due to higher inflation, the market has endured or allowed rates to go higher without dysfunction. As long as markets are functioning and credit markets don't freeze, the Fed will continue to raise rates. It seems that the market ***wants*** the Fed to fight inflation, and so has ***allowed*** them to increase rates higher.

t3_wt7zxp|1661004508|investing|need feedback for my Investing strategy|"Hello

Is this good strategy if I feel bearish short term (till the end of the year) neutral 12-18 months out and bullish long term?

I've been managing my own investments for last two and a half years. Through the proces of trial and error I came up with my Investing strategy. I am not sure does it make sense so I would like some input.


85% is in various ETFs. I believe its well diversified and its my long position. This is a portion of my portfolio that I don't plan to touch for years. Some Of the ETFs are cover call ETFs because I think medium term markets will stagnate. Those ETFs I might replace if I see signals that stagnation phase is over. 


15% of portfolio is in Cash and hadge against short term downward movement. I usually buy puts no les than 45 dte or calls and some shares on invers ETFs.


My hedge usually are no more than 5% of my portfolio. Sometimes I would just buy puts on heavy movers from recent week or two.

I am also adding some Euro currency to my long position.

Any recommendations please?"|0.72|61|0|61

Yet, so many people still use or even swear by technical analysis, which is essentially just an interpretation of price movements, and therefore of past performance. Similarly, most financial models are tested using backtesting on a subset of historical price data.

Clearly, the disclaimer does not match up with real practices. And if those practices were *complete* bogus, no one would be doing them.

t3_wsi199|1660925831|investing|How does the Fed truly get inflation down with limited housing inventory?|"The Fed is focused on getting inflation down. To measure inflation it looks at [CPI and PCE](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/comparing-two-measures-of-core-inflation-20190802.htm). Between these two measures, the [Fed looks most at PCE](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/29/inflation-figure-that-the-fed-follows-closely-hits-highest-level-since-january-1982.html): "" Fed officials generally focus on core inflation, but have turned their attention recently to the headline numbers as well, as food and fuel prices have soared in 2022. ""

CPI on the other hand, has shelter as a very large component. Due to both heightened pandemic &amp; WFH demand and low inventory, housing surged in 2020-21 and [has been contributing to inflation](https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/publications/housing-insights-housing-poised-become-strong-driver-inflation): ""pressure is building within the largest component of the index – shelter – and it could replace current surging components as the major driver of measured inflation over the coming quarters.""

Even if the Fed ignores CPI and wants to look at core PCE, [housing is still a decent chunk there](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2021/0824):  Rent and owners’ equivalent rent (OER)—the amount of rent equivalent to the cost of ownership—are among the most important components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index (*Chart 1*). *This measures 12.9% in the linked chart.*

The Fed's primary tool is interest rates, acting to reduce demand and lower prices. This is already working as [we are in a housing recession](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/18/home-sales-fell-nearly-6percent-in-july-as-housing-market-slides-into-a-recession.html) (calm down its not an 08 crash). Now we get to the crux of the problem.

Housing remains ""[savagely unhealthy](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/the-savagely-unhealthy-housing-market-is-now-a-nightmare/)"" due to inventory below  2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019 levels. Because housing is cooling, [builders have slowed or even stopped construction of additional inventory](https://www.kcra.com/article/real-estate-market-cools-home-building-stalls/40657531). Even if the Fed can kill demand, their effects are muted if supply remains constrained.

**TLDR:** The Fed needs inflation to come down -&gt; part of inflation is housing -&gt; housing can't come down with the Fed's action alone because there is not enough supply -&gt; inflation remains elevated for a long time

I would love to hear your thoughts and see what I am missing here? Where are the blind spots? I don't see how the Fed doesn't revise its inflation target &amp; strip housing out of it, or commit political suicide by causing mass unemployment to cause foreclosures.

***Edit 1:*** *Thanks to the gracious data provided by other users, FRED data shows there is no inventory shortage vs what the NAR shows. Rookie mistake for only using one source. Hypothesis is that the run up in housing was interest rate and demand driven. As M2 declines so too has stocks and housing.*

***Edit 2:*** *not all housing markets are created equal. Many posters note that where they live prices are still up and inventory tight, others note things are correcting hard. Comparisons of Detroit to San Diego, or Bend to Baton Rogue will only be true up to a point. People moving during covid could have created some dislocations in this regard.*"|0.88|429|0|429

From 2005 to 2015 the S&amp;P rose 96%.  In that same time period GDP grew 19%.

From 1994 to 2004 the S&amp;P rose 118%.  In that same time period GDP grew 39%.  

From 1994 to 2004 the S&amp;P rose 202% higher than the GDP.  From 2005 to 2015 the S&amp;P rose 405% higher than the GDP.  Finally, from 2016 to now, the S&amp;P has risen a whopping 681% more than the GDP.  

The S&amp;P is currently priced at 4,283 and has grown 681% more than the GDP since 2016.   

But what would be the current price of the S&amp;P if the market behaved like it did, relative to the GDP, between the years 1994 to 2004 and between 2005 to 2015?  

If the market was only up 55% since 2016 as opposed to 86%,  it would mean the market would be 400% higher than GDP which is similar to the percentage increase during the period of 2005 to 2015.  In this scenario the current 2022 price of the S&amp;P would only be 3,230. 

However, if the market was only up 23% from 2016 as opposed to 86%, it would mean the market would only be 200% higher than GDP which is similar to the percentage increase during the period of 1994 to 2004.  In this scenario the current price of the S&amp;P would only be 2,506.

So what does all this mean?  Is the market ridiculously overbought?  Was perhaps the market chronically under bought between 1994 to 2015? Bears will say we are living in a super bubble headed towards a crash of epic proportions. Bulls will say living with higher equity prices compared to GDP is simply the new norm.  It is difficult to say who is right just yet.  But one thing can be said.  We are in uncharted territory ladies and gentleman."|0.38|0|0|0

https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-high-stakes-inflation-game-wall-street-bets-the-fed-is-bluffing-11660830685?mod=hp_lead_pos10

The Federal Reserve says it is going to keep raising interest rates.

Wall Street thinks it’s bluffing.

This could spell trouble for both of them.

Markets pummeled by the Fed’s rate increases in the first half of the year are racing upward. The S&amp;P 500 is up 17% from its mid-June low. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which is used to help set rates on debt such as mortgages and student loans is down more than half a percentage point from its June peak. Even battered cryptocurrencies have jumped.

For many investors, the rebound reflects a belief that inflation has peaked, and expectation that the Fed will shift from raising rates to lowering them sometime next year.

A parade of Fed officials has tried to push back. “There’s a disconnect between me and the markets,” Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said last week.

An expectation the Fed will start cutting interest rates in the next six to nine months isn’t realistic, Mr. Kashkari said. ***It is more likely the Fed will “raise rates to some point, and then we will sit there until we get convinced that inflation is well on its way back down to 2%,”*** he said.

If the Fed follows that path, markets are likely to face a painful reckoning—one that could unwind much of the recent rally and extend what has been a tumultuous stretch for investors from retail traders to hedge funds to pension funds.

“We think the market is getting ahead of itself,” said Wei Li, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock Inc.

Rallying markets also make the Fed’s job tougher. Rising stock and bond prices have loosened financial conditions since the Fed’s June meeting. That works against the central bank’s aim to slow spending and reign in inflation by raising rates enough to tighten the flow of money in the economy.

***“You need to keep financial conditions tight. That’s the whole point of this,”*** said Marc Sumerlin, a senior economic adviser to President George W. Bush who is now managing partner at economic consulting firm EvenFlow Macro.

Any acknowledgment by the Fed that inflation is easing risks spurring further market gains. That could lead to even looser financial conditions, slowing the central bank’s efforts to tame inflation, said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.

“Now, you’re sort of undoing a lot of the hard work the Fed has been doing this year to slow the economy,” Mr. Draho said.

**Fed faith**

To understand how the two sides got so far apart, it helps to look back.

For decades, investors have put their faith in the “Fed put,” the belief that when markets fall substantially, the Fed will lower interest rates, purchase bonds or otherwise increase liquidity in the financial system.

The belief dates to the 1980s. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was quick to cut interest rates during such upheavals as the Black Monday crash in 1987, the Russian financial crisis and subsequent meltdown of hedge fund Long Term Capital Management in 1998, as well as the dot-com bust in the early 2000s. By the time Mr. Greenspan left the Fed in 2006, investors had come to expect it would always be there to provide cover.

For much of this year, the Fed put was in doubt. The central bank raised interest rates in March and signaled it would continue at a brisk pace to attack inflation, which had reached multidecade highs. U.S. stocks suffered their worst first half of a year since 1970. Investment-grade bonds posted their worst first half in history.

Then came the unexpected. Investors started to believe the Fed would again come to the rescue, despite much evidence to the contrary.

In June, the Fed voted to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point, marking its biggest rate increase since 1994—presumably bad news for the markets. But traders clung to Mr. Powell’s words at the postmeeting press conference. The Fed chairman acknowledged the rate increase was “an unusually large one” but not something he expected to be the norm.

Stocks jumped, with the S&amp;P 500 rising 1.5%.

Then at a July 27 news conference, Mr. Powell tried to strike a balance between his earlier public remarks revealing concern about the strength of underlying inflation while also suggesting the Fed was eager for signs of improvement that the central bank won’t have to raise rates much above 4% or 5%. Wall Street interpreted him to mean the Fed was open to slowing down its pace of rate increases.

The S&amp;P 500 ended the day 2.6% higher. The Nasdaq Composite surged 4.1% for its biggest one-day gain in more than two years.

Traders have pulled back from bets on inflation. The five-year break-even rate, a proxy for where traders believe inflation will be over the next five years, has fallen to around 2.6% from as high as 3.6% in April. Labor Department data this month showed inflation eased slightly in July but remained near its highest level since November 1981.

Some of Wall Street’s top analysts have cautioned about reading too much into recent stock gains.

Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist and chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley, is forecasting the S&amp;P 500 will end the year around 3900, down 8.8% from where the broad index closed Wednesday. At Bank of America Corp., Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, is expecting the S&amp;P 500 to finish 2022 even lower—at 3600, a fall of 16% from Wednesday’s close.

Skeptics of the rebound say that even if inflation turns out to be peaking, it likely won’t fall fast enough for the Fed to pivot as quickly as the markets expect.

The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation—the personal-consumption expenditures price index—rose 6.8% in June from the same month a year earlier. That was far above the central bank’s target and the sharpest rise since January 1982. Investors will see the July reading later this month.

“The market is still pricing more aggressive cuts than we think are warranted,” said Ms. Li, of BlackRock. “We see the Fed eventually pivoting on policy, but not as much as the market is expecting.”

A challenge for both sides is that the Fed doesn’t appear to have confidence in its ability to accurately forecast inflation, which makes it difficult to predict when the central bank will stop raising rates.

***“We now understand better how little we understand about inflation,”*** Mr. Powell said at a forum hosted by the European Central Bank in June.

***Economists outside the Fed are divided over how aggressively the central bank should attack inflation. One camp says even if it falls over the next 12 months, it is likely to settle at 4% or higher, a level most Fed officials would consider unacceptably high. That would make it difficult for the central bank to lower rates to the levels that fueled markets in recent years.***

Some of these economists suspect the Fed isn’t being forthcoming about how high it believes interest rates will need to go for inflation to fall to 2%.

Another camp warns that the Fed, embarrassed about waiting too long to pull back its support of a booming economy last year, will compound the error by tightening too much. These economists believe the current surge in inflation is the result of global shocks rather than an overheated U.S. labor market, which would require a much deeper downturn to bring down inflation.

**‘Unpredictable beast’**

Investor faith in the Fed put has strengthened in recent years. Markets slumped in 2018 as the central bank raised interest rates four times and investors fretted over the seeming end of easy-money central bank policies. As the central bank paused its rate increases and then switched to cutting rates the following year, stocks went back up.

They tumbled again in March 2020 after the Covid-19 pandemic shut down economies around the world. They bottomed out within the month and surged after the Fed cut interest rates and relaunching its bond-buying program.

“The fact that the Fed is very hawkish today doesn’t mean they can’t go dovish in a few months. That’s happened over and over again,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist of The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.

Yet in recent instances when the Fed eased rates, the central bank was having difficulty pushing inflation up to its 2% target. Investors and Fed officials were ultimately reacting to the same growth risk. With inflation running high, that is no longer the case.

If the Fed holds tight to its plans, markets could be in for a tough ride. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. research found the stock market had fallen at least 15% on 17 occasions going back to 1950. In 11 of those instances, the market only hit its trough around the time the Fed started easing monetary policy.

Mr. Paulsen believes the case for further interest-rate increases has weakened. But he acknowledged that trying to predict how the Fed will respond to inflation in the months ahead is almost impossible.

***“The reality is that right now, the market is enjoying the Fed put,”*** he said. “We’re all dealing with a very unpredictable beast.”

t3_wrl2d4|1660833056|investing|Is Value Just an Interest Rate Bet? &amp; The Amazon Fallacy - Cliff Asness, John Authers|"Cliff's full piece is [here](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/Is-Value-Just-an-Interest-Rate-Bet) and the related Bloomberg Opinion piece is [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-08-17/amazon-fallacy-looms-in-the-growth-rebound-as-investors-overlook-value?srnd=opinion). The broad theory posited by these two pieces is that, unless a growth company is a true unicorn, perhaps interest rates don't have as much influence on the growth vs. value performance as we often assume, and has been empirically witnessed over the last decade or so. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It seems obvious to so many that interest rates drive the value trade. After all, growth stocks have much longer-dated cash flows than value stocks and thus should be a “longer duration” asset and move more with longer-term interest rates, right? “Growth (or often just ‘tech’) stocks soar on plunging interest rates” (or vice versa) has become a common wise-sounding observation in the last few years. In fact, this is all taken as an axiomatic given in countless pundit and press observations. However it’s not nearly that simple, and mostly it’s just not true.

Cliff goes on to examine the oft-cited HML value factor from the Fama French Five Factor model and its rolling 5 year correlation to the 10 year Treasury yield. [Graph here](https://imgur.com/CMy0xZ5) and [scatterplot here](https://imgur.com/KX3aodE)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The average correlation is quite trivial (around 0.10), although (like every time series ever) rolling subperiods vary. In particular the most recent five years has seen quite high correlations between the value factor and interest rates, bouncing around the highest ever observed and economically significant.

In recent years, that correlation between rates and value has become stronger, but does this make sense? 

&gt;Well, in a word, no. A lot of it comes down to growth assumptions. By definition, growth stock investors believe their portfolio (or individual stocks or even stonks, whatever the h\*\*l those are) will outgrow value stocks. And they’re right. On average, using our very diversified global value factor to sort stocks, the expensive ones outgrow the cheap ones by about 4% a year over the next five years. Actually most of that comes in the first two years where the majority of any predictability seems to reside. After five years it’s certainly a push (no steady excess growth in year six onwards).

Why do so many investors still chase growth despite the evidence that reliably predictable growth trends dissipate after two years? Cliff's opinion:

&gt;It seems, particularly if you, like me, think we’re in a bubble, that growth investors are all trying for unicorns.

[This](https://imgur.com/LnaccDX) chart from Cliff's piece is a good visual of how many investors view growth investing - like the stocks they are picking are all unicorns. 

And this is a good transition point to the Bloomberg Opinion piece from John Authers where he relates ""unicorns"" to what he coins the ""Amazon Fallacy"". 

The point is made that yes, investing in Amazon early would've yielded outsized returns, but many companies were trying to follow a similar path at the time. However, most wouldn't succeed to become the near-monopoly that Amazon would. The argument is summed up well in the below quote. 

&gt; It became so profitable and dominant because it eradicated the opposition and became a virtual monopoly in many of the things it did. Of its nature, the success of Amazon cannot be replicated by many at any one time. There can only ever be few startups that go on to build a large and well-defended monopoly. Asness’ point is that growth investors are behaving as though all growth stocks can be Amazon, and they can’t. 

This leads to, in simplified terms, the notion that interest rate sensitivity (duration) of true unicorns may have some merit in having longer durations, but for most growth stocks, duration is not materially different than value stocks - [this](https://imgur.com/LnaccDX) chart again. This is because the near-term growth in growth stocks doesn't affect duration much, but if you knew growth would explode in 5, 10, 15 years, then that would certainly justify a longer duration. So for unicorns, the bulk of cash flows stemming from that extraordinary growth will be in the distant future and supports the sensitivity to interest rate movements because unicorns would have much longer duration than ""normal"" growth stocks and  value stocks. The below quote references [this](https://imgur.com/LnaccDX) chart again

&gt; *A duration of 10 years means that a 100 basis point fall in rates would, to a linear approximation, lead to a 10% increase in market value. If all three investments are assumed to have equal long-term expected returns... the “duration” of the growth portfolio (blue line) is 0.4 years longer than the duration of the value portfolio.  If you think that’s trivial, you are correct.* 

To round out the discussion:

&gt;If investors in 1999 had had an accurate grasp of Amazon’s future cash flows, its share price should have been very sensitive to interest rate changes. But unless the growth stock you hold truly is a unicorn, lower rates really shouldn’t help it much compared to a cheap value stock.   
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, one of the few things we know for sure is that the great majority of growth stocks aren’t unicorns.

I am sure there were useful pieces from Cliff's writing and the Opinion piece I left out, but I think both pieces give good credence to re-examining which securities you choose to purchase and for what reasons and hopefully the dots were connected enough to make sense. 

I own growth stocks and value stocks and everything in between, hold nothing with AQR, and understand Cliff leaves a lot of the commentary unsupported with data. Talking his book or not, food for thought and debate was the aim of this post."|0.76|25|0|25
t3_wrky75|1660832768|investing|The official recession label will come too late to have a major impact on stocks|"Who calls a recession in the U.S.?

The National Bureau of Economic Research is responsible for defining a recession and it does not use the “2 quarters of negative growth” definition. The NBER definition is more complex, taking into consideration many factors. A group of eight academic economists are saddled with the task of declaring an “official” recession.

The group examines many indicators in their work as the Business Cycle Dating Committee (no, not that kind of dating). That committee, first convened in 1920, is led currently by a 78-year-old Standford University professor and has taken as long as a year after recession onset to decide if a recession occurred. Wall Street nearly always recognizes a recession before the NBER official announcement. The committee doesn’t even hold regular meetings.

The committee is looking for a “substantial decline in activity over a sustained period of time.” The data used include monthly reports on real personal income, nonfarm payrolls, personal consumption spending, manufacturing sales and industrial production.

The committee is highly respected as it has been unaffected by politics in making a recession call. The members are independent of government, although some committee members have advised previous government administrations. It is likely that no recession call will be made before the November elections.

In 2008 Fed chair Ben Bernanke said that people should not get hung up on the technical definition of a recession.

The official declaration of recession is never helpful as a warning signal. Those pronouncements come much too late. Stock market downturns usually anticipate recessions, by as long as nine months. And the NBER can take a year to act after the recession begins.

The U.S. is affected by the world economy. The downturn in China is gaining momentum. The trouble in the property sector, starting with China Evergrande and spreading to other developers guarantees a serious slump there. Germany may already be in recession as natural gas deliveries from Russia have been cut back. The U.S., China and Germany combined make up about one-half of the world’s GDP.

With central banks all over the world hiking interest rates a substantial slowdown in activity is a certainty.

Waiting for a committee to use the r-word is not a good investing strategy."|0.38|0|0|0

I'm hoping someone here can either point out the risk or I just helped the readers of this post earn an extra 2.5% in their portfolio as well.

So I obviously have a portfolio.  The holdings of portfolio can be used as collateral to take out loans.  In my case, I can use the portfolio to take out a loan at 4% APY.  The loan amount is 50% of the portfolio with a 42% liquidation margin.  

Now, I have discovered a platform that offers fractional real-estate investing of rental properties.  Shares of properties are sold and rent dividends are paid out daily.  The CoC return of occupied rental properties range anywhere from 5% to 12%, with most falling in the 8-9% CoC range and an IRR of 13-14% over the next 3 years, calculated by HouseCanary. 

The platform will also buy-back shares of the property at 95% it's value if you want to sell your share back.  The platform has a 5% listing fee, so this is why it isn't 100%.

My thought is to use my portfolio as collateral to take out a loan at 4% APY and purchase shares of multiple (reduce risk) rental properties on a 1+ year lease with a 9% CoC return paid daily.  4% will go directly to interest payments and 5% will be used as I see fit.  

My portfolio will grow at the current rate it is growing, with 50% (loan amount) earning an extra 5% (so 2.5% as a whole).  If the liquidation margin gets close, I can simply sell the shares of the property back to the platform and use the proceeds to pay down the loan more quickly. I know I could use the proceeds to add more collateral, but personally I don't want to risk runaway leverage.  If this happens, I would lose the 5% listing fee.  However, if the property value increase by 5%, I hold for &gt;1 year (so pocket 5% in dividends), or a mixture of the two, I will break even.

Is there any other risk I am missing? I understand it's theoretically possible for my portfolio to drop 40% in a day and I get liquidated, but I don't see this happening in reality."|0.74|55|0|55

I would use $700 from a paycheck (this a comfortable amount) and use it to by $700 of SPY shares on my interactive broker's account. At the same time and in addition I would buy $300 of VOO. My thoughts are to keep them separate so that when I sell to close the margin it will be clear and mentally I can track it this way. I do not have IBKR pro and I could switch to that for a lower rate. But if this were to be held for 10 years lets say and if borrowing rates stay below 8% then theoretically i could collect the spread. And with that, would it be better to reinvest VOO dividends or take the cash to decrease the margin amount.

t3_wqixdr|1660722679|investing|Why does Real Estate seemed to be the most popular investment (even more popular than the SP500)|So many people talk about and are looking to get into real estate due to fact that they see it as a secure investment and they could life of rental income. Although heavily talked about, not many people are into the SP500 and other index funds compared to real estate. Firstly, if you own real estate, you most likely have to maintain it, spending money and **effort** on fixing pipes, lightbulbs etc. With a company in the SP500, if something breaks down (e.g. the IT network) you are not required to go to company and physically fix it. In addition, yes companies can go down in value or become bankrupt but the same can happen for houses. Think of fires and natural disasters. And with real estate, a huge portion your money is concentrated in one place. With the SP500, it is spread across 500 American companies with a diverse range of industries. With regards to that it does seem a little odd that so many people are into real estate investing. Yes, you can argue that is wise for someone to buy their first home but at that point it is not really investing. That is just essentially securing a roof over your head.|0.69|25|0|25

After a year that can fairly be described as an [omnishambles](https://archive.ph/o/mz4qR/https://www.ft.com/content/9eadcb9c-e828-4385-b1c7-22029ee7dae8), Chase Coleman is desperately trying to douse out Tiger Global's portfolio of dumpster fire tech stocks and limit the already record book-worthy [50 per cent loss](https://archive.ph/o/mz4qR/https://www.ft.com/content/87347d49-390d-408b-9059-2e5a42b5787c) in its flagship fund this year.

The latest [13F regulatory filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167483/000091957422005053/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml) revealed that in the second quarter of the year it had ditched Robinhood, Zoom and DocuSign entirely and hacked back positions in the likes of Coinbase, Carvana, Snowflake, and DoorDash.

Tiger Global's overall public equity exposure to stocks is now down to $11.9bn, according to the [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001167483/000091957422005053/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml) that dropped on Monday. At the end of 2021 it stood at almost [$46bn](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001167483/000091957422001371/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml).

**The timing of the fire sale was . . . unfortunate, given that many of these stocks actually bounced back in July. Robinhood alone is now up over 35 per cent since the end of the second quarter. Carvana's shares have more than doubled over the same period.**

But to FTAV the most intriguing new move was the addition of a $12.8mn position in a small company called **Lamb Weston**.

Eagle, Idaho-based Lamb Weston is one of the world's biggest producers of frozen potato products, like the french fries you can find in your local supermarket. It used to be owned by ConAgra, until it was spun out and listed in 2016, and is now valued at almost $12bn.

Trivia fans might appreciate that Lamb Weston invented the water gun knife technique that revolutionised the industrial production of fries since the 1960s.4

Despite a professed dedication to what the company calls ""Potatovation"", Lamb Weston might seem like a weird investment for a major hedge fund overwhelmingly focused on fancy tech bets.

**We scoured the website for any mention of machine learning, leveraging the blockchain, quantum computing or big data, but it really does seem dedicated to just shipping gargantuan amounts of frozen fries** ([80mn portions a day on average, apparently](https://investors.lambweston.com/~/media/Files/L/Lamb-Weston-IR/documents/lamb-weston-corporate-fact-sheet-jan-2022.pdf)). Perhaps the simplicity is the attraction to Tiger, as Bucco Capital [noted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/buccocapital/status/1559336822995566593).

FTAV suspects that it is simply just a small but potentially canny inflation hedge for Tiger, something that might help counter some of the pain elsewhere if inflation continues to pummel its portfolio.

But given the still-huge size of its positions in many unprofitable tech companies, it's going to need a bigger potato bet than $13mn.

t3_wpxs96|1660665030|investing|Buffett Made Occidental the Kind of Company He Can Love - Bloomberg|"By Liam Denning

August 16, 2022 at 9:50 AM EDT

&amp;#x200B;

Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy and commodities. A former investment banker, he was editor of the Wall Street Journal’s Heard on the Street column and a reporter for the Financial Times’s Lex column. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the benefits of being Warren Buffett is that you make things happen just by showing up. If he so much as gestures at a stock, it is liable to pop immediately, providing a nice self-fulfilling gain. When it comes to Occidental Petroleum Corp., the Buffett effect runs far deeper than that, and yet it is less pronounced — which says a lot about the US oil sector in 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s latest quarterly holdings filing, which dropped late Monday, showed a 17% stake in Oxy, as it is known, as of June. In reality, other filings put the stake above 20% now. In any case, Buffett’s company is Oxy’s largest shareholder by far. As recently as last December, Berkshire owned none of the company’s common stock. That doesn’t mean Buffett wasn’t a presence though. Far from it.

&amp;#x200B;

Some history. In 2019, Oxy got into a bidding war with Chevron Corp. for Anadarko Petroleum Corp., an exploration and production firm. In order to beat Chevron, a much larger oil major, Oxy went all in, eventually paying a 54% premium to Anadarko’s undisturbed share price, with four-fifths paid in cash. To fund that, Vicki Hollub, Oxy’s chief executive, made a Gulfstream pilgrimage to Omaha to secure a $10 billion check. In selling preference shares and warrants in Oxy to Buffett, Hollub also avoided having to put the deal to her own shareholders, who were, judging from the slide in Oxy’s share price, somewhat aghast.

&amp;#x200B;

They were right to be. They’d been sidelined, and the timing was awful. Oxy swapped an appealing equity story of decent growth and solid dividends for debt-laden empire building — just as the oil price began dropping and a year before the pandemic took hold. No one could foresee a pandemic, of course. But oil crashes? They happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Oil’s subsequent rebound, as Covid-19 eased and Russia invaded Ukraine, has helped enormously. Net debt and preferred equity dropped from more than $54 billion when the Anadarko deal closed to around $32 billion today. The eviscerated dividend has been partly revived, and buybacks have resumed. Oxy’s stock has more than doubled this year, trouncing the sector and the market.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, if you actually owned Oxy before the Anadarko debacle kicked off, then perhaps you feel relieved but maybe not like a winner.

&amp;#x200B;

Factor in dividends and buybacks, and the annualized return on Oxy’s stock since then has been all of 3.2%. That’s less than half the yield on that preferred stock to Buffett. And it’s a fraction of the 15.1% and 16.3% made on the energy sector and the S&amp;P 500, respectively. The biggest winners? Those Anadarko shareholders, with a 130.9% annualized return.

&amp;#x200B;

When Buffett provided that $10 billion at a cost of 8%, it was viewed by some as a bet on oil prices. I saw it as merely a function of having enough money lying around to lend to a desperate borrower at a cost of 8% — good job, too, given what happened to oil the following year. But the really remarkable thing is that, by showing up with $10 billion when he did, Buffett ended up turning Oxy into the kind of company he would like to bet on.

&amp;#x200B;

Those high-cost preference shares mark Oxy out from the rest of the sector, weighing on its valuation. The company can’t begin redeeming them until 2029 — unless it has paid out $4 per share on its common stock, via dividends or buybacks, in the prior 12 months. So here we have a trifecta for Buffett: A discounted stock in a company forced to be disciplined by its balance sheet and also incentivized to pay out cash rather than reinvest it. The kicker? Buffett’s own $10 billion check is the underlying cause.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on payouts to date, and assuming flat dividends, Oxy would hit that $4 per share mark by the end of 2022 if it buys back roughly another $2 billion between now and New Year’s Eve. Forecast free cash flow is more than triple that, so it looks easily done.

&amp;#x200B;

While Buffett’s relationship with Oxy is unique, taking a fifth of the company — and more than a quarter if you factor in his warrants — means he is bullish on oil and gas prices. He clearly expects them to remain healthy enough for the foreseeable future to support Oxy’s continuing buybacks and preference share dividends. This has fueled speculation that Berkshire might acquire Oxy outright. That’s possible, though it must be asked why Buffett would pay a takeover premium. His lock on the capital structure already gets him what he wants in terms of spending discipline and oil-price exposure.

&amp;#x200B;

The more intriguing aspect was pointed out to me by Dan Pickering, founder of Pickering Energy Partners Inc., a Houston-based investment firm. He is struck by how, in contrast to the usual hoopla when Buffett takes a stake in something, his big bet on Oxy this year (as well as Chevron) hasn’t sparked a widespread reappraisal of oil stocks. “It tells you how far out of favor the sector is,” he says.

&amp;#x200B;

That’s correct: Despite the jump in commodity prices and earnings, energy remains just 4.1% of the S&amp;P 500. The same day Berkshire filed its disclosures, oil slumped by 3% on renewed fears of a slowdown in China. On the other hand, the war in Ukraine is ongoing and Brent crude remains above $95 a barrel. Buffett mustn’t see that changing anytime soon, and he is instinctively drawn to unloved sectors. In Oxy’s case, he also gets to create the reality he prefers."|0.9|113|0|113

Innoviz Announced a $4 billion Deal with Volkswagen

Innoviz Technologies, founded in 2016, develops navigational sensors for self-driving cars. Innoviz was one of the first Israeli startups to successfully merge with SPAC by deciding to merge with Collective Growth Corporation and began trading on NASDAQ in 2021. 

The stock gathered momentum after the company announced a deal with Volkswagen. According to Innoviz, the deal value is more than seven times the company's market value of just over $500 million. Innoviz will provide LiDAR technology and software to VW's autonomous vehicle unit, CARIAD, beginning in 2025. Over eight years, Innoviz expects to supply 5-8 million LiDAR units across multiple Volkswagen Group brands. 

HUB Gets Picked by Stock Guru Cathie Wood

In July, Cathie Wood, the renowned investment manager behind Ark funds, added Hub Security stock to the Ark Israel Innovative Technology Fund, as evidenced by the recently filed holdings data for this fund. Hub seems to be the only new Israeli company to be added to Wood's Israeli Tech ETF ""IZRL,"" alongside many others which were removed – something that is quite a strong signal for the young company. 

The company is also planning to go public in the United States in a $1.3 billion merger deal with SPAC Mount Rainier Acquisition Corp. (RNER). The deal is expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year.

It is 109 today. I am getting nice return but I have a believe this share I should hold for 2 years at least. I was reading its financials and comparing with other banks (small and large cap ones) and I find Federal bank is undervalued and its actual value should be in 4 digits at least. It could be over estimation but it is my believe from what I could understand by reading its balance sheet, financial statements and analysing and comparing its loan portfolios.

So, selling uncovered calls and puts have unlimited potential for losses as most of us already know. And traditional straddles cancel each other's losses out.  Traditionally people would just buy a call for what I wanting, that would minimize risk of loss but would also leave potential profits on the table in a downswing.  Uncovered Calls and Puts are usually cheaper than covered calls and puts because there's more risk.  

But what if you sold both an uncovered call and put at the same strike price for an 'uncovered straddle.'  Wouldn't then the unlimited losses cancel out?  Or would this still have unlimited loss potential because profits are limited on the call and put?"|0.45|0|0|0

I just started a new government job a few months ago. This job offers a pension which takes out 6.36% pre-tax of my income. This contribution flexuates year-year and I cannot choose. It also offers a trust fund 401k matched at 6.2% and a 457. In the trust fund 401k, I have options to contribute with pre tax, post tax or into a Roth 401k account. I chose to contribute mostly Roth dollars and lower pre-tax dollars since I anticipate having higher income in the future. 

This job is unique in that they do not participate in social security so I do not pay into that program. 

For the 457, I chose to contribute roughly 3.5%. This is all pre-tax follar

And in addition, I do have a personal Roth IRA and a brokerage account. I stopped contributing to the Roth once I got this job because of the other retirement options but plan to contribute when I can. 

My brokerage account I do want to begin using more. I have money sitting in my savings account that I believe would be better to allocate some to the brokerage account. One of my questions is - Is it worth having a brokerage account and a 457? I feel like are kind of the same. I don't like having excess accounts and would prefer to simplify things. The only difference being one is pre and one is post tax... What do y'all think? Would you just keep one and contribute to just one or do both? 

And can I get some feedback on this current setup?

t3_wp3e5r|1660579531|investing|Third Point accumulates a position in $DIS. Gives 5 suggestions to unlock further value.|"Dear Bob:

Congratulations on a terrific quarter and positive momentum in Parks, ESPN, and media and entertainment. We were particularly pleased to see the strength in DTC subscriber growth, the key driver of Disney’s long-term transformation towards less volatile, ultimately higher margin cashflows with a greater return on invested capital. As we wrote to our investors at the time of our initial investment in 2020, which highlighted the extraordinary potential of Disney+, we liken this evolution of the Company from “analog” theatrical releases towards digital distribution to Microsoft’s transition from selling software in plastic wrap boxes to a SaaS model. We expect to see the quality of Disney’s financial results improve as the Company’s business shifts further.

We have had over two years to observe management navigate the most challenging time in Disney’s history, as you led the organization to simultaneously grow the DTC business, guide the Parks from pandemic closures to record-revenues and profits, and create quality entertainment content. This quarter’s results are an important proof point that Disney’s complex transformation is succeeding and our confidence in Disney’s current trajectory is such that we have, in recent weeks, repurchased a significant stake in the Company.

We have also filed Hart-Scott-Rodino approval with the Federal Trade Commission so that we can engage with management and the Board in order to work directly and constructively with all parties, since the Company will likely require additional strategic, capital allocation, and governance changes to ensure its success.

I realize some of our suggestions may already be in the works, but since we do not possess any material non-public information, we thought it might be useful to share our thinking on five important initiatives that we believe will unlock further value in the near-term.

1.
Cost Cutting: Disney’s costs are among the highest in the industry, and we believe Disney significantly underearns relative to its potential. We urge the Company to embark on a cost cutting program that addresses both margins and the disposal of excess underperforming assets.
 
2.
Dividend Policy: In a prior letter, we proposed that the Company continue the policy initiated under Covid when parks were closed to suspend payment of a cash dividend. We urge the Company to preserve this policy and use free cash flow to pay down debt, repurchase shares, or organically reinvest in the business.
 
3.
Hulu: We believe that integrating Hulu directly into the Disney+ DTC platform will provide significant cost and revenue synergies, ultimately reigniting growth in the domestic market. We urge the Company to make every attempt to acquire Comcast’s remaining minority stake prior to the contractual deadline in early 2024. We believe that it would even be prudent for Disney to pay a modest premium to accelerate the integration but are cognizant that the seller may have an unreasonable price expectation at this time (while noting the seller has already made the decision to prematurely remove their own content from the platform.) We know this is a priority for you and hope there is a deal to be had before Comcast is contractually obligated to do so in about 18 months.
 
4.
ESPN: ESPN is a great business that currently generates significant free cash flow, enabling the Company to pay down debt and increase strategic options down the line. In addition, we realize ESPN content is part of the bundle being offered to subscribers of other products, both in Disney’s Linear and DTC businesses. Despite these advantages, we believe that a strong case can be made that the ESPN business should be spun off to shareholders with an appropriate debt load that will alleviate leverage at the parent Company. The important questions to ask before commencing a spinoff are:
 
Will both companies be better off?
Will the needs of customers be better served?
Can any synergies that exist between the two companies be replicated by contractual arrangements?
Will the transaction contribute to creating long-term value for Disney shareholders?
 
While acknowledging that broader capital structure considerations may be at issue, we believe that the answer to all four of these questions is affirmative. Employees of ESPN could be compensated in a security directly tied to their performance. ESPN would have greater flexibility to pursue business initiatives that may be more difficult as part of Disney, such as sports betting. Customers of ESPN and sports leagues would be better served by a focused management team driving a leadership position in sports distribution. We believe that most arrangements between the two companies can be replicated contractually, in the way eBay spun PayPal while continuing to utilize the product to process payments.
 
Lastly, as a result of this transaction, both companies will attract shareholders seeking the respective qualities of each company, allowing the Disney parent multiple to expand as its earnings growth rate increases and the remaining business is no longer haunted by the specter of cord cutting. While I understand you have considered this idea in the past, we urge the Company to retain advisors to reassess the desirability of the transaction in the current environment, recognizing that a key determination would be the proforma capitalizations, cashflow and credit profile of both companies.
 
5.
Board Refresh: Disney is a world-class company that deserves a world-class board of directors who possess diverse talents and experience with strengths in technology, advertising, and consumer engagement, as well as proven track records of leading large complex organizations and creating shareholder value. This is not meant to single out any current board members, but we believe there are gaps in talent and experience as a group that must be addressed. Third Point has identified potential board members who we believe would make essential contributions to the Company’s Board at this critical time. We would be happy to make an introduction.

I look forward to discussing these topics with you, Christine, and when practicable, the Board and company advisors.

Sincerely,

Daniel S. Loeb

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario A:

\- I own 10 shares of stock A EACH in my taxable account and ROTH IRA account

\- I sold 5 shares of stock A in my ROTH IRA account (taking the LOSS) and 10 days later I bought 2 shares of stock A in my taxable account

&amp;#x200B;

Is this violating the wash sale? - I think the answer is NO

Scenario B:

\- I own 10 shares of stock A EACH in my taxable account and ROTH IRA account

\- I sold 5 shares of stock A in my TAXABLE account (taking the LOSS) and 10 days later I bought 2 shares of stock A in my ROTH IRA account

&amp;#x200B;

Is this violating the wash sale? - I think the answer is YES

t3_wp1rp9|1660575460|investing|Don't fight the Fed, but there's more|"I'm not a market timer in the sense that I don't sell when the market goes down, but I will sit on my cash when there are certain events that make it logical the market will be moving lower. One of those is the old saying ""Don't fight the Fed"" meaning invest aggressively when the Fed is lowering rates, and be more conservative when they are raising rates.

I came across another market sentiment today that I may have overlooked and perhaps others can share some history. The 10 year treasury hit a 52 week peak on 6/13. The S&amp;P hit it's 52 week bottom on 6/17. The 10 year treasury has been trending lower while the S&amp;P 500 has been trending higher. 

For all the talk of the Fed raising rates, there's not ben much discussion of the Fed unwinding their massive balance sheet. Also consider that the Inflation Reduction (sic) Act will require the issuance of more debt, if both the Fed AND the treasury are sellers, seems like that would cause prices to fall and positively affect equities. But it seems counterintuitive that the Fed raising rates would lead to a lowering of the 10 year treasury rate?

This is why no market sentiment is cut and dry. Like Warren Buffets 2 Rules of investing: 1, don't lose money. 2, don't forget rule number 1. Well he took a major loss selling the airlines. But just curious if others agree with this pattern or is there something else I'm missing?"|0.36|0|0|0

The firm’s investment in Flow is about $350 million, according to three people briefed on the deal, valuing the company at more than $1 billion before it even opens its doors. The investment is the largest individual check Andreessen Horowitz has ever written in a round of funding to a company.

There are a lot of cattle raised in this area that go to JBS slaughterhouses . Additionally, the Leprino cheese factory is nearby and they supply 85% of chain pizzerias. I was wondering if there were any people familiar with raising cattle that could state any known effects.

My postulation would be that the ranchers will be able to bale more nutrient dense grasses and possibly increase yields/healthier cattle. If the cattle are healthier, perhaps they require less medication in addition to not having to buy as much feed and maybe that frees up cash for a tractor that the rancher has been eyeing for a while. Maybe the healthier cows produce more milk and lower prices and pizza chains get better deals?

Watching the rain generally going out towards Nebraska and Kansas, I assume the grass increase isn't just local.

* Why are companies which miss earnings seeing an immediate increase following their earnings call
* when companies which beat earnings see an immediate decline following their earnings call

I acknowledge this company-by-company specific, my hope is that I can glean some wisdoms from the experts in this sub as part of my ongoing journey in options and investing in general. below are 3 examples:

## The Business

Incorporated in 1999 as MCM Capital Group, Encore Capital has been in the business of specialty finance. More specific: debt buying and recovering. The company buys defaulted consumer debt for a fraction of the face value and will try to recover it from the debitors. With an industry size of $15 billion dollars, Encore Capital has a market share of around 10% with $1,6 billion in revenue for 2021 (1). It is the largest of five big agencies in the US and has expanded to UK and Europe with the acquisition of Cabot Credit Management (CCM), which is the largest debt purchaser in Europe.

## Industry Enviroment

The debt collection industry has grown at a CAGR of just 2,7% since 2017 (2). Now it’s experiencing problems to further increase their portfolio purchases, which showed to effect in Encore’s recent purchase history. Encore is the industry leader by revenue with a large market share, which rises the questions for further growth opportunities. Both the industry and the company mainly get their supply in receivable portfolios from credit card debt. As both the amount of credit card debt and the delinquency rate have decreased significantly since 2018 (7), Encore Capital hasn’t been able to expand it’s portfolio investment due to the resulting decrease in supply.

## Acquisition of CCM in 2018

On July 24 2018 Encore bought CCM for around $415 million ($234 million cash / $181 million stock). In the same year CCM brought in $523 million dollar in revenue and $100 million in pre-tax earnings. This acquisition is more than just fine to me at an P/E of 4. Going forward to 2022, those numbers didn’t change much.

## Financials

## Revenue Drivers

To generate revenue, Encore buys receivable debt and collects it. If it’s investments in collectable debt decreases, it’s future revenue takes a hit. For the forecasting of it’s future cashflows, we at first have to find out in what way todays investments will affect future earnings.

The price at which Encore bought debt in the last 3 years was on average 11,1% of it’s face value.

On average Encore has recovered $1,88 for every dollar it has ever invested in debt. 4-5 years after it’s purchase 80% of the estimated revenues are earned.

|Purchase Year|Collections / Estimated Collections|
|:-|:-|
|&lt;2012|98%|
|2012|97%|
|2013|92%|
|2014|93%|
|2015|91%|
|2016|87%|
|2017|80%|
|2018|74%|
|2019|60%|
|2020|45%|
|2021|12%|
|Total|82%|

**Table 1: Collected Recoveries divided by the estimated possible collections (in US)**

Collections in Europe go much slower as it took 4 years to earn 50% of the possible estimated collections. Should this improve, Encore cought see more rapid turnover.

To keep up it’s revenue Encore needs to maintain it’s purchasing volume. Quarterly purchases have started to decrease significantly in the last half of 2018. Only recently has there been an increase in the last quarter of 2021. Encore explaines that purchases are still under pre-pandemic level, which is caused by a shortage in supply. They also believe this shortage to be temporary as a result of the pandemic.

## Revenue Accounting

Understanding how Encore’s revenue is calculated important to understand the business. To put it simple: Encore invests in debt, which is written off immediately. Then it accounts the discounted estimated cashflows of that debt. Revenue gets earned as time passes and the discount on the assets decreases, which raises it’s present value. The company stated that the revenue can be simply calculated by multipling the portfolio balance with it’s Effective Interest Rate (EIR).

## Cost Structure

Encore’s cost structure is composed of wide variety of cost types:

* Salaries
* Cost of legal collections
* General and Admin
* Other operating expenses
* Collection agency commissions
* Depreciation &amp; Amortization

We will further analyse how they behave in relation to revenues.

|As % of Revenue|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|Average|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Salaries and employee benefits|27,3%|26,6%|27,8%|26,8%|25,2%|23,9%|26,3%|
|Cost of legal collections|19,5%|16,9%|15,5%|14,4%|15,9%|15,7%|16,3%|
|General and administrative|13,0%|13,3%|11,9%|10,5%|9,9%|8,5%|11,2%|
|Other operating|9,8%|8,8%|10,2%|7,7%|7,3%|6,6%|8,4%|
|Collection agency commissions|3,5%|3,7%|3,6%|4,5%|3,3%|2,9%|3,6%|
|Depreciation and amortization|3,4%|3,4%|3,1%|2,9%|2,8%|3,1%|3,1%|
|Total operating expenses|76,5%|72,7%|72,1%|67,7%|64,5%|60,8%|69,0%|
|Interest Expense|19,3%|17,2%|18,1%|15,5%|13,9%|10,5%|15,8%|

**Table 2: Costs as a % of revenue**

As revenue has risen, most costs have remained stable or only risen slightly. Still we will assume the operating margin to not improve any further and remain at the level of 2021 (40%).

## Industry Comparison

|Company|Encore|B2Holding (4)|Intrum (5)|PRA Group (6)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|D/E (Q1 2022)|2,7|2,1|2,6|2,3|
|EBIT / Interest Expense (Q1 2022)|7,7|2,3|3|3|
|Operating Margin|39%|41,5%|36%|34%|
|Return on Asset (EBIT / Assets)|13,7%|3,7%|7,3%|8,6%|
|Return on Equity|29,6%|11,5%|26%|13,8%|

**Table 3: Comparison of important ratios**

As interest expenses consume less of the operating income, Encore has been able to give itself an edge in terms of it’s return on assets and equity. The operating margin is in line with industry,

## Balance Sheet

## Debt Level

Encore Capital has used a portion of it’s cashflow to pay back some debt, which brings it back to the level of 2015. Meanwhile the equity has grew, decreasing the leverage of the company.

Until Q1 2022 interest expenses have eaten into the operating income of the company with a portion of 40%. That’s alarming, but as the company has increased earnings and decreased debt, the interest expenses are well covered by the companies operating income. A good edge for the company, if you look at the rest of the industry.

## Tangible Book Value

As most of the assets of Encore Capital are made up of investments in receivable portfolios, the determination of the real value of those assets is packed with giant amounts of uncertainty. In my opinion, there is no good base to make an accurate tangible book value calculation. If you take the audited equity at face value, that might at least help as a reference to keep in mind.

## Cashflow Statement

## Buybacks

Most cashflow has been invested in receivable portfolios. Only in the year ending in 2021, Encore has used lots of cash for buyback of over 20% of it’s shares. The company’s collections of receivable portfolios where much $400 million higher than purchases of new portfolios, which left Encore with lots of excess cash that couldn’t be invested into new receivables, as the supply has dried up. Regarding the low stock price, Encore has put it’s cash to good use with those significant stock buybacks. If the opportunity for heavy investments in receivables arises again, the buyback might become more of an exception than the norm.

## Recent investements in receivable portfolios

In the new Q-10, it’s stated that collections and purchases have balanced out a bit. As long as the company isn’t falling short on supply of receivables, it could be able to extend it’s business even further in the long-term. Until then, stock buybacks and debt repayment will be a good alternative in the short-term.

## Anomalies

||2015|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|2022 (Q1&amp;2)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|$1.161.572|$1.029.258|$1.187.038|$1.362.030|$1.405.789|$1.501.400|$1.614.499|$856.599|
|Operating Cashflow|$114.425|$130.332|$123.818|$186.791|$244.733|$312.864|$303.053|$98.530|
|Cashflow/Revenue|9,9%|12,7%|10,4%|13,7%|17,4%|20,8%|18,8%|11,5%|

**Table 4: Operating Cashflow in relation to revenues**

Large amounts of net income have been received through changes in recoveries. So we will take a look at cashflows in relation to revenue. As you can see that percentage varries greatly, even though revenue has grown steadily. Still it’s a valuable metric to see if our valuation model provides realistic cashflow numbers.

## Other points

## Insider Trading

Insider trading activity has been flat for the last 3 years, with no major purchases and some sales in the range of $60-$70 dollars per share. No good news to find here.

## Risks

* Delinquency rates and the size of the credit card debt burden are determining factors of the companies ability to grow or remain stable. If delinquency rates stay at an all-time low, revenues could stay flat or decrease for several years
* Encore’s collection activities are heavily dependant on legislation. Any disadvantagous legislation could damage the companies operating profit

## DCF

* Revenue Growth
   * For the past 5 years Encore’s revenue excluding changes in recoveries, has increased at an CAGR of 5%. As the supply of recoverable portfolios has been weak, I will consider an expansion at that rate at 5% as a best case
      * This could prove highly conservative, if Encore can expand it’s revenue through M&amp;A and an incresing market share
* Operating margin
   * The operating margin of 40% is the current margin of the company
      * 30% has been the average since 2016, which I will use as the bear case
* Interest Expenses
   * Interest Expenses have been declining relative to revenue, as revenue has grown and debt was retired
      * Encore’s target leverage lies between 2,5 and 3. So we will assume that interest expenses will continue to eat a portion of the operating profit
* Share repurchases
   * Actually if there isn’t enough supply of purchaseable portfolios, Encore could buy back more shares with the additional cash
   * So in the Bear Case the Share Repurchases should be slightly higher than in the Base Case
   * We will still use a low percentage as a depressed operating margin would result in lower cashflows

||Bear Case|Base Case|Best Case|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue Growth|0%|3%|5%|
|Operating margin|30%|40%|“”|
|Interest Expenses / Revenue|10%|“”|“”|
|Share Repurchases|3%|5%|6%|
|Taxrate|25%|“”|“”|
|Discount Rate|12%|10%|10%|

Global payments is a company that specializes in payments technology with software solutions. They are valued at 37.45 B. This company has posted ridiculously impressive and nearly secularly growing free cash flow over the past 5 years. Their current free cash flow yield is about 6.04%. 

When reading company filings I saw that they believe their full fiscal year earnings should be $9.51 compared to the $3.29 they reported last year. I expect this massive growth in earnings to be translated to a massive growth in free cash flow as there is not predicted high CAPEX even for this fiscal year. 

By simply growing the free cash flows at a terminal growth rate of 7% -8% the stock should be extremely conservatively worth 190 today. Furthermore, this 7%-8% growth is likely far lower than actually feasible growth rates as the eps will nearly triple just this year. This conservative price target of 190 implies an upside of 40%.

Looking at TLT this week, it didn't like what the Fed said even though the equity market did. 

If my base case is that the Fed will continue to push up rates past neutral even if they slow down how much they do it then can I expect TLT to keep going down?

Which is good, because their money is working. BUT! It can be a bit of a double-edged sword, because if a great opportunity comes up, you might not have enough freed up cash to fully capitalize on it.

What strategies do you guys follow to allow you to either stay partially liquid, or quickly free up cash, to be able to capitalize on opportunities like this?

1 - Sitting on pure cash? Just waiting for a good opportunity that might require you to move fast?

2 - Investing in something low-return but stable like bonds, so you're at least fighting inflation, but can cash out and dump that into your next opportunity? (I'm wondering if there might be tax penalties of some sort to this that could make this a bad play. Maybe depends on how you do it?)

3 - Finding another investment to sell off, if it's ""ripe"" and the timing seems good, to make a profit off of that, then reinvest that money into your next opportunity?

I don't understand it, but i'm looking for a very simple explanation of what he is on about (in terms of what the model is; is it futures?) and where this can be done online?

My personal experience of trading is very minimal and just involves buying/selling shares at listed prices and nothing more.

\-

*Basically, he said that apparently I can agree a price with a broker to pay X amount for a share in a certain time period. That time period comes and I can either pay the agreed X amount for the share (regardless of that share price at that time) or, pay the broker a small fee if I choose not to buy the share.*

*So, my friend plans on doing this\^ and hoping that certain shares will rise so he can buy them and pay X amounts and then sell them for profit. He thinks it is low risk, as if the shares aren't worth buying, then he will only have to pay the brokerage fee which is supposed to be very low.*

t3_wnd9fk|1660393286|investing|[Investment valuation, 3rd edition] Capitalizing R&amp;D costs and tax implications|"Hello fellow analysts,

I've been reading *Investment Valuation, 3rd edition* by *Aswath Damodaran* and just finished Chapter nine: *Measuring Earnings.* I found the concept of capitalizing R&amp;D costs, leases and advertisements instead of expensing them entirely in the current year quite practical, and I intend to use it in my own valuations. I could not, however, understand how the adjusted net income can end up devoid of tax implications.

In the book, prof. Damodaran has taken simple linear amortization of R&amp;D costs over a fixed period of time.  Thus, adjusted earnings are stated as :-

    Adj. Operating Income = Operating Income + R&amp;D expense - Amortization
    Adj. Net Income.      = Net income       + R&amp;D expense - Amortization 

He goes on to write about Adj. Net income,

&gt;While we would normally consider only the after-tax portion of this amount, the fact that R&amp;D is entirely tax deductible eliminates the need for this adjustment.  
&gt;  
&gt;If only amortization were tax deductible, the tax benefit from R&amp;D expenses would be:  
&gt;  
&gt;*Amortization x Tax rate*  
&gt;  
&gt;This extra tax benefit we get from the entire R&amp;D being tax deductible is as follows:  
&gt;  
&gt;*(R&amp;D - Amortization) x Tax rate*

If we subtract out *(R&amp;D – Amortization) x (1 – Tax rate)* and then add the differential tax benefit thatis computed above, *(1 – Tax rate)* drops out of the equation.

Its the tax elimination I'm struggling with.  My calculations (given below) just doesn't conform to this statement,

    Say,
       Gross income = Operating income + R&amp;D costs
    
    Net income       = (Gross income - R&amp;D costs)    x (1 - Tax rate)
    Adj. Net income  = (Gross income - Amortization) x (1 - Tax rate)
    
    Delta net income = Adj. Net income - Net income
                     = (Gross income - Amortization - Gross income + R&amp;D Costs) x (1 - Tax rate)
                     = (R&amp;D Costs - Amortization) x (1 - Tax rate)
    
    i.e Adj. Net income = Net income + (R&amp;D Costs - Amortization) x (1 - Tax rate)

As you see, change in net income is after-tax portion of net of R&amp;D expense and amortization. However, the book seems to ignore this tax differential.

The most relevant bits are :

ESG RATINGS:

&gt;Sustainalytics gives Tesla an ESG score of 28.6. It’s ranked 42 out of 83 in the automobiles sector, being beaten by the likes of Mercedes-Benz at 22.1 (lower being better).  
Why is this?  
[This article](https://www.grcworldforums.com/news-and-insight/teslas-low-esg-score-can-partly-be-explained-by-figure-skating/4101.article) published in February 2022 by the GRC World Forum suggests that the reason for the low ESG score is due to Elon Musk, or more accurately — the analysts opinions of Elon.  
The author notes:  
*For transparency, labor relations, adherence to governance, for example, having a CEO who doesn’t send out random tweets, Tesla scores poorly*  
*\[Tesla’s 2019 impact statement\] “was not exactly a statement that endeared Tesla to those who create ESG scores”*  
Musk is correct about the oil companies here, two oil companies ([OMV AG: 27.4](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/omv-ag/1008289354) and [Repsol: 26.4](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-rating/repsol-s-a/1008201748)) both have better scores than Tesla.  
The key problem here is that E,S and G are all weighted equally, while not close to being equal in practice. E can be quantified, while S and G are entirely subjective. The equal weighting of each metric means that companies outstanding in one area are beaten out by seemingly much worse companies overall because of the other two dimensions.  
The scores also don’t account for the wider impact that a company might have had, for example Tesla isn’t given get credit for helping to push other automakers towards EV’s. Regardless of how you feel about Tesla or Musk, it’s undeniable that had tesla not proved profitably and consumer demand, the EV market would not be as developed as it is today.  
This is most egregiously demonstrated by the fact that T[esla has been dropped from the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/18/why-tesla-was-kicked-out-of-the-sp-500s-esg-index.html) for concerns about their working environment after being sued in a racial discrimination lawsuit.  
You might agree that this is the correct course of action, if so, you will also likely agree that Amazon should be dropped after being sued for telling it’s employees to work through a severe weather warning, [resulting in six of them being killed after the building was hit by a tornado](https://ca.movies.yahoo.com/amazon-sued-by-family-of-employee-killed-in-warehouse-tornado-collapse-085656743.html), yet amazon remains the funds third largest holding.  
You might also disagree that Nestle, a company that was sued earlier in the year for [profiting from child slavery](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/business/hershey-nestle-mars-chocolate-child-labor-west-africa/) be given a 4.9 rating by FTSERussel and subsequently included in the [FTSE4Good Index](https://www.nestle.com/ask-nestle/health-nutrition/answers/what-is-ftse4good)  
[This study from MIT Sloan](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-mit-sloan-study-discovers-widespread-and-repeated-retroactive-changes-to-esg-scores-301576360.html) shows that there are “widespread and repeated” retroactive changes to ESG scores by ESG ratings agencies in order to establish this relationship.  
*He explains that the data for any specific point in time should remain the same for a firm unless there is a documented reason for a retroactive change. However, their study revealed significant unannounced and unexplained changes to the data provided by* [*Refinitive ESG*](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3579819-1&amp;h=2880314828&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.refinitiv.com%2Fen%2Ffinancial-data%2Fcompany-data%2Fesg-data&amp;a=Refinitive+ESG)*, which was previously owned by Thomson Reuters. For example, looking at two versions of the same Refinitive ESG data for identical firm years — one from September 2018 and the other from September 2020 — the median overall scores in the rewritten data were 18% lower than in the initial data.*  
*He notes that the data rewriting occurs on an ongoing basis without any public announcements. To show this, the researchers compared ESG scores from February 9 and March 23, 2021 — just six weeks apart — and found that 85% of firms’ scores changed. While the score changes were mostly small in magnitude, the ongoing retroactive changes affected the classification of firms and the link between ESG scores and returns.*  
*Using predictive regressions, they showed that investing in firms with higher ESG scores in the initial data would not have led to economically or statistically significant performance gains. Yet, in the rewritten data, they found economically large, statistically significant positive effects of the E&amp;S score on the firm’s future stock returns. These large differences matter because this performance would not have been possible with the data available to investors when forming their investment strategies.*

ESG FUNDS:

&gt;*Sector exposures across the funds revealed that information technology was the largest allocation in most funds, and an almost zero allocation in energy. This was one of the key drivers behind the shorter-term recent outperformance of ESG funds relative to their non-ESG counterparts, as tech stocks rallied in 2020 whilst energy declined.*  
So the overperformance of ESG funds compared to a wide index was because they are tech heavy.  
*Google was the most commonly held stock across most funds; Alphabet Inc. was in 12 funds, with an average weight of 1.9% . The companies with the highest average weight across the funds were Apple (5.6%) and Microsoft (5.0%)*  
So ESG funds are basically investing in the same things that most other funds do: Tech (FAANG) and industrials, with very little, if any allocation towards energy. This is permissible by their rules because all of these companies have good ESG scores. Afterall their CEO’s don’t tweet.  
&gt;  
&gt;The easy accessibility of financial knowledge on the internet has allowed retail investors to learn that [actively managed funds mostly underperform passive index funds.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/27/new-report-finds-almost-80percent-of-active-fund-managers-are-falling-behind.html)  
[Prevailing wisdom for the last decade has been for investors to consistently buy the index.](https://www.silverlightinvest.com/blog/why-warren-buffett-making-argument-passive-investing)  
The has meant the last decade has seen a steady increase in capital away from actively managed funds and into passive index funds and ETF’s:  
The assets of equity index funds surpassed [actively managed funds in 2019](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2019/09/20/passive-overtakes-active-in-us-stock-fund-assets-morningstar/).  
[Largely driven by younger (millennial and gen z) investors](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/12/154901-millennials-are-increasingly-investing-in-exchange-traded-funds-and-cash-compared-to-all-other-generations-charles-schwabs-report-reveals/), who don’t want to pay fees for below market returns.  
The prospects for fund managers being able to attract young investors were not looking particularly positive until they found a new target:  
The Socially Conscious Investor.  
ESG funds are largely investing in the same ways that ‘standard’ funds do. This is allowed because the structuring of the ESG metric and the altering of data by ESG ratings agencies means that fund managers are able to invest in whatever they would like.  
If the ESG rating of one provider doesn’t allow them to invest in the way they would like — they can simply choose another that does.  
&gt;  
&gt;The entire point of third party ratings is that the average investor doesn't have to concern themselves with it. The judgments are abstracted away from them.  
Which is probably why most of the money flowing into ESG is going into active funds:  
&gt;  
&gt;Actively managed funds, and their fund managers salaries were being threatened by younger, savvy investors that might have otherwise invested into a passive index funds.  
These funds have figured out a way to not only bring younger investors on board, but also charge an [average 43% higher fee for ESG funds than for regular funds.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tidal-wave-of-esg-funds-brings-profit-to-wall-street-11615887004) It would be a very impressive feat of marketing if it wasn’t so deceptive.  
I’m an ethically-minded millennial investor. Instead of investing in an ESG fund I'm going with the optimal investment method of consistently buying into a passive index and then donating a portion of my gains to charity.  
I’ll do more good for the world and I'll keep my money out of the hands of scammers and thieves."|0.89|891|0|891

t3_wmn6ow|1660315889|investing|I bought Movado. How and Why?|"**Introduction**

I was recently blessed when my holdings in Ocean Bio-Chem (DL: $OBCI) were bought out by One Water Marine (NASDAQ: $ONEW) for $13.08/share.  That gave me a nice 40%+ return.  The question was how to put that money into good use in the small cap growth space. To my surprise, I found Movado Group Inc (NYSE: $MOV). The reason I said I was surprised was because it has a current yield (TTM) of 3.85%, which would make it more of a dividend play.

**About Movado Group**

Movado Group, Inc. designs, sources, markets, and distributes watches worldwide. The company operates in two segments, Watch and Accessory Brands, and Company Stores. It offers its watches under the Movado, Concord, Ebel, Olivia Burton, and MVMT brands, as well as licensed brands, such as Coach, Tommy Hilfiger, HUGO BOSS, Lacoste, Calvin Klein, and Scuderia Ferrari. The company also provides after-sales and shipping services. Its customers include jewelry store chains, department stores, independent regional jewelers, network of independent distributors, online marketplaces, licensors' retail stores, and third-party e-commerce retailers. The company also sells directly to consumers through its e-commerce platforms. As of January 31, 2022, it operated 51 retail outlet locations. The company was formerly known as North American Watch Corporation and changed its name to Movado Group, Inc. in 1996. Movado Group, Inc. was founded in 1961 and is based in Paramus, New Jersey.

**Key Statistics**

* Price = $36.19/share
* 52 Week Range = $29.95 - $48.66
* Market Cap = $832.873M
* Beta = 1.16
* PE Ratio = 8.53
* PS Ratio = 1.13
* Dividend Yield = 3.85%

**Financial Health**

Before I look at any company, there is the issue of the financial health of the business. I have several non-negotiables when it comes to investing, and I always insist on a clean balance sheet. Here are a few measures that lead one to believe that Movado is a well run company.

* Altman-Z score = 4.87
* Beneish M-Score = -2.66
* Debt-to-Equity = 0.19
* Current Ratio = 3.79
* Quick Ratio = 2.59
* Free Cash Flow = $118.50M
* Source: Financial Statements from Movado

**Growth Prospects**

Movado offers watches for $100 up to $10,000 per piece.  For some younger people, their brands are the first luxury watch they buy. The company continues to offer these various price points so no one can feel left out.  Their smartwatch technology continues to improve, so they will have a presence in that space too.  Based on historical trends, these are the regressed growth rates:

* Sales Growth = 18.94%
* EPS Growth = 67.97%
* Dividend Growth = 17.3%

Since the EPS Growth, along with the historical PE ratios, are skewed due to Covid-19, it is decided to determine a fair price for Movado based on revenue growth.  Additionally, since the thesis is to focus on Movado as a growth prospect, I will sparingly use a dividend model for my evaluation

**Cash Flow Analysis Based on Sales Growth**

Here are the numbers that I will use determine a fair price for Movado:

* Sales Growth 18.94%
* PS Low = 0.39
* PS High = 2.00
* PS Average = 1.12
* Revenue/Share = $32.86
* Historical Beta = 0.99
* Required Rate of Return = 9.95%

Using these metrics, a fair present value just based on sales for Movado would range between $18.98-$97.36, with an average of $54.52. Given its current price, Movado is clearly undervalued.

**Cash Flow Analysis Based on Dividend Growth**

Given that Movado's dividend growth of 17.3% (ignoring 2020) is well above the required rate of return of 9.95%, I used a valuation for supernormal growth rates.  I come up with a present value of $36.89/share, which puts Movado as a fairly priced security based on its historical yield.

**How I Played Movado**

I bought 150 shares of Movado at $36.53/share.  Additionally, I sold a December Call with a strike price of $40 for a profit of $2.90/share. If Movado hits the strike price of $40 in December, I will have a total profit of $6.37/share for one round lot, and a profit margin of 17.4%. As long as the price remains above $34.60/share, I will remain profitable, and that doesn't take into account the $1.40/share annual dividend that stands to grow.

Tiger 21 consists of 1,200 members with a cumulative $140 billion in assets, and individuals must have at least $20 million in liquid assets to qualify for membership.

Its founder and chairman, Michael Sonnenfeldt, told CNBC on Thursday that although real estate had historically been the most popular destination for members’ money, they were now seeing some “real bargains” in the stock markets.

This has, in part, pushed public equities to the No. 1 spot for Tiger 21 for the first time since the network’s inception.

Sonnenfeldt said members are not focused on stock picking for the most part, so much of the equity investment is channeled into ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and index trackers, while technology has been among the most popular sectors. Public equities now constitute 27% of the membership’s overall asset allocation.

“You have a lot of the FAANGs that have come in from much higher prices — they are thinking there is a lot of benefit there, and obviously one of the big areas is energy, not only on the oil and gas side, but much bigger growing interest in renewables and how to play the solar opportunities, the wind opportunities,” Sonnenfeldt told CNBC’s “Street Signs Europe.”

“They know this is the biggest investment theme perhaps in human history, and it is getting a lot of their attention.”

After a dismal first half of the year on the back of soaring inflation, tightening monetary policy and recession fears, stock markets have staged a relief rally in recent weeks, and received a further boost Wednesday after U.S. inflation was shown to have cooled in July on the back of a fall in oil prices.

Many investors have increased their cash holdings to weather a likely recession. Sonnenfeldt said the cash allocation of Tiger 21 members has historically held solid at an unusually high 12%.

This is because they are primarily “wealth preservers” who have sold businesses and live on roughly 2% of their net worth, and therefore use cash reserves to shore up around five years of living expenses, he said.

In the short term, Tiger 21 noted that members are using their ample cash to look for deals and inflation hedges.

“But they also want resources to pounce on an opportunity and they have been seeing them in increasing numbers, so their cash actually just ticked down from 12% to 11%. It may sound like a small amount, but it probably suggests that members are quite bullish over the long term,” Sonnenfeldt said.

“They have recession fears — a majority of our members think that we are going into recession — and still between real estate, public equity and private equity, it is a 76% allocation, so that is pretty confident in the long term.”"|0.48|0|0|0

t3_wmd4ay|1660282421|investing|Investment DISCUSSION: Aluminium|" Hi,

Not an investment recommendation or advice, just some conversation. I am a Macro geek but not so much a stock picker..

Aluminium market is in structurally in deficit as demand has been above production. It already was the case in 2021 and is expected to be the case in 2022, 23, 24, 25 and going forward. In addition, LME stocks are at the lowest level since 2000... 

Recession is coming, according to most experts. I don't challenge the rational, but it seems to be quite priced in commodity markets and economy is not a science (in other terms, there is no determinism like in physics and they could be 'very' wrong). 

Aluminium production is energy intensive: it is estimated (by legitimate banks) that the median cost of production lies at $2,300. Current price is $2,500. The 50% median cost has historically acted as a support to the Al price. 

The median cost is that high because of the energy cost (Aluminium smelting is extremely energy intensive), and I expect (personal view) energy costs to remain elevated in Europe. At current prices, a large part of the production (already in deficit) is at made at a loss. In consequence, more production will be curtailed, and the deficit should worsen. In Europe, electricity prices went up 10-20 fold! (Realize that...) Even Alcoa has some plants producing at a loss, there is no interest for them to feed the market with more supply at a loss, generating a local loss and lower prices globally. 

CONCLUSION:

Supply-Demand rebalance should lead to higher prices. European smelters should be the first to cut production leading to higher prices. American smelters should benefit from higher prices, relative lower costs: Higher margins. 

CAVEAT

There are large regional premiums that bump the price (+$600 in the US, +$550 in Europe). It could also be seen as physical market tightness. 

TANGIBLE MARKET IDEA FOR DISCUSSION Just in case the Market has its pricing correct (recession), I prefer to play it in equities, either outright or medium/LT out the money calls.

Century Aluminium (CENX) is an American Smelter. Despite high energy costs, it should do better than its European peers. It is currently trading at $10, after a recent low of $7. In Q2, volume disappointed but it generates solid net income after several years of loss. To be clear, the company was in bad situation, but if the market behaves (my thesis above) the stock would move from a ""distressed sort of company valuation"" to a cash maker value stock. 

HONNEST ACKOWLEDGMENTS: I am more of a Macro guy and less of a Stock expert. I am seeking advice here as CENX shut down one location in the US due to high Energy costs (still, it has recently generated profits as a company and is compatible with all the above). But: 1) why have they shut down a US plant before the numerous cash burners in Europe? (Maybe hedging makes some Euro company still profitable, but this would be temporary) 

2) Do you see another company in a better position to benefit from this environment?

The cheapest and easiest way to leverage you exposure to the stock market is to buy deep in the money call LEAPS.

However, I'm not too familiar with options (even though I have been investing for years, just never bothered with reading up on derivatives much).

I wish to only maintain 2X exposure to the S&amp;P 500 when it is above say a 200 day moving average (for example). When S&amp;P 500 drops below that SMA, move to government bonds (unlevered). Then get back in the market with 2X leverage again when S&amp;P 500 moves above 200 day SMA again. 

How exactly would I carry this out in practice? I am not sure if it is as simple as buying the LEAP call when going long the market and then selling it when going to bonds. Besides, wouldn't the bid-ask spreads eat me alive? Would I have to keep rolling the option contract to maintain a 12 month time to maturity or something (as I remember options behave differently as their time to expiry decreases)?

For example, it may take the form of a [mutual fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) or exchange-traded fund (ETF), a [real estate investment trust](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp) (REIT), or a [unit investment trust](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uit.asp)  (UIT). Whichever form the RIC assumes, the structure must be deemed  eligible by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to pass through taxes for  capital gains, dividends, or interest earned to the individual  investors. 

A regulated investment company is qualified to pass-through income under Regulation M of the [IRS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp),  with the specific regulations for qualifying as an RIC delineated in  U.S. code, title 26, sections 851 through 855, 860, and 4982. 

## Regulated Investment Company (RIC) Basics  

The purpose of utilizing pass-through or flow-through income is to avoid  a double-taxation scenario as would be the case if both the investment  company and its investors paid tax on company generated income and  profits. The concept of pass-through income is also referred to as the [conduit theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conduittheory.asp),  as the investment company is functioning as a conduit for passing on  capital gains, dividends and interest to individual shareholders. 

 Requirements to Qualify as an RIC  

To qualify as a regulated investment company the business has to meet specific perimeters. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Exist as a corporation, or other entity, which would ordinarily have taxes assessed as a corporation.
2. Be registered as an investment company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
3. Elect to be deemed as an RIC by the [Investment Company Act of 1940](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentcompanyact.asp) as long as its income source and diversification of assets meets specified requirements.

Additionally, an RIC must derive a minimum of 90% of its income from  capital gains, interest or dividends earned on investments. Further, an  RIC must distribute a minimum of 90% of its [net investment income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uit.asp)  in the form of interest, dividends or capital gains to its  shareholders. Should the RIC not distribute this share of income, it may  be subject to an [excise tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentcompany.asp) by the IRS."|0.57|1|0|1

1. Am I misunderstanding something here, if the SP goes up 10%, my SP500 fund should go up 10% right? Or is it expected to be less than that due to fees, or more than that due to dividend?
2. What's a more standard allocation than what I have right now? I don't see the point of the 30% in mid/small caps. It seems the downside doesn't justify the benefit of diversification.

Separately, I have $200K worth of a fund, and given the stock market, has been slightly down. I want to close that position, in case there is further drop in the market in next 3-9 months.

So it seems like a good option to put all of that 200K into i-bonds to get \~9% returns of the next year.

I read in subreddits that I can buy for future years, and still make \~9% return this year.  

So, the questions are:

1. is it possible to make 6 years worth of contributions?

[Waiting for the Market to Crash is a Terrible Strategy](https://svrn.co/blog/2017/5/14/waiting-for-the-market-to-crash-is-a-terrible-strategy)

&gt;Second, the market tended to exhibit momentum more than mean reversion over years-long horizons. **As strange as it sounds, you would have been better off buying when the market was going up and selling when it was going down**, using a trend-following rule. 

This quote reminded me of a 2020 piece from JP Morgan Wealth about investing at all-time highs. [This is the PDF](https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm/securities/documents/cwm-documents/Is-it-worth-considering-investing-at-all-time-highs.pdf) and the relevant section starts at the bottom of page 3. And here is [a summary of it from some dude's LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/should-you-invest-when-stock-market-all-time-high-monik-kotecha/). 

&gt;If you **invested in the S&amp;P 500 on any random day since the start of 1988 and reinvested all dividends**, your investment made money over the course of the next year 83% of the time. **On average, your one-year total return was +11.7%**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, what do those figures look like if we **only consider investments on days when the S&amp;P 500 closed at an all-time high? They’re actually better!** Your investment made money over the course of the next year 88% of the time, and **your average total return was +14.6%**.

With crash calling and correction calling, you have to make two correct market timing calls in a row. When to sell and when to buy back in. I know I can't do that.

The other issue with waiting for a large correction is when it finally occurs, the people that were waiting will be fearful of the market dropping further and won't put capital to work when they said they would. It's more likely they'll wait until things improve which means the market has already recovered."|0.86|402|0|402
t3_wl2epo|1660150247|investing|The story of 4 friends saving for retirement (with customisable Google Sheet)|"You may have come across this story or versions of it before but I've tried to add a bit of a different spin and have also created a customisable Google Sheet for you to adapt any numbers to suit your own circumstances ([Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1330cHaqjU3h3DCUU2Q4UQs1YFy3BW2iRqqxNUCCQL-o/edit?usp=sharing))

📖 Story Time (Yay)!
This is my favourite investing related story of all time. It's the story of 4 friends who are 65 and about to retire. And for the past 45 years they were each able to save £50 a month.

3 of them invested into the S&amp;P 500🇺🇸, while the 4th friend just saved their money in the bank. So they were all:

👴 the same age
💵saved the same amount
⌚over the same 45 years
📈into the same investment

But they each now have a very different account balance, and that's because the only difference was in their approach to saving and investing, how they actually did it.

Now of course they couldn’t predict the future, but they knew 45 years in the stock market wouldn't all be plain sailing. And sure enough, it wasn't. There were actually 5 main market crashes during their 45 year investment (Black Tuesday in 1987, the Kuwait War in 1990, the dot-com crash starting in 2000, the global financial crisis in 2008, and most recently, the market crash caused by COVID in 2020).

🤦‍♀️ Sally
Sally hated investing, she thought it was scary, risk and only for the rich. So she saved her £50/month into a savings account paying her 3%/year. 

After 45 years, she's ready to retire and has a pot of £57,019 to show for her efforts.

🙍‍♀️ Alice
Her friend Alice, put her £50/month into the same 3% savings account, until she picked her moment to invest, as she wanted to avoid any market crashes. So when she thought it was a good time to invest, she took all the money she had saved up in her savings account and invested it. And then continued saving her £50 into her savings account until again she thought the time was right. 

However, she wasn’t very good at timing the market. She was actually terrible, as bad as you could be. She invested 5 times during the 45 year period, each time investing right before the 5 main crashes.

But even despite having the worlds worst timing, she still ended up with £309,297. 

💁‍♂️ Pete
Pete took the exact same approach as Alice, but only had the world's best timing. He invested at the market bottom, right after each market crash.

Of course being the perfect investor it served Pete very well, he ended up with 44% more than Alice, with £444,865. 

🧘 Charlie
The last friend, Charlie, took a different approach to all his friends. He didn't care about timing, reading the news, keeping up to date with the stock market, and prices. 

He set-up a regular monthly savings plan into his account of £50, and never looked at it again. That means that every month £50 would come out his account automatically, and be invested at whatever the price was on that day.

And he ended up with........ £735,720! 

🥡 Key Takeaways

1️⃣ Literally doing nothing, the most simple strategy of the 3, made way more than timing the market to perfection (65% to be precise), which is impossible to do consistently anyway.
2️⃣Channel your inner consistent Charlie
3️⃣Ask yourself, does investing have to be complex?"|0.64|80|0|80

There are some that went through GFC without ever slashing their divvies. Of course that is survivorship bias, however I believe the company that goes through GFC unscathed is well run and has already been through the toughest experience. A lot of funds also belong to Allianz/Pimco that is 4th or 5th largest asset manager in the world so they must very knowledgeable in the world of fixed income. A lot of these funds will yield 10% or more percent right now. I’m not from USA so I pay 30% withholding tax so can expect a yield of 7% and IBKR offers 3.83% margin rate, meaning the divvies more than cover my margin payments and actually make it a profitable trade. The biggest issue I can see is that although divvies are stable the price can fluctuate a lot which means I can get margin called so that is something that needs to be managed. Otherwise, if I get a large diversified basket of CEFs, is the risk not minimal? Although the level of diversification is questionable because there’s a huge overlap (many of these CEFs will be trading same bonds on leverage)

However, it has recently bounced off a demand zone from the previous low and is looking to bounce back. It is also reaching the top of a parallel channel, and a penetration through may signal bullish sentiment. It is also oversold on the H1-H4 timeframes.

https://imgur.com/a/tEpawRU

Disney's revenue is seasonal, its main revenue source being its linear networks and their parks and attractions play a part too. Approaching summer, there will be higher userbases on Disney's networks including Disney+, which should increase revenue. Similarly, Disney parks and attractions should be experiencing higher visitors as summer rolls in and children finish their academic year, especially as Disneylands are opening up (e.g. Shanghai re-opened their Disneyland in June as COVID restrictions loosened). New Disneyland rides could help with visitor attraction also.

Disney+ is also a big source of revenue for Disney. In the past few quarters, it has been experiencing increasing subscriptions at a steady rate. It also has been offered in 16 more countries in the past quarter. Furthermore, rival Netflix has experiences a loss in userbase for the first time recently, which could boost Disney's revenue further.

I also think Disney is a good long term play in general, with its quarterly debt to asset ratios dropping. Will be looking for few month play on Disney, and this earnings report acting as a catalyst to catapult the stock upwards.

To make a long story short - a bunch of relatives have posed the suggestion of going in as a group on a rental property in a different country. Mind you, it is only a 5 hour drive; however, we would need to cross the border to get there and there are different laws, not to mention a different currency that’s involved in this decision. Their argument is that the property is inexpensive compared to where we live, and 3/4 units are currently already occupied.

So I’m posting in here to ask those of you who are more knowledgeable on the subject if I’m just being a worry wart or if this is a potentially very bad idea that has risks that outweigh the benefits?

In detail, it's like SNAP puts at around strike $30 that expire Jan/23 and EWZ puts at $37 that expire in Sep/22. Normally speaking, it would be better to sell those puts on the open market for money since you can monetize both the intrinsic &amp; extrinsic values of the option. Executing early wipes out the extrinsic value.

So why would they want to exercise rather than sell the option? 

Maybe they want the cash right now and/or have trouble selling those options? Maybe it's a whale that wanted to add buy/sell pressure on a stock? Maybe it has something to do with the underlying securities or market vol?

History suggests to buy.|"**TL;DR**: Value stocks are calling out for your attention. The value spread is at historically favorable levels (for value stocks), and this predicts strong future earnings relative to growth.

Not since the Dot Com era have we seen value stocks spreading themselves so enticingly.

What is the value spread? Definitions abound, but in general, it measures the relative cheapness of value stocks to growth stocks. For example, one might compare the E/P of value stocks to E/P of growth stocks (the inverse of the P/E ratio). More complex frameworks include metrics such as book/price, forecasted earnings to price, etc. 

But value stocks are cheap for a reason, you say. The literature comes to the rescue: there have been numerous empirical studies verifying that periods of outperformance follow relatively cheap periods. Much as heightened values of the Shiller P/E ratio tends to forecast poor returns, historically cheap value stocks forecast great returns. This phenomenon is pronounced for small cap value.

In fact, simple mean reversion implies large premiums:

&gt; Value stocks look like a heck of a value right now! Look at it this way. As of yesterday, value stocks have a forward P/E of 13.4, against growth stocks at 22.4. The ratio is 0.57. To get back to the historical average ratio of 0.75, and assuming stable earnings, value stocks would have to rise by about 30 per cent, or growth stocks would have to fall by over 20 per cent, or some combination of both. A little mean reversion here would mean a lot of outperformance for value.

Let's now present some graphs. From AQR capital, a normalized value spread measure the last few decades: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/PzKHi5Q.png). Here higher is cheaper value. They use a complex mixture to compute valuation, described in their [blog posts](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/Is-Systematic-Value-Investing-Dead).

From the FT, a simpler graph of price/earnings: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/nz83cmC.png). Note that here 'lower' is cheaper since they use P/E instead of E/P.

This phenomenon is robust across the world: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/ytkZewM.png). In fact, the cheapness is even more extreme than Europe: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/P3nudFF.png). An [FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/a841583e-4ea7-4ff6-b673-ece22b72f100) explains just how remarkable this is:

&gt; Arnold also writes “value stocks in Europe are currently trading on lower PEs than they were five years ago . . . there are very few, if any, parts of developed market equities that the market is so pessimistic about that they’ve actually de-rated over the last five years.”

&gt; On top of the gap between the valuation of European growth and value, there is the gap between US value and European value: “The Russell 1000 value index is a 16.5 forward PE, while the equivalent in Europe is on 11, an enormous differential in its own right. A cheap stock in the US is held in much higher regard than a cheap stock in Europe. Value stocks in Europe are the unloved of the unloved!”
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, Arnold writes that “over the last five years Europe’s cheapest companies have delivered more profit growth than their growth counterparts . . . so over that 5 year period the real growth stocks in Europe, in terms of fundamentals anyway, have been the value stocks!” 


Growth has been impressive the past decade, as [Larry Swedroe writes](https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/is-small-cap-value-dead/), both in returns and fundamentals. But value stocks has done well for itself, fundamentally.

&gt; While it is true that earnings of large growth stocks have grown faster than earnings of small-cap value stocks — Avantis estimated that large growth earnings grew by approximately 194 percent between January 2010 and July 2021 versus an earnings increase of 177 percent for small value stocks — the differential was less than 2 percent per year. That differential is a lot smaller than what would have been the expected differential, and certainly cannot explain the fact that the return to large growth stocks was 492 percent versus the 181 percent return to small value stocks over that same period.

Swedroe gives a short literature review on the evidence that this spread predicts returns.  For example,

&gt; Adam Zaremba and Mehmet Umutlu, authors of the March 2019 study Strategies Can Be Expensive Too! The Value Spread and Asset Allocation in Global Equity Markets, examined whether the value spread (the difference in valuation ratios between the long and the short sides of the trade) was useful for forecasting returns on quantitative equity strategies for country selection. To test this, they examined a sample of 120 country-level equity strategies replicated within 72 stock markets for the years 1996 through 2017.

&gt; They found: “The breadth of the value spread can predict the future returns in the cross-section. We show that equity strategies with a wide value spread markedly outperform strategies with a narrow value spread. In other words, if you wonder which strategy might produce decent payoffs in the future, pay attention to the value spread.”

Mean reversion alone predicts strong outperformance, but it is comforting to have empirical evidence across the world verifying that this mean reversion will probably happen.

This cheapness won't last forever, if history is to repeat itself. Eventually, money will flows into such unappreciated value, with strong fundamentals. The time to sin a little and market time is now. Thus, I conclude with a recommendation to buy small cap value ETFs, where the premiums are even higher.

t3_wjlhrz|1659995974|investing|Are margin loans a better means of attaining leverage than LEAPS?|"I am using the ""Lifecycle Investing"" strategy proposed by Barry Nalebuff and Ian Ayres in their book of the same name, which states that one should use 2:1 leverage for the first few years of their career as a long term investment strategy. The way they suggest doing this is by buying index funds like SPY with margin loans and LEAPS, among other means. I am currently trying to determine which of the first two is the better option by calculating which of those two would require the lowest stock price change to break even.

Let's say I had $10,000, and I put it in SPY with no leverage. Since SPY has a 30-day yield of 1.42, we may assume that the dividend returns would be 1.42% over then next year, so the stock price could fall by 100-100×(1/1.0142)=1.4% (-1.4% change) and you would still break even because of the dividend. Since I use robinhood (pls don't hate), if I want to use 2:1 leverage through margin loans, I can borrow $10,000 to buy SPY, on top of the $10,000 I own with my money. The margin interest rate is 5% right now, which is calculated by adding 2.5% to the target federal funds rate, which will also go up to decrease inflation. Assuming it stays the same however, the price change for SPY to reach break-even with margin loans, would be (5-(2x1.42))/2=1.08%. I pretty much took the interest rate, subtracted from it the 30-day yield times 2, because now we get twice as many dividends because we have twice as many shares, and then divided that result by 2 because we also get double the gains for the same change in price. Furthermore, we can also attain 2:1 leverage by buying a $205 9/23 SPY Call. SPY is currently priced at $413, and that call's ask price is $214, meaning that SPY's break-even price change in this case would be ((205+214)/413-1)×100=1.45%. Since you miss out on dividends with calls, we don't need to consider them here.

According to my methodology, and please correct  me if it is wrong, margin loans appear to be the superior option, especially for someone like me who is young and has a smaller account. The margin interest rate would need to go up by another .74% for the margin loan approach to have the same break-even point as the LEAP approach. You might say that's likely to happen given more future rate hikes by the federal reserve. But even then, each one of those calls costs $21,400, and thus this approach requires at least that much money, if not way more, to successfully implement. Finally, as prices fluctuate, your leverage will too. If I used the margin loan approach mentioned earlier and SPY fell by 25%, I would end up with $15,000 worth of SPY shares. Since I have $10,000 in loans, of that $15,000, only $5,000 would be mine, and therefore I would have 3:1 leverage. I would thus need to rebalance by selling stock to pay off my loans as the price goes down, and take out loans to buy more stock as the price goes up, to retain 2:1 leverage. The LEAP approach also requires rebalancing, but since each LEAP is ~$20K, you would actually need a lot more money than that to rebalance. Are there any factors that I have overlooked, or is the margin approach simply better?"|0.67|18|0|18

If a company buys back say 30% of its share and destroys them (reducing the number of outstanding shares), it’s clear that the dividends to be distributed will simply go up for shareholders (100% of dividends divided by 70% of outstanding shares).

From Forbes .com/advisor/investing/stock-buyback/

“It’s important to understand that once a company has bought back its own shares, they are either canceled—thereby permanently reducing the number of shares outstanding—or held by the company as treasury shares. These are not counted as shares outstanding, which has implications for many important measures of a company’s financial fundamentals.”

2. What about company shares that are bought back and kept as treasury shares in the company’s books? Do the company shares get paid the dividend as well? Because if so, it seems like it just means, eg. If the company has 30% of its own shares, then the dividend is 100% divided by 70% of the outstanding shares? Or is it 70% of dividends divided by 70% of the outstanding shares?

Edit: it’s a simple question, I’m asking if you have $1000 to give out as dividend, would shareholders get $1000 divided by outstanding shares, or would they get $1000 divided by ALL shares."|0.6|3|0|3

Only the Household Survey data reports the breakdown between part-time and full-time is only reported in the Household Survey pages (pages 13-41). The Household Survey is how we determine the national unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate among other stats.

There is a different sample population (Household is bigger N, Establishment is smaller) and some differences between how people are counted in each survey. For example, if someone works multiple jobs they appear multiple times in Establishment but only once in Household. If someone is self-employed they appear in Household but not Establishment. Household counts self-employed but total Total Nonfarm Payroll was 152,536k for Establishment and employed Civilian labor force was 158,290k for Household.

So the numbers are a little off because the data sets are different even though both are published in the same report by the BLS."|0.89|1751|0|1751

t3_whh7r0|1659766319|investing|The best stocks or sector ETF's to own during rising rates?|"Tldr; I just want to know your top ETF's stocks you have bought for the rising rate environment and why? (Below is my just my current reasoning as well as some of my favorite)  


I've recently rebalanced my 401k to be pretty diversified into ETF's and am looking to increase my exposure in my retail account to single stocks, I've bought plenty of tech stocks over the last few years and sold them off during the fall of 2021. I'm very bullish on tech but I don't want to make the mistake of exposing myself heavily in the event the economy falters in 2023/24 due to interest rates causing a housing crash/recession. Everyone and their mom's have a different feeling on where the economy is heading, but for my own sake I try to stick with the most reliable info, and that as of right now is that rates will go up, probably beyond 3%, and the most recent job numbers seem to give the Fed reason to do so, but that is always changing. I also know that the issues with China's economy, Covid/MP, Supply chains, Capex and Europe all are things to consider but those are things I feel have less certainty to them.  


So my question is what stocks (individual or sector based ETF's do you believe will perform within the next 2-3 years as rates rise to 3%+?  


I've done some research about this recently and I feel Silvergate Capital is a really strong play on rates increasing as well as a pretty affordable P/E, also I am bullish on crypto so this makes sense to my values as well as generally doing well within the space with positive cash flow  


My second pick would be Wells Fargo or XLF if you want broad based diversification, obviously Financials do very well with rate hikes, and with the most recent job number it seems that the economy (for now) is strong enough to support a rate hike. I think Wells Fargo is in the best position to benefit from hikes than other banks, most notably BAC.  


My third pick would be a suite of DSF, Mastercard and Visa because obviously they do better when prices are higher (inflation), they also benefit from higher rates with outstanding balances and have performed very well in the recent years, the P/E's are a little high but I feel these stocks long term are pretty standard to have in any portfolio.  


My last few notable mentions are ones I also plan on picking up but are most hedges than anything, but I still feel will do will in the current environment. To hedge any upcoming wars or further aggression as well as a rebound in the aerospace/flight markets I would buy Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Boeing.   


To hedge against recession risk I plan on buying SLV (Tracks price of silver) and GDX (Gold Miners ETF), along with UNH stock, which provides a healthy dividend and has very strong financials.  


My asset mix would probably be as such 55% Financials, 15% Defense/Aero, 20% Precious Metals, 10% Healthcare (UNH)  


10% In Wells Fargo, 10% XLF 20% Financials

5% DSF 12.5% Visa 12.5% Mastercard 30% Financials - Consumer Credit

5% Silvergate Capital, this carries the highest risk in my opinion, but I'm bullish on crypto and this stock is set to gain 16m/year income for every quarter point rate increase and it cash flow postive.  


5% BA, 5% Raytheon, 5% Lockheed Martin 15% Defense/Aerospace  


10% SLV, 10% GDX - 20% - Precious Metals/Commodities  


10% UNH stock - Healthcare  


After doing a lot of research over the last couple weeks and months I've found myself feeling pretty optimistic and pessimistic about the market, I thought about whether my favorite sector of the market, technology would be going up or down, but time and time again I find myself questioning the global political risks, inflation, and interest rates weighing on the housing market and growth stocks. I couldn't find a way to position my money into individual stocks. I recently bought AMD at 77 and sold for 97\~ a share, after being idiotic about my Roth IRA. I do want to take advantage of the one thing I know for sure will be happening, and I don't want to overshadow my decisions because of greed or fear, I want to make decisions based off a trajectory that's most certain. This portfolio is built under the assumption that rates will rise and that in the event of a recession I will have hedged against my losses, as well as adding defensive stock like LHM, RTX and Boeing, which I think will have always been great names, but now was the time to add to them for exposure.   


I was unable to update everyone on my IRA as the post would not let me, so a small update and where I'm invested now.  
20% BRKB - 10% QQQ - 10% VTI - 10% VIG - 10% HYG - 20% GDX - 20% ICLN  


I do enjoy holding individual stocks, but a ROTH IRA is not the place to do so, I will do what I said above with my retail portfolio, after maxing out to 20,500/year, and diversifying my assets across many different sectors and ETF's I feel confident I can balance my retail account between individual stocks while still having a good amount of risk tolerance and sector balance. I know that individual stocks are risky and many may not agree with my decisions but I enjoy doing this, and if I am one of the 90% who makes under market returns than I will live with my decisions in life happy enough knowing I'm financially secure and doing alright. I will hopefully post an update in a year or so while I sit tight in a position I feel comfortable while selling covered calls every month to help hedge my risk tolerance further. My %'s may change as I figure out which stocks have the best returns with covered calls and what not but this is my current estimation.

&amp;#x200B;

Hiring in July was far better than expected, defying signs that the  economic recovery is losing steam, the Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported Friday.

Nonfarm payrolls rose 528,000 for the month and  the unemployment rate was 3.5%, easily topping the Dow Jones estimates  of 258,000 and 3.6% respectively.

Wage  growth also surged higher, as average earning earnings jumped 0.5% for  the month and 5.2% from the same time a year ago. Those numbers add fuel  to an inflation picture that already has consumer prices rising at  their fastest rate since the early 1980s. "|0.92|1226|0|1226
t3_wgto1o|1659700849|investing|I think video streaming might be ripe for some M&amp;A activity|"Bottom line, key forces in question:
- rates are low, deals would likely need to be mostly cash 
- this industry is saturated to begin with and I think was ripe for some consolidation to begin with. They have to invest more to compete for a smaller pie.
- people are going to look to cut costs amid inflation, and one of their 5 video streaming platforms is going to be a prime candidate. 

With inflation going up, people are looking for ways to save and one of the first places they’ll look is one of the numerous video streaming platforms they pay monthly for. And we’re already seeing this happen to some extent. 

The complicating factor here is that this inflation is precisely why rates are high, and rates being high is what makes M&amp;A activity low. 

As a result, I don’t think leverage will be a considerable part of these acquisitions. Specifically, I am suggesting that streaming companies with comparatively large cash balances will be the ones doing the acquiring. So that is one force influencing this. On the other side is the fact that if you’re a mid-tier streaming platform you’re popular enough to have appeal among viewers, but not so much to withstand cost cutting initiatives. And this market was already saturated to begin with, which makes investing in content to compete is that much more expensive. Meaning you may be inclined to merge or be acquired, and may be inclined to do so at a relative discount because you know your survival is in question. 

This is an idea I’ve had for about a week, and I just saw today that HBO is merging with Discovery (I understand that this was not a corporate merger, but it’s important because it illustrates the pressure to consolidate at the platform level, which will often require consolidation at the corporate level). So I think this may be the beginning of something. It’s just a matter of which stocks this means we should be buying."|0.6|5|0|5

https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/pdf/TDA101284.pdf

&gt; So for the cost of $2 in commissions, you can risk $4-$6k of your account to get control of $100k worth of S&amp;P.  So if the S&amp;P goes up 1% and becomes $101k — you just made $1k on your ~$5k margin investment — that’s a 20% return on capital!

I feel like this can be super dangerous for the average retail investor who wants big returns but has little cash (sub $20k). Is that why this product exists? Is it almost predatory to get people to risk $10k of their net worth and get themselves into way too deep/hot risky water?

I'm not here to debate how risky margin/leverage (let alone 1 SPX point being $50 per contract).

I just feel like... it's too good to be true? Not only that... you can't do wash sale trade tax writeoffs with equities but you can with futures, and they are taxed more advantageously than equities

&gt; In the United States, futures contracts are subject to the 60/40 rule. This advantageous tax treatment also applies to day trades and is broken down into two parts: 60% profits – taxed as long-term capital gains. 40% profits – taxed as short-term capital gains.

&gt; For options and futures contracts, the wash sale rule applies to losses from the trades or sales of options and contracts to sell or acquire stocks or securities.

1. Everywhere I read that the stock market is oversaturated with investors, it's easier than ever to enter it, and the trend of investing in the stock market (and investing in general) had risen dramatically over the past few years. I've read that because of the over-saturation, the entire market in itself is overvalued, and some analysts predict that the economy has overextended, and we're in for a downturn with no recovery in the forceable future (more on that in the second point). A good example is the ""tech bubble"" or the ""crypto rush"" that are very reminding of the dotcom bubble.
2. The current geopolitical events are very bearish, aside from the Ukraine war which brings a supply shortage in some commodities, the US-Chine situation and generally the climate situation, which we can see the consequences of in the present, and the recession, and seems as though things are not going to go well in the near future, I understand that in the grand scheme of things, these events bring short-term market downturn, but with the climate situation, it seems we'll get shorter and shorter of resources.

t3_wezeun|1659509460|investing|Intel hit 4% div yield, but can it keep paying it|"Recently released financials from Intel disappointed investors. The figures turned out to be much worse than expected and the share price flew down.  When the share price falls, the dividend yield naturally rises. But the question sharply arises - ""can the company continue to pay and increase its dividend payments"".

 I use 3 groups of indicators to determine the financial stability of a company:  Liquidity, Financial stability and  Profitability Ratios.

Liquidity:

Cash Ratio = Cash + Cash Equivalents ÷ Current Liabilities, must be &gt; 0,2

Quick Ratio = Cash + Cash Equivalents + Short-term Investments + Accounts Receivable ÷ Current Liabilities, must be &gt; 1,0

Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities, must be &gt; 2,0

**According to the latest reports, Intel is on the borderline of liquidity and starts running out of money (FCF TTM -1 522 also tells it):**

Cash Ratio = 0,16 **&lt; 0,2**

Quick Ratio = 0,99 **&lt; 1.0**

Current Ratio = 1,85 **&lt; 2,0**

&amp;#x200B;

Financial stability:

Equity Ratio = Total Equity ÷ Total Assets, must be &gt; 0,4

Debt Ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Assets, must be &lt; 0,6

Debt to Equity = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Equity, must be 0,4 - 1,0, but &lt; 1,5

Interest coverage ratio = EBIT ÷ Interest Expenses, must be &gt; 1,5

**Intel is financially stable and able to pay current dividend levels in the near future** 

Equity Ratio = 0.59 &gt; 0,4

Debt Ratio = 0,4 &lt; 0,6

Debt to Equity = 0,68 

Interest coverage ratio = 17,3

&amp;#x200B;

Profitability:

Gross Profit Margin % = Gross Profit ÷ Revenue

Operating Profit Margin % = Operating Profit ÷ Revenue

Net Profit Margin % = Net Income ÷ Revenue 

ROA (Return on Assets) = Net Income ÷ Total Assets

ROE (Return on Equity) = Net Income ÷ Average Shareholder’s Equity

Profitability ratios should be compared with other companies in the sector in order to determine the place among competitors, here the numbers for Intel - AMD - Nvidia (because you like to compare them):

Gross Profit Margin = 49,8% &gt; 48,5% &lt; 65,25%

Operating Profit Margin = 18,8% &lt; 20,8% &lt; 33,6%

Net Profit Margin = 26% &gt; 17,9% &lt; 32%

ROA = 11,2% &gt; 5% &lt; 31,9%

ROE = 19,4% &gt; 10,8% &lt; 35,7%

Nvidia beats all, but Intel looks also good.

I have a position at Intel since 2018 and do not plan to get rid of it yet. But the first bells for this decision are already there."|0.91|161|0|161

https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2022/0802

&gt;	**Inspecting Individual Recession Indicators**


&gt;The NBER committee’s indicators used to date business cycles include real (inflation-adjusted) personal income minus transfers, nonfarm payroll employment, employment as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics household survey, real personal consumption expenditures, wholesale-retail sales adjusted for price changes and industrial production.

&gt;The gray lines in Chart 1 show the movements of nonfarm payrolls and industrial production in each previous business cycle relative to the peak of that cycle (month 0 = 100); the average across all previous cycles is the black line. The 2020 COVID-19-induced recession is excluded because its cause, scale and timing were extremely atypical. The red line is the indicator’s movement between June 2021 and June 2022 relative to the level in December 2021.

&gt;	The data show that employment in the overall economy and output of the industrial sector in 2022 have significantly outperformed what occurred during every previous recession at a similar point. Chart 2 repeats this exercise for an alternate source of employment (surveying households rather than businesses) and for manufacturing and trade sales.

&gt;	While these indicators in 2022 (red line) are not as starkly above the gray recession lines as the indicators in Chart 1, their paths remained at the higher end of the distribution and were notably higher than the corresponding average recession paths. These indicators are also more volatile than their counterparts in Chart 1, with a wider range of recessionary outcomes.

&gt;Finally, Chart 3 shows a similar pattern as Chart 2 for real consumption and real personal income excluding transfers.


——-


&gt;	**Low Unemployment Rate Is Also Argument Against Recession**


&gt;While not listed among the indicators considered by the NBER committee, the unemployment rate is also among the indicators pointing to labor market strength through the first half of 2022 (Chart 5, Panel B). It has declined from 3.9 percent in December 2021 to 3.6 percent in March 2022, where it has held steady through June. By month six, every other recession incurred an unemployment rate increase of at least 0.3 percentage points.

&gt;Increases in unemployment may also better match conceptually what is generally understood to mean a recession—an increase in slack or underutilization of resources rather than a decline in economic activity. As trend GDP growth slows due to aging demographics and slower productivity gains, there may be more frequent periods of negative GDP growth without an increase in unemployment, making the distinction between increasing slack and declining activity more relevant than in the past.

I deposited 5000 CHF (Swiss Francs) into my TD Ameritrade account, and used the international wire transfer instructions they gave. They stated that the banks they work with don't charge any fees, but that our own bank might. 
For CHF to USD transfers, you’re supposed to wire the money to Citibank London, so I did that. 
I then noticed that in another document, they contradicted themselves and said the two banks they work with for wire transfers don’t charge any fees (Citibank was not one of those).

Based on the exchange rates around the time I deposited the money, I should have gotten at least $5150. Certainly never less than $5000. I ended up with about $4960 on my account. 

I reached out to my bank asking if they use an intermediary bank and they clearly stated that they had sent 5000 Swiss Francs to Citibank London, without converting them of subtracting any fees.

l asked Ameritrade if I could see any statement regarding potential fees from Citibank or the conversion rate, and they said they didn't have access to that, but
also made it VERY clear that I should not contact Citibank London directly.

Are hidden fees for wire transfers like this common? Is it safer to convert my own money and then deposit it directly? Do I have any right to demand the conversion rates and/or fees from Ameritrade or Citibank? I’m clearly new to this process and should have probably researched this better beforehand."|0.67|8|0|8

I have this question that I can't seem to wrap my head around. 

Currently, I have two investment accounts which I contribute to monthly (one account managed by a broker, one account I buy ETFs in myself). Since these are both heavily invested in similar ETFs and aimed at the long-term, I have been considering combining them into one account.  So, of course I want to obtain the greatest yields and I understand the importance of compound interest. Using some calculators I computed the speculated yield over a period of 10 years for both accounts. 

However, I was wondering if the generated compound interest would be greater if the assets of the accounts were combined. On the one hand my understanding of compound interest is that a larger starting capital will lead to a greater ""snowball surface"" able to collect more compound interest. On the other hand, I feel like two halves will generate the same combined interest when ultimately added up. I have not been able to find a satisfactory answer using compound interest calculators myself, so I hoped you guys could enlighten me!

t3_we9lk0|1659440926|investing|Discussion - How do you personally invest in clean energies?|"There are several reasons to invest in clean energies. Either moral reasons, because you want your investments to go towards a better future. Or financial reasons, because it is likely that clean energies will in the future represent a much bigger market share.

In particular, solar energy has been growing a lot over the past 10 years. See for example Nextera (NEP @ NYSE) with +100% in 5 years (on top of dividends) and many other examples (BEP, CWEN, ...).     

There are also some UFOs like ENPH @ NASDAQ, with +30'000% in 5 years, or DQ @ NYSE with +1000% in the same time period. Insane gains if you manage to board the train early. 

Even Big Oil says they are working on it - whether you believe them or not is another question. TotalEnergies (TTE @ NYSE) may be serious about it, and while their stock does not grow, a 5-6% dividend yield is nothing to laugh at.

As oil prices soar and natural gas is getting rarer due to the war, maybe even more people are willing to give clean energies a try. In that case the best opportunity was probably in February 2022, but it is not impossible that it keeps growing steadily in the future.

t3_wdg0an|1659356104|investing|Small Cap Value ETF paradox?|"This is probably an incredibly stupid thought/question but here goes:

If a fund or ETF is focused on Small Cap stocks this means it likely tracks an index such as Russell 2000 or S&amp;P Small Cap 600 for its benchmark. To satisfy the ""value"" part of it, an actively managed fund such as AVUV or passively managed fund such as SLYV will target companies that are attractively undervalued and priced as such. 

The expectation here (I assume) is that these companies will outperform over time and provide a return for investors. 

However, is there a paradox here? If a company lives up to its classification of being undervalued and ends up outperforming , i.e. share price rises to be more in line with its intrinsic value or even more so if the company scales or something, doesn't this change how the stock is classified (maybe becoming a mid cap growth etc) and thus will be rebalanced out of the funds holdings? 

My thought is that sure, if this happens, the fund will benefit from the realized gain and be able to re-invest that capital into other small caps, increasing AUM, and rinse repeat.

But isn't the Investor now missing out on the continued price appreciation of the stock in its new category? (Let's assume the investor doesn't hold other broad funds or ETFs)  Maybe it was undervalued at $10/share, but is fairly valued at $20/share but will really see its run from $20 to $80/share?

Maybe ""growth"" is the wrong term. Maybe they have already experienced their growth phase as microcaps and have settled into their stride as eternally small cap companies under $2bn.

Still my stupid question remains - In order to capture the full potential of a small cap value stock, doesn't the Investor need to keep track of when an ETF rebalances stocks out of its holdings and attempt to capture that value via a crossover ETF or by directly purchasing the individual stock?

I mean, I keep an eye on the holdings of the diversified ETFs I hold, but I never specifically thought about if I should attempt to capture the specific life of a stock as it moves through different caps and classifications.  That's why I hold ETFs - because I don't trust that I'd be able to pick individual winners consistently that will beat a risk adjusted index return.  

Doesn't this create a paradox though, where I AM attempting to pick stocks, increasing my risk, the opposite of what ETF investing is supposed to be accomplishing? 

What is the proper way to approach this? Apologies if conceptually this is all incorrect and I should just be focusing on the historical and expected returns of any given set of ETFs that fit my strategy.  Even so, I don't like the idea of missing a young Amazon that today is small and undervalued but next year trades at a high P/E and is no longer in the ETF where it started.

The following are three stocks that hedge funds believe have significant growth potential.

NVIDIA

is a hedge fund favorite, with many hedge funds raising their stake in the company recently. KG&amp;L Capital Management LLC increased its stake in NVIDIA by 15.7% in the first quarter. In Q4 2021, Ken Griffin’s Citadel fund increased its position in the company by more than 56%. Other hedge funds that have increased their stake in NVIDIA recently include CENTRAL TRUST Co, Welch Group LLC, and Shelton Wealth Management LLC.

PlantX Life Inc. (CSE: VEGA) (Frankfurt: WNT1) (OTCQB: PLTXF)

In a recent independent research report on PlantX, New York-based hedge fund Capital Y Management referred to PlantX as “a market leader with a revolutionary business in a growing industry with long-term tailwinds.” A 12-month price target of C$0.67 per common share has been set by Capital Y Management, which would equate to a C$68 million enterprise value for PlantX.

Capri Holdings Ltd. (CAPRI)

Capri Holdings stock has suffered a significant sell-off this year despite robust growth. The stock is down 27% this year but that has only attracted institutional investors to the company. Hedge funds such as Counterpoint Mutual Funds LLC and National Bank of Canada FI have increased their stake in the company this year. Despite macroeconomic challenges, the company delivered solid Q1 2022 results and issued above-consensus guidance.

t3_wciedp|1659250024|investing|100% of my Roth is in a single stock|"Update on 100% ROTH in 1 stock

I did not expect the amount of response on my original post, I think when originally creating the post and being new to the sub that it wouldn't garner much attention, in my lack of detail I think some missed key points of my original discussion.

AMD which was 100% of my portfolio in my ROTH, but only 10% of my overall investments, I thought that having it in my ROTH would be really beneficial as I can avoid taxes, however after reading hundreds of responses there are many more disadvantages to having a concentrated portfolio of any kind.
- Inability to claim losses to offset capital gains tax
- 6,000 contribution limit makes it very costly in any loss scenario as with a 10% average market appreciation 6k over many years, and diversified will always yield positive returns, where as an individual stock is gambling.

I was given the advice to move AMD to my retail account where I've held my full 102 share stake, but I've sold ETFs and now my ROTH IRA is 100% SPY until I have more time to find ETFs that diversify my portfolio with less expense rates as there are many funds I wasn't currently aware of.

Another tip given by a CFP (Certified Financial Planner) is that I max my 401k, but instead of using my pre-tax traditional 401k I just do both roth.
-Swapped Pre-Tax 401k traditional to Post Tax Roth 401k
- Changed my 401k contribution to the maximum allowed, while taking the most advantage of my employer match

I originally thought I was making the smart play by avoiding taxes, but in reality I was going to pay more taxes if I ended up losing money because I could no longer recoup my losses against my capital gains.

It was also brought to my attention that some thought a 25% concentration in Ethereum was a lot, which I do agree as it heavily correlates with tech, it isn't liquidable because it's staked so I have no way of moving this allocation around but I plan on lower it to 10% and adding to my brkb and taking a stake in some dividend etfs, once I do more research. I'll do a complete portfolio explanation once I have time to research and find a mix that I think suitably diversifes risk while giving exposure to more sectors.

Thanks for the advice everyone. I appreciate it, also I didn't wake up until 10am so I made a little extra profit in my ROTH before I sold :)

If anyone has any advice on ETFs to research or constructive criticism Im all ears, I know some critized me selling covered calls against my shares to reduce my risk, if anyone else has any ideas to hedge my risk in a more profitable way I'd love to learn.


Update: I'm going to sell a call for my target price a month out, if the guidance is bad I'll use the premium decay to recover some losses, if it's good then I'll either be called out or roll my call over to whatever I see as my new price target each month. Wish me luck :)

I'm 23 years old and make around 80,000-100,000$ a year, just recently started putting money into a  Roth IRA last year, right now I have 9600\~ in AMD stock and I really like the stock. I've traded a few stocks here and there but AMD is my top stock to own right now, I put 7% of my paycheck into my 401k from work, and save around 90% of my money in long term investments. I only have the Roth IRA to really invest in my own opinions, the others are all just ETF's in my other accounts.   
What do you guys think about having 100% of a Roth IRA in a single stock?   
I like to trade in Roth IRA because of tax advantages and ability to withdraw deposits.    
Please don't clown on me, I just am genuinely curious as to how others, older than me balance their  IRA's and if anyone had bad/good experiences in their life with it.

Teacher switching careers and leaving the education field for a myriad of reasons - loved the job, hating the profession. I finished my 10th year but unfortunately 4 of those years were at a private parochial school so I unfortunately won't qualify for a pension distribution upon retirement age. I'll be getting the money (about $20,000) out of there as soon as my final summer paychecks stop coming through.

Current plan: I wanted to convert the capital into a Roth IRA and spread the funds (about $20,000) into various REITs with monthly distributions for faster DRIP compounding for the next 30 years - or really until I die. 

My hope is of course to create a steady dividend income stream upon retirement so that when I pass, the core of the nest egg will still be there for my children. I will also have a Roth IRA set up with my new employer and they have a company match on any contributions I make - which is why I wanted to start this non-employer Roth IRA and just leave it rather than get conservative with it closer to retirement age and reinvest it all into more stable things like bonds or whatever. 

No this isn't a recommendation for tickers or anything like that - just seeking thoughts on this situation and general plan for the funds. And I probably won't actually execute this until the housing market shows the effects of the current state of inflation &amp; recession buzz and hopefully capitalize on a good price entry opportunity on some kind of major correction or (unfortunate) housing collapse.

* Supply-side inflation: there is a dearth of resources/goods/services, and people are willing to pay a higher price for every bit they can get. Rising prices does not stop people from buying and bidding higher, which creates an inflation spiralling out of control. Raising interest rates in such an environment would do little, will it not? Currently, it's the risk of extended war and resurgence in demand after COVID that can contribute to an inflation surge powered by an inability of the global supply chain to meet these demands.

* Demand-side inflation: people have more to spend, because money was available so cheaply. There is lot more debt than can be financed, and once the Feds/central banks raise rates, after some defaults, things go back to ""normal"". Demand adjusts to a level that normalises the prices and inflation kind of just dissipates. People are not buying stuff out of desperation, they just wanted to raise their standard of living.

What kind of inflation are we in? Investing in Supply-side inflation seems kind of profitable for some companies (they can increase prices without damaging revenue) but overall it seems a terrible situation. Demand-side inflation seems more healthy and generally good time to, ""buy the dips"".

Inflation is always presented as this ""invisible evil force"" that is bad and ever-present danger, but inflation is driven by us, the humans. Why do people keep buying at higher and higher prices?

Our employer matches paycheck contributions at 100% for up to 4%, plus 50% match for 4-6% contributions.

t3_w9slrk|1658962275|investing|The 8 economists who decide if the U.S. is in a recession|" (The Washington Post) -- The 8 economists who decide if the U.S. is in a recession

Democrats  and Republicans have begun arguing over whether the U.S. economy is in a  recession ahead of a key data release on Thursday. But the official  pronouncement will ultimately come down to a little-known group of  economists selected by the National Bureau of Economic Research called  the “Business Cycle Dating Committee,” which stubbornly takes its time  and tries to wall itself off from political interference or attempts to  spin its findings.

The  stakes for the group are high, in part because of the extraordinarily unusual economic conditions two years after the last recession, early in the coronavirus pandemic. The economy contracted in the first quarter  of the year, and many Republicans say a recession is here already, with  Thursday’s release expected by many analysts to show a second  consecutive quarter of negative growth. But from President Biden down,  administration officials are instead pointing to other indicators  showing the economy remains strong and insisting the committee would be wrong to declare a recession.

The  political haggling is not supposed to matter to the eight economists  who rule on when recessions start. Their decision is almost certainly  months away, if it comes at all: The committee typically waits long  after a recession has begun to declare it, only acting when the evidence  has become overwhelming, sometimes even after the recession is already  over. That puts the pressure bearing down on the organization from the  outside — to promptly render a verdict on one of the most important  matters facing economic policymakers — directly at odds with its mission  to provide unassailable empirical decisions.

As  a result, what seems like a straightforward question — is the U.S.  economy in a recession? — is in part decided on a subjective basis at a  later date, sometimes when it no longer appears pertinent, by experts in  closed-door meetings of a privately selected committee.

“By  far, the most important thing to try to convey is that the committee is  not trying to do real-time dating of whether we’re in a recession,”  said MIT economics professor James Poterba, the NBER president and a  member of the committee, in an interview. “There’s often enormous amount  of interest in that question and what many people are hoping for, but  the committee’s task is to create a consistent historical record of the  turning points — the peaks and the troughs in the U.S. economy.”

The  group’s calculus could become increasingly fraught in the following  months, amid puzzling economic conditions that defy easy  characterization. The political consequences for the committee could be  significant, as the Biden administration faces growing public anger over  high inflation and its economic stewardship. Congressional Republicans  will also be eager to seize on a ruling that the economy is in a  recession, trying to capitalize on voter discontent ahead of this fall’s  midterm elections.

Asked  about the upcoming economic numbers, Biden on Monday disputed the  notion that a recession was imminent. That is part of a broader  administration campaign in recent weeks to rebut GOP claims that a  recession has already begun. Top economic officials, including Treasury  Secretary Janet L. Yellen and White House National Economic Council  Director Brian Deese, appeared on cable TV news Sunday and Monday to  reiterate their view that the U.S. economy is not technically in  recession — and wouldn’t be even if the GDP numbers show a second  consecutive quarter of contraction.

This  strategy has its risks, though, because if the United States does enter  a recession later, their current assurances will look misguided —  particularly after the administration already incorrectly dismissed the  threat of inflation last year.

“We’re  not going to be in a recession, in my view. The \[unemployment\] rate is  still one of the lowest we’ve had in history,” Biden said on Monday. “My  hope is we go from this rapid growth to steady growth.”

At  the core of the challenge facing the committee of economists is that it  relies on more than a half-dozen criteria to measure when a recession  has begun. The general impression many Americans — and some commentators  — have is that a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of  negative economic growth. But that is not how the NBER, or most  economists, think of it. Instead, the committee weighs factors such as  payroll levels, retail sales, industrial production and personal income  when making a comprehensive assessment about whether the economy is in  recession. The committee stresses on its website that “there is no fixed  rule about what measures contribute information to the process or how  they are weighted in our decisions.”

As  Deese told CNN: “In terms of the technical definition, it’s not a  recession — the technical definition considers a much broader spectrum  of data points.”

Traditionally,  all these various economic metrics move in tandem, making the  committee’s job easier. Usually, when growth declines, so do employment,  consumer activity and the other measures of economic health. But the  economy since the start of the pandemic has confounded prior models and  may do so again. Economic growth may end up declining for two  consecutive quarters — although the first quarter in the United States  was negative due largely to technical factors, such as a temporary  uptick in overall imports — even as unemployment remains among the  lowest levels in American history. Consumer spending has remained  strong, too, in a way at odds with a typical recession. If unemployment  remains low even as growth contracts, the NBER economists could face a  vexing challenge in deciding how to categorize the situation.

Predicting  the committee’s decision is made more difficult by the way in which it  operates. As part of the NBER, the Business Cycle Dating Committee is  run by a private nonprofit group — not the federal government or a state  statistical agency. Its membership is selected by the president of the  NBER “in consultation” with the committee chair, according to Poterba.

The  committee’s meetings are not publicized. They’re held in a closed-door  conference room on the third floor of the Cambridge, Mass., office  building where NBER is headquartered. They don’t meet on a fixed  schedule: Board Chairman and Stanford economist Bob Hall is responsible  for calling the meetings. During long periods of consistent economic  growth, the board can go years without having anything to discuss, and  therefore, it might hold no meetings. It wouldn’t even confirm when past  meetings have happened.

“The committee does not announce its meeting schedule, and that’s something we don’t talk about,” Poterba said.

Its last public pronouncement came on July 19, 2021 — when [the committee declared](https://www.nber.org/news/business-cycle-dating-committee-announcement-july-19-2021) that there had been a recession between February and April 2020, the shortest one in U.S. history.

The  eight economists on the committee are among the most respected in their  field. Some have served in Democratic administrations, but past members  have also included GOP appointees. In addition to Poterba and Hall, the  members are Christina Romer and David Romer of the University of  California at Berkeley; James Stock, of Harvard; Robert Gordon, of  Northwestern; Valerie Ramey, of the University of California at San  Diego; and Mark Watson, of Princeton.

The  NBER has its roots in the period following World War I, after a  Columbia-trained economist who worked for labor and trade organizations  and the chief statistician at AT&amp;T formed a new organization after  realizing they had little shared empirical data with which to conduct  policy debates. In the early 1960s, the Commerce Department began  publishing a digest on business conditions that cited the NBER’s work on  the ups and downs of the business cycle, giving it a kind of federal  imprimatur, according to Poterba.

Poterba  stressed that the board is aware of public hunger for guidance about a  recession but does not let it dictate their decisions. Economic data is  often later revised, and the committee is careful not to announce a  verdict that is contingent on data that could later be changed.

“The  NBER is really trying to provide guideposts for researchers; it’s not  trying to provide short-term political talking points for either party,”  said Steve Miran, who served as a senior official in the Treasury  Department under Donald Trump’s administration and is the co-founder of  Amberwave Partners, an investment fund. “We’d all like it to be binary —  0 to 1, recession or not — but the truth is it’s much more of  continuum. It requires interpretation of the length, depth and speed of  the contraction, as well as which sectors of the economy are contracting  and why. … And that requires an element of judgment.”

Still,  that does not mean the board’s members are always in agreement. Harvard  economist Jeffrey Frankel, who served as a member of the committee for  roughly 25 years, said there is usually unanimity about the broad  questions of whether a recession is beginning or ending, but differences  can emerge about precisely what month a recession began or ended.

“There  are times when the right answer is not clear, and the kind of thing  there may be disagreement about is someone wanting more data — like  revisions to the \[gross domestic product\], for instance — and someone  else saying, ‘It’s already been 11 months, and if we wait longer people  will think the news will be too stale,’ ” Frankel said. “That tension is  always an issue.”

This is one of the highest prices ever paid by the nation.|"Prices of coal have been skyrocketing as the world shuns Russia. Nippon Steel just reached an agreement with Glencore to purchase power plant coal at $375/ton through March of 2023. It's a relatively short-term contract, totaling just 8 months, but shows that at least in the near-term, prices for power plant coal will most likely remain elevated. Here's an excerpt from Bloomberg describing the historic event,

""[Glencore Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GLEN:LN),  the mining and commodity trading giant, agreed to supply coal to a  Japanese customer at one of the highest prices ever paid by the nation,  threatening to further accelerate inflation.

[Nippon Steel Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/5401:JP)  agreed on an annual supply deal through March with Glencore for power plant coal at $375 per ton, according to people with knowledge of the  deal, who asked not to be identified because the information is private.  The agreement is three times more expensive than [similar deals](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QUCZVTDWRGG3) done last year, and is likely one of the costliest coal contracts ever signed by a Japanese company, one of the people said."" -[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/glencore-strikes-one-of-japan-s-most-expensive-ever-coal-deals](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/glencore-strikes-one-of-japan-s-most-expensive-ever-coal-deals)

The Glencore deal may be used as a benchmark price for other thermal coal contracts across Asia increasing electricity-generation costs for households and industrial consumers. 

Also, when a first world importer commits itself to paying high-prices for a period of time, it can further impact inflation and have disastrous effects for the developing world, since third world countries won't be able to pay these prices. Prices can become increasingly entrenched when they are contractually obligated to persist.

Coal was previously seen as a means of producing low-cost electricity for developing nations. The Phillipines generates nearly 50% of it's electricity from coal powered sources and imports nearly 70% of it's coal consumption. Thailand generates nearly 20% of it's total electricity from coal-powered sources and imports 56% of it's consumption. Pakistan generates over 15% of it's electricity from coal-powered sources and imports \~70% of it's consumption. 

It's fair to assume that as prices increase for electricity generation, basic access to energy will decline as third-world countries will have difficulty maintaining grids. Energy security and political stability are positively correlated."|0.82|17|0|17

&gt; Americans age 70 and above had a net worth of nearly $35 trillion, according to Federal Reserve data. That amounts to 27% of all U.S. wealth, up from 20% three decades ago. Their wealth is equal to 157% of U.S. gross domestic product, more than double the proportion 30 years ago, federal data show.

As this cohort dies, millennials and Gen Xers are set to get the largest wealth transfer in history. COVID jumpstarted it.

AMSTERDAM/LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - Not convinced by central banks' pledge to stamp on inflation, many investors are on the hunt for assets that will protect their portfolios from years of decline in the value of money. These funds are buying up inflation-linked bonds and real estate, while also taking long-term bets on the outperformance of stocks, including those in industries like timber and farmland.

The idea is to have your money ""working double time"" by compounding the value of your Life Insurance policy while funding real estate investments by borrowing against your cash value. The mechanics of it are pretty simple and make sense to me, but I've read that this isn't advisable due to a few reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Fees on the front-end of the life of the policy can be high and won't contribute to your cash value, giving you a low cash value to borrow against in the beginning
2. Most people end up surrendering their policies for a variety of reasons, including affordability

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding reason #1, part of the strategy of using a Cash Value Life Insurance Policy is to overfund your policy to maximize cash value that you may borrow against to fund real estate investments. On the surface, this seems like a reasonable idea to alleviate reason #1, but I don't know enough about the consequences/downsides of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody have knowledge/experience regarding using Cash Value Life Insurance Policies as a tool in the context of real estate investing? Would love all feedback.

Here’s how the company did:

Earnings: $2.23 per share, adjusted, vs. $2.29 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue: $51.87 billion, vs. $52.44 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

During the quarter, Microsoft reduced its quarterly guidance for income and revenue because of changing foreign-exchange rates. CEO Satya Nadella said employees will get pay increases, and the company introduced services to help customers deal with security incidents.

When management lowered earnings expectations, though, it didn’t factor in other issues that could hurt results.

Technology industry researcher Gartner said earlier this month that logistical disruptions in the quarter had dragged down PC shipments, a key input for sales of Windows operating system licenses to device makers. Plus, macroeconomic worries that hurt revenue growth for advertising-driven social-media companies Snap and Twitter could rub off on Microsoft. In 2021 the company generated $10 billion in advertising revenue before traffic-acquisition costs.

Microsoft shares have sold off 25% so far this year, compared with a decline of 17% for the S&amp;P 500 U.S. stock index.

I've called several times and each time I've tried I got a message that the estimated wait time exceeded their business hours and then the call was dropped. Finally I found the time to make the call early enough to be put into the queue. The recording said I had a ""2 or more"" hour wait but shrugged that off and strapped myself in Clockwork Orange style and took the beating of their over emphasized prerecording. After 92 minutes I got someone. Things were looking up I suppose.

Unfortunately that was about as far as my luck was taking me. I was told the refund process was being done manually and that they were processing through 10's of thousands of refunds and that the process had to involve a number of checks to make sure everything was being done properly and that it was being done on a first-come order. I asked if there was any estimate on when my refund would be processed, or if I could be given an idea on what date they were currently working through, but no luck. I asked if I could get a case number so that I could check in at a later time via email instead of waiting in the queue and again no luck. I asked finally if there was anything I could do either now or in the future to move this along, and again the answer was no. I did get the reassurance that the refund would eventually be processed and that if I wanted to assign it to a giftbox that I could do that. That is about the only escape from this that I could find, but unfortunately I've already allocated my giftbox for everyone for future years at this point. Instead of purchasing additional I-bonds while I waited for the refund, I should have tried contacting them sooner and not trusted their schedule.

TL;DR refunds are processed manually and you have no way of finding out when your refund will arrive. You can try calling 844-284-2676 and ask them to move your I-bonds into the giftbox for you instead of receiving the refund (all rules still apply), but expect a very long wait time and make sure to get into the queue early."|0.62|9|0|9

CEO Tobi Lütke says company made wrong bet on pandemic-fueled boom in e-commerce growth lasting


[Source: CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6532165)

Ottawa-based e-commerce company Shopify Inc. is laying off roughly 1,000 people as explosive growth in the company's online selling business model slows.

""For a company like ours this news will be difficult to digest,"" founder and CEO Tobi Lütke said in an email to staff that was later published on the company's website.

According to regulatory filings, the company had about 10,000 employees at the end of 2021, twice the amount they had before the pandemic. The cuts amount to 10 per cent of the company's entire work force.

Affected staff are being notified on Tuesday. Most of the lay-offs will be in recruiting, support and sales, the company says.  Anyone affected will get 16 weeks of severance pay, plus an extra week for every year they've been with the company. And the company will remove limitations on any stock options they may be entitled to.

Like many digital-focused companies, Shopify saw demand for its services explode during the pandemic, as lockdowns forced consumers and businesses to adapt quickly to buying and selling online.

In response to this increased demand, Shopify expanded aggressively, hiring staff to keep up with the mass of new customers for its core service of helping real-world retailers sell goods online.

The boom was so massive that at one point in mid-2020, Shopify became the most valuable company in Canada, topping the Royal Bank of Canada, with a valuation of almost $300 billion.

While the uptick in sales and revenue was very real, maintaining that momentum proved difficult, as the company's growth showed signs of slowdown toward the end of 2021. Today, the company is worth about $50 billion. Shares in the company fell about 15 per cent when the TSX opened on Tuesday.

Shopify isn't the only tech company to feel the pinch of a slowdown. U.S. giants like Netflix, Google, Apple, Microsoft and Paypal all saw their prospects dim as the spectre of inflation took a bite out of consumer spending.

In his letter to staff, Lütke says demand for online shopping is growing, but no longer at the frenzied pace seen in 2020. All in all, e-commerce is about where it would have been had the pandemic surge not happened, he said.

Shopify had boosted its staffing levels on the assumption that explosive growth would continue.

""We bet that the .. share of dollars that travel through e-commerce rather than physical retail would permanently leap ahead,"" Lütke said. ""It's now clear that bet didn't pay off.""

The company is slated to reveal its quarterly results on Wednesday morning, and financial analysts who cover the company have been scrambling to downgrade their expectations."|0.96|669|0|669

1. KULR announced securing a battery safety contract with NASA to test its lithium-ion cells for future battery packs designed for the Artemis Program, a series of US-led international human spaceflight programs. In that deal, KULR will be processing up to **10,000 lithium-ion cells per week and preparing for tests performed by NASA**, the Department of Defense, and others completing crewed flighted missions.  

2. KULR added an additional and potentially substantial revenue-generating shot on goal to its mix after releasing a passive propagation resistant (""PPR"") solution in its KULR-Tech Safe Case product family for maritime lithium-ion battery safety. This can be a big deal, noting that it's the only known PPR solution meeting the upcoming United States Coast Guard's new safety requirements for the passenger vessel industry.  

3. KULR has signed multi-million dollar contracts and is advancing development deals with industry behemoths, including NASA, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT, $LMT), Johnson Controls, Leidos (NYSE: LDOS), and the Andretti United E Team racing group. Few, if any, other micro-cap names can come close to boasting a similar list  

4. KULR's recent acquisition of Centropy AB's innovative technologies also adds considerable value, both intrinsically and inherently. The thermal management technologies acquired through this deal can be seamlessly integrated into their existing portfolio of technologies and services for meeting demand in industries like **artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cryptocurrency mining** – each presenting significant new market opportunities.  

5. KULR has partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) to assist in their lithium-ion battery lifecycle initiative alongside Clarios. This initiative seeks to improve **lithium-ion battery production, recycling, and disposal practices**. With involvement in initiatives like this coming straight from the DoE, KULR is cementing itself as the go-to company for industry-specific battery safety and disposal services. And with billions of lithium-ion batteries being used, that position is enviable. [https://chartingdaily.com/revolutionary--battery-tech](https://chartingdaily.com/revolutionary--battery-tech)

The devaluation of the euro obviously has negative impacts on us Europeans, especially in international purchases that are made in dollars (e.g. energy), but it has also positive impacts on the export of our companies, which are able to be price-competitive due to a weaker euro and probably to present better results in euro currency balance sheets.

Therefore, I thought it might be a good idea for us Europeans to try to analyze medium-sized or large companies that could take advantage of the benefits associated with the euro devaluation.

Generally speaking, I set myself the goal of looking for and analyzing companies:

\- that export excellent products that would continue to be sold in the U.S. even in the case of the arrival of what seems to be the coming recession.

\- that by taking advantage of currency devaluation would be able to increase their market share in the U.S. without having to reduce their margins in the Euro.

\- who have most of their production in Europe but sell largely in the U.S. or otherwise using the dollar as their currency.

\- whose supply of raw materials is done in local currency but who sell primarily in dollars

These are just a few ideas of what might be the characteristics to look for. Obviously, just because a company has these attributes does not mean that it might actually be a good investment, however I feel it might be worth trying to make a list of companies that meet these requirements.

Do you know of any European listed companies that might actually benefit from the devaluation of the euro against the dollar?"|0.67|3|0|3

I would be willing and able to dedicate six to eight hours per day studying and practicing day trading, in hopes of eventually becoming profitable. The goal would be to make enough year after year to live comfortably on my own and afford any expenses. 

I know the odds of being profitable long term from day trading are low, but I'm pretty sure the odds are a lot better then a purely creative pursuit like being an author, which would be my dream occupation. Same when you compare it to something like being an actor or singer. The chances of those are likely less then one percent whereas it seems the chances of being a successful day trader are more like five to ten percent if you're willing to fully dedicate yourself to it. If I can prove that I'm profitable long term I have access to at least $100,000 to trade with and as far as I'm aware there aren't any account minimums in Canada.  

Writing is something I could do for a few hours every evening and probably still make a go at it, but from the research I've done day trading works a lot better if you're fully committed. If I don't go the trading route then my plan is to go back to school for something IT related as I enjoy tech and problem solving. I would still much rather be a day trader though as I can set my own hours, not have a boss, and learn at my own pace. With everything said how viable is a career as a day trader and is it something I should try and pursue?   

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR - I have the ability to dedicate myself fulltime to learning day trading I'm wondering if it's a viable career.

A more than 5000% higher price was required to get Belgium to jack up deteriorating power plants to send electricity across the English Channel. 

Here's an excerpt from a piece by Javier Blas describing the issue in more detail. 

""On most days, the bottlenecks mean distorted costs. Sometimes, it  results in sky-high prices where energy is in short supply when it is  needed. At other occasions, prices can tumble to zero, or go negative,  when producers cannot sell their power into a congested transmission  system. Increasingly, it puts the whole system at risk. Talk to most  industry executives and you quickly get the sense that we  are sleepwalking into more blackouts. Discuss the problems with the  engineers who manage the system day-in, day-out, and that danger appears  even closer.    


The £9,724.54 price, settled between noon and  1:00 p.m. on July 20 via the so-called NEMO interconnector that links  the UK with Belgium, was the highest Britain has ever paid to import  electricity, nearly five times higher than the previous record. The  absurdity of that level is apparent when comparing it with the  year-to-date average for UK spot electricity: £178 per megawatt hour."" -[https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-07-25/london-s-record-9-724-54-per-megawatt-hour-to-avoid-a-blackout?srnd=premium-uk](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-07-25/london-s-record-9-724-54-per-megawatt-hour-to-avoid-a-blackout?srnd=premium-uk)

There wasn't a huge amount of energy purchased. Only enough to power 8 houses for a year. But the purchase adds some clarity to the desperate situation unfolding in Europe. The electricity demand for households goes up during the Winter as people run heaters, light their homes during shorter days, and tend to stay inside more often. The heat wave in Europe is unprecedented. July 19th, 2022 was Europe's hottest day in history at 40.3C (104.5F,) so these are far from normal circumstances. But with Nord Stream 1 operating at 20% of it's capacity, and the recent news of further turbine hold-ups, the European gas outlook is dictated by someone who doesn't like them. Germany may need to start rationing gas to be able to build up storage for the Winter.

QYLD says it sells covered calls and selling covered calls, afaiu, should mean that if the stock goes down, your calls expire and you just earn money from the sale -- here presumably generating the yield.

First a bit of background: This work was done solely by me over this weekend. I'm not a professional, nor have I attempted anything similar in the past. In fact, I wasn't aware of R squared before this weekend - so take everything with a major heap of sale. If there's mistakes and such, please feel free to point them out. It's also possible that everything I did was wrong and this is just gibberish. The point of this was to create an exercise for myself as well as create discussion online regarding attractive market options. There could also be a lot of simple mistakes there, but due to time constrains (weekend is finishing) I'm forced to post it online now. If you guys like it and if this even makes sense, I might do something similar in the future again

Also, I will happily share the Excel with the raw data and analysis. However, I do not know how to. I do not want to share from my personal office online account as I want to keep my reddit profile at least semi-private. If someone can please help me out, I would very much appreciate it. I'm sure my data and analysis needs a lot more work and we can make a editable version where multiple people can contribute

Data: Was compiled using freely available MSCI data found online. Historical PE by country MSCI Index was sourced from [Barclays](https://indices.barclays/IM/21/en/indices/static/historic-cape.app)

(data available for download). Then I found corresponding index historical data (took me a lot of time to find I might add) through [MSCI End of Day Index Data Search](https://www.msci.com/end-of-day-data-search). The website is very slow, but it works. For most of the developed markets, the data goes back to 1982, which I thought was sufficient enough to come to reasonable conclusions

Methodology: Using the data obtained above, I calculated 10 year annualized average return for each month (for example Jan 1982 to Jan 1992, Feb 1982 to Feb 1982) for each of the 12 MSCI Indexes: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Netherlands, Singapore, UK and USA. Then I used graph on Excel to make the line of best fit through regression analysis for each one of those markets. Because I was using 10 year returns, I could only use the 10 year annualized returns until June 2012 and run Regression analysis on CAPE vs returns until 2012 only as well. For developing countries, like Brazil and India the data set was much more limited, therefore I was forced to use 5 year returns. I also calculated the average 10 year return as well as the standard deviation for the 10 year returns. Then I ran a regression analysis on each of the data sets.

Results:

&amp;#x200B;

|Country|Current CAPE|Avrg Historical Cape|Average 10 YR Return|StDev of 10YR Return|Expected Future 10 Year Return|Line of Best Fit|R2 Squared|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|Germany|16.67|22.87|6.43%|4.86%|8.59%|y = -0.0031x + 0.1376|0.37|
|Hong Kong|16.62|20.15|8.29%|7.02%|10.32%|y = -0.0051x + 0.188|0.13|
|India|28.19|11.54|7.68%|12.22%|4.27%|y = -0.0054x + 0.1949|0.26|
|Japan|20.24|42.29|2.31%|6.40%|6.69%|y = -0.0016x + 0.0993|0.23|
|Netherlands|28|19.86|7.53%|5.97%|1.32%|y = -0.0058x + 0.1782|0.56|
|Singapore|13.12|22.20|4.94%|5.20%|8.37%|y = -0.0031x + 0.1244|0.13|
|UK|16.67|17.54|4.68%|5.24%|5.57%|y = -0.006x + 0.1557|0.25|
|USA|28.51|24.31|8.29%|5.04%|5.46%|y = -0.0052x + 0.2029|0.76|

 

Note: India and Brazil were calculated on a basis of 5 year annualized return due to the lack of data. Unlike other indexes that start in 1982, Brazil index data starts in May 2011 (earliest CAPE available) and India in August 2003.

Analysis: The data was surprising to say the least. My inspiration came from the book ""A random walk down wallstreet"" where the author Markiel mentions that CAPE Ratio, and that it is the best predictor of future returns. In the book, I believe he mentions that about 45% of the returns in the US stock market can be explained by CAPE Ratio. If my understanding is correct, he must be referencing the R squared. I do not remember which data set he used, but I wasn't able to get similar results.

Australia: Seems right around historical averages. Nothing too noteworthy, expect maybe a strong correlation (R2)

Brazil: It is the only country with expected negative returns. Brazil data sat was also the most limited, therefore it is hard to make any significant conclusions based on available data. Brazil also has the highest standard deviation. It seems that the Brazilian market has been insanely volatile in the 21st century. I did not run a Regression Analysis because I thought it was moot

Canada: Now this tripped me up big time. In fact, the only reason why I included line of best fit formula was for Canada. Canada has **POSITIVE** relationship on Cape vs Expected returns. The higher the CAPE, the higher is the 10 year expected return. I double checked the numbers. Unless I'm making a mistake somewhere that I'm not aware of, Canada is a fluke.

Europe: Nothing noteworthy with Europe MSCI Index,

Germany: Probably the best/safest investment out of all based on this analysis. German MSCI index seems to be below historical averages, has a pretty strong R2 and is posed for solid growth in the next decade from now

Hong Kong: For those wanting to take a risk, this might be a very good opportunity. I'm not at all surprised by this data, and it makes sense on an intuitive level as well. In the 2000s USA went through strong economic growth, but the stock market languished. After 2009 it went on an incredible bull run ending only now. China has spent the 2010s positioning itself from factory of the world to a world-wide brand. Tencent and other companies are now a household name. I took a short glance at the Hang Sek 50 index, and a lot of the top stocks are also Value companies. After tencent, there's a list of 4-5 banks. I checked their revenues and profits online and they have all grown massively in the last decade. Meanwhile the stock market has not moved. Of course banks are generally low P/E but it seems like the Chinese companies are highly undervalued even accounting for that. That being said, any investor should be careful to due high interference of the CCP. As for myself, I would consider buying a small leveraged position, something like Yinn 3x leveraged China ETF. However I will need to research more

India: India went through a massive bull run in the 2010s, along with USA. It is only the cyclical nature of the markets that the best performers of the previous decade tend to be lackluster in the next one. I'm not very bullish on India, especially with the sky high valuations

Japan: Japan is just a mess. Their CAPE systematically reached 50s 60s 70s and even peaked at 80s in the 2000s, they were overvalued for a long time even after the asset bubble burst. They seem like they're undervalued now, but honestly I don't think I know enough to say anything meaningful about Japan. If I were to speak out of my ass, I would say they were insanely overvalued from the 1980s all the way to 2010s so CAPE at 20 is not undervalued, but valuations catching up with reality. I would personally steer clear.

Netherlands: Interesting to see that Netherlands is overvalued next to its European peers. I do not know the reason for it. Needs more researching

Singapore: Another very good bet for the future IMO. Yes, R2 is low, but it is a developed economy and they have traditionally been very business savvy. I would definitely look more into investing into Singaporean Markets

UK: Have to say, quite surprised by this one. FTSE 100 hasn't returned much at all since the year 2000. I thought it would mean they're undervalued. but doesn't seem so. Interesting to note that while FTSE 100 (big-cap) stagnated, FTSE 250 (mid-cap) brought in stellar results, tripling since 2000. Definitely warrants further investing. I've also seen some evidence online that only FTSE 100 specifically is undervalued, so maybe a big cap play in the UK?

USA: Well, I think the amazing bull run is dead. For stellar growth in the coming years, we will have to go down much lower in the near future. Some people say it will happen, others think we're close to the bottom. If it's the latter, I personally wouldn't expect the returns of the last decade and a half going forward. In 2008/9 MSCI CAPE bottomed at 13. We're more than double that now. American markets can't grow exponentially to the corporate profit growth rate anymore without detaching from reality, so something has to give. Either we see a crash and another bull cycle, or a slow upwards growth.

Interestingly enough, USA has the highest R2. I wonder if it's due to highest pricing efficiency due to the largest investor participation.

Criticisms:

The obvious criticism of Shiller CAPE is Excess Cape. We are in an era of record low interest rates even with the recent hikes. A lot of people will rightfully point out that comparing current values to historical values is at least not painting the full picture i.e. more expensive stocks now make more sense than they did in the 90s. However Shiller CAPE is still one of the most powerful tools at our disposal for predicting future growth

The other criticism is the limitation of data. I couldn't get any meaningful information about emerging markets. Even for the developed markets, looking 1982-2012 might be too limited."|0.91|187|0|187

The formulation Ive heard a lot and which I've come to endorse:

ESG seeks to mitigate harm by creating exclusionary criteria or by seeking to account for negative externalities.

Impact investing, by contrast, seeks to actively achieve positive external outcomes - alongside the traditional objective of ensuring an adequate financial return.

Both endeavors could benefit enormously from objective methodologies and a move away from disparate self reporting frameworks. Both are commonly critiqued for making it too easy to use self reporting to obfuscate true performance (see: greenwashing and impact washing respectively)."|0.78|92|0|92
t3_w6ri69|1658654136|investing|Misconceptions about inflation.|"I see a lot of naive statements about the effects of inflation, mostly statements that it makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. This isn't necessarily the case.

During periods of high inflation, the purchasing power of a given amount of money falls. Ergo, those who own cash lose money while those who hold real assets are normally unaffected. Noteworthy is people are still buying bonds whose expected returns is lower than inflation, because holding these bonds is still better than holding cash. This extends to all paper assets, so if you hold stocks like a hedge fund you may still have a net loss even if you make money this year, but a landlord will likely be less affected as he still collects the rent even if he must raise prices and/or put expansions on hold. Farmers and dealers of staple necessities like water and medicine will be totally unaffected as the population needs a fixed amount of the stuff and will pay any price needed.

Also recall that many people, like me, have a negative net worth due to a lot of long term debt. These people are beneficiaries of inflation as the value of their debts outstanding falls, so don't let the economy deter you from going to college and such. On the reverse side, the people who issued all this long term debt (mostly banks of all shapes and sizes) will be incurring a loss as inflation exceeds the expected return of the loans. Retirees with large nest eggs saved up will be incurring losses as the value of their fortunes fall.

And yes, the Feds are deleting all that money they printed. They are doing so with bond trading. During Covid they printed money cheaply by simply placing orders for corporate bonds on the internet using money they simply credited their accounts. Now some of those bonds are maturing and the money paid back to the Feds, and they have raised the Federal Funds Rates (the interest rates they both lend and borrow at). This had the immediate effect of increasing the amount of people lending the Feds money and decreasing the amount of people borrowing from the Feds. All this extra money is simply deleted, and since it all happens electronically operational costs for this is pretty low."|0.42|0|0|0

The majority of things I hear or read are typically negative in sentiment when it comes to a company buying back its own stock. I hear it’s just propping it price up, or in a sense manipulating the market to think it’s a stronger investment than maybe it really is.  Or a combination of they are propping up the price in order to create buy pressure to dump their newly pumped price onto m new investors.

I have a few focused questions and then I will give my opinion on them for everyone to tell me how ignorant I am lol. I honestly would just like some clarity or even a link to something that is fairly non biased fact based regarding the subject.

1. Why do companies buy back stock?

2. Do these companies dump this stock they buy?

3. Does future possible movement by the FED come into play as far price or even their exposure to their holding %?

4. Do companies prey on workers with options as a cheap way to increase their holding % at a discounted rate normally?

*Are buy backs positive or negative? This is kind of subjective but nonetheless *


1. I think buy backs are in place to secure their market share, temporarily support price, and to show confidence to the market.

2. I want to think they don’t dump onto new investors, bc that seems like it would be counterproductive long term. In my head though I always envision corporate greed and would have to say Yes they dump them.

3. This is one that originally made me post this. Personally I can seem them being a position that was taken on xx date, but as inflation and the fed move in the buy backs become more of a lifeline for the value of stock instead of an asset to create gains from.

4. I think yes they prey on workers.

5. I think short term they are negative but if held and used as a hedge could become a huge positive.

 July 22 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc [**(TWTR.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/TWTR.N) on Friday blamed its ongoing battle to close its $44-billion acquisition by Elon Musk and a weakening digital advertising market for a surprise fall in quarterly revenue and a net loss. The results come as Twitter has sued Musk for dropping his offer to buy the company, and is now preparing for a legal showdown in a trial set to begin in October. The deal uncertainty has worried Twitter's advertisers and caused chaos inside the company. Advertising revenue rose just 2% to $1.08 billion, missing Wall Street expectations of $1.22 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Total second-quarter revenue, which also includes revenue from subscriptions, was $1.18 billion, compared with $1.19 billion a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $1.32 billion. ""Twitter is now in the unenviable position of convincing advertisers that its ad business is solid regardless of how its court battle with Musk ends, and its Q2 earnings show that the platform has its work cut it out for it to do that,"" said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at research firm Insider Intelligence."|0.94|1042|0|1042

t3_w4wvcv|1658450992|investing|The Economic Consequences of Jerome Powell|"(National Review) -- Due to his data-driven monetary-policy approach, the Fed chairman's 'soft landing' is looking less likely.

Jerome Powell  risks going down in history as the Federal Reserve’s worst chairman  since Arthur Burns, who brought us runaway inflation in the 1970s.

He risks doing so by first having kept monetary policy too loose for  too long as he waited for clear signs of inflation to actually show up  in the data. He thereby lost control over inflation and added to an  asset-price bubble. He now risks allowing the same data-driven approach  to cause him to slam on the monetary-policy brakes too hard to regain  control over inflation even at the likely cost of a deep recession.

Last year, the Fed clung to the belief that the inflation we were  experiencing was a transitory phenomenon. It did so despite early  indications that the combination of the largest peacetime budget  stimulus on record and an ultra-loose monetary policy would soon lead to  economic overheating. Instead, the Fed insisted that, before it  considered normalizing its monetary-policy stance, it would await data  showing that inflation expectations were becoming unanchored.

These views led the Fed to keep interest rates at their zero lower  bound and continue buying $120 billion a month in Treasury bonds as well  as mortgage-backed securities through most of last year. The net result  was that inflation surged to a multi-decade high while bubbles formed  in the equity, housing, and credit markets. Equity valuation reached  highs experienced only once before in the last hundred years while  housing prices increased to levels above those in 2006 even in  inflation-adjusted terms.

Fast-forward to today, we find that the Fed is making the same  mistake that it made last year but in reverse. Now with each higher  inflation print, the Fed is accelerating the pace of its monetary-policy  tightening. It is doing so without waiting to see the results of its  earlier monetary-policy actions.

This approach is inducing the Fed to now raise interest rates in  75-basis-point steps rather than by the more normal 25 basis points,  even though there are clear signs that the economy is on the cusp of a  recession and that inflationary pressures are abating, as indicated by  the sharp drop in international commodity prices. It is also inducing  the Fed to remain committed to withdrawing $95 billion a month in market  liquidity through quantitative tightening, even though equity and bond  markets are wavering.

Among the indications that the economy is already slowing are the  Atlanta Fed’s estimates that this past quarter the economy might have  contracted for a second quarter in a row. Other indications of slowing  are the decline in consumer sentiment to its [lowest level on record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-10/us-consumer-sentiment-slumps-to-record-low-on-inflation-woes?sref=KgEBWdKh)  because of high inflation, the crumbling in housing demand as a result  of higher mortgage rates, and the loss of export competitiveness on  account of a strong dollar.

As if a weakening economy were not reason enough for the Fed to  exercise caution in slamming on the monetary-policy brakes,  international commodity prices are declining sharply across the board.  They are doing so in anticipation of a weakening global economy. Over  the past two months, international oil, copper, lumber, and wheat prices  have all declined by over 20 percent. This very likely means that U.S.  consumer-price inflation has already peaked.

If aggressively raising interest rates at a time when the economy is  on the cusp of a recession makes little sense, withdrawing large amounts  of liquidity at a time when the equity- and credit-market bubbles are  bursting makes even less sense. Since the start of the year, not only  have the NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 lost around 30 percent and 20 percent in  value, respectively, but the bond market, too, has lost around 20  percent while the cryptocurrency markets have lost some 70 percent.

The steep decline in financial-market prices is bound to have a  meaningfully negative impact on the economic outlook. It will do so by  having wiped out over the past six months an estimated combined $15  trillion in household financial wealth. Feeling poorer, households must  be expected to cut back their spending in an effort to rebuild their  depleted savings.

All of this makes it all too likely that history will not treat  Jerome Powell kindly. First, he brought us multi-decade-high inflation.  Now he seems to be going out of his way to ensure that the economy has a  hard landing.

t3_w4wb5k|1658449389|investing|UPDATE: It seems that the market is finally beginning to realize that Citi is ridiculously underpriced|"On June 23rd, 2022, I submitted a post on here titled ""How on Earth is Citi's Stock Price so Low!?"":

[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/vjbd4l/how\_on\_earth\_is\_citis\_stock\_price\_so\_low/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/vjbd4l/how_on_earth_is_citis_stock_price_so_low/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

I strongly recommend reading through what I wrote and also some of the comments. I basically made a case for buying Citi since it seemed ridiculously underpriced. I backed my predictions with DCF analysis and such.

Anyways, I'm posting this because it seems that many of my predications have since come to fruition. For some reason, many believed that Citi's Q2 financials would be underwhelming due to inflation and such. Therefore, in the weeks before Citi released their Q2 financials, Citi's stock price fell to prices as low as $43/share. However, as I pointed out in my original post, rising interest rates are **good** for banks like Citi. Then on July 15th, 2022, Citi released their Q2 financials and the stock price has since soared from $43/share to prices currently around $52/share. Citi's Q2 performance wildly exceeded expectations, largely due to rising interest rates being profitable for them.

I apologize if this comes off as conceited. I don't mean to brag.

However, even with this sudden spike in price, it still seems a bit undervalued. In my original post, using DCF Analysis, I arrived at an ""intrinsic value""/intrinsic share price of $254.68/share. Not only that, but even in my ""worst-case scenario"" future free cash flow projections, I still arrived at an ""intrinsic value"" of $56.55/share. Both of these values are higher than the current share price.

However, as many comments in the original thread pointed out, it's probably not a good idea to use DCF analysis to value banks. Many suggested using the dividend discount model (DDM) instead. Using the DDM model, I came up with an intrinsic value of $70.16/share, which is far closer to the actual price. But that still means that the stock is still moderately undervalued.

Many in that thread also suggested other methods to calculate an intrinsic value such as P/E and P/B. Seeking Alpha multiplied consensus analyst estimates for FY22 by the average valuation multiples for P/E, P/B, and P/TBV of Citi and its peers, and calculated a price target of $81.13/share. This can be found in the Seeking Alpha article titled ""Citigroup Q2 Earnings: Outperforming Peers And Expectations""

They also seem to agree that the stock is still undervalued.

However, there are some reasons why Citi might not be a good buy. This year, Citi decided to freeze its dividend hikes to build its capital buffers. This stagnating dividend may deter investors from this stock despite their financials improving. However, its dividend yield is still at 3.92%, making it one of the highest in the industry. But this dividend freeze is due to a relatively poor Stress Test results, with Citi displaying lackluster capital buffers. This is a reason to think more carefully before deciding whether to go all in on Citi. But that seems like a minor issue in the grand scheme of things.

Warren Buffett recently invested an **enormous** amount of money into Citi. His ""stamp of approval"" bodes well for the future of this stock.

Overall, Citi is still a good buy. It would be very surprising if its price does not increase to $80+ in the near future. What do you guys think? Is Citi a good buy?"|0.38|0|0|0

Hello! :)

i want to put aside a portion of my portfolio für some time (months). i live in germany and i don't trust the euro. i need something else

i thought about this a bit and tried to narrow my ideas down a little bit in terms of what my goal is regarding the financial instruments. 

they should be
-independent from only one currency

-low volatilit

-low correlation

-profits equal or bigger than the prime rate pf the countries central banks

i have some ideas and prediction which influence inflation in euro will stay ~5% over the next 5-7 years. the dollar has momentarily higher inföation but fed will rise interest rates and it will be under control in the next 5-7 years (lower then euro)

my conclusion

-don't buy stocks (to volatile)
-leveraged bonds (mostly government bonds) in all world currencies (usd/eur/yen)
-no inflation index bonfs (because current inflation will decrease over time)
-gold (not that volatile and low correlation)
-derivates to hedge against bond prive volatility


does my plan makes sense and is it understandable? what are your iseas? i need tips which instruments can achieve my plan. i'd like something like

-leveraged 10yr treasury notes etf + hedge
-leveraged swiss government etf not hedge , i think it will stay strong 
-gold with otm put options, heding 1/2 of my gold position against drawdowns

is my concept inherintly logical? do you have maybe ideas which instruments (isin) i can use?"|0.42|0|0|0

* Mortgage demand fell last week, hitting the lowest point since 2000, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

* Buyers have lost considerable purchasing power as rates have almost doubled since earlier this year.



The pain in the mortgage market is only getting worse as higher interest rates and inflation hammer American consumers.

Mortgage demand fell more than 6% last week compared with the previous week, hitting the lowest level since 2000, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index.

Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 7% for the week and were 19% lower than the same week in 2021. Buyers have been contending with high prices all year, but with rates almost double what they were in January, they’ve lost considerable purchasing power.

“Purchase activity declined for both conventional and government loans as the weakening economic outlook, high inflation and persistent affordability challenges are impacting buyer demand,” said Joel Kan, an economist for the MBA.

While buyers are less affected by weekly moves in interest rates, the broader picture of rising rates has already taken its toll. Mortgage rates moved higher again last week after falling slightly over the past three weeks.

The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($647,200 or less) increased to 5.82% from 5.74%, with points increasing to 0.65 from 0.59 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. That rate was 3.11% the same week one year ago.

Demand for refinances, which are highly rate sensitive, fell 4% for the week and were 80% lower than the same week last year. Those applications are also at a 22-year low, but the drop in demand from homebuyers caused the refinance share of mortgage activity to increase to 31.4% of total applications from 30.8% the previous week.

Mortgage interest rates haven’t moved much this week, but that could change very soon due to increasing bond market volatility. The Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates by another 75 basis points next week, and other central banks are taking similar action against inflation. A basis point equals 0.01%.

“This is especially true next week as markets digest the newest Fed policy announcement next Wednesday, but Thursday’s policy announcement from the European Central Bank could also cause enough of a stir to impact U.S. rates,” noted Matthew Graham, chief operating officer of Mortgage News Daily.

The article says inland logistics problems are being exploited by dominant ocean carriers, who own the shipping containers, through detention (failure to return shipping containers) and demurrage (port storage from failure to pick up shipping containers) fees.  The carriers are blaming the importers (using the port as extra storage space since their warehouses are full) and trucking companies (shortage of drivers).  The marine ports themselves are partly to blame (e.g. containers can only be picked up or returned by appointment and a container can only be returned if they pick up another due to lack of space).  The containers can't be picked up until all fees are paid and after any customs inspections.  Congress approved a bill to give the Federal Maritime Commission more power over the shipping industry, and the commission has handed out some fines, but they're small compared to the industry's profits.

It seems like a real big mess but how accurate is the article?  Are the carriers mostly at fault here or is it everybody?

I went to the 3 free seminar, and during that time learning a few new things I didnt know about before mainly slippage that occurs between your broker - middleman- institution.  There was some other stuff, but that was interesting to learn about.  

They have their trading platform called Clik, and they are not a brokerage firm. 

I did sign up for a 3 day training seminar, cost 100 dollars, but you get back a 50 dollar gas card.. so my cost really is 50 dollars for a 3 day , 9 to 5 classroom,  using Clik, but also learning about trading stocks, options, futures, forex, and they added in a free crypto currency class, if you signed up before end of this month. 

ya ya its all marketing and some place making money, sure I know.   But for 50 dollars, to enhance knowledge and learning hands on, in person is more my style.  Of course there is a caveat , to go through the extended academy, it costs a whole lot more, like 8500 dollars for the one part, and over 20,000 dollars for the other part..  

 Let me say this right away, I am not, I repeat, I am not going to pay that kind of money.  But I will take full advantage of 3 full days of training and learning for 50 dollars.. that is worth it to me.

(Financial Times) -- Elon Musk says he needs more time to prepare for courtroom showdown over his attempt to back out of $44bn deal

Elon Musk has accused Twitter of an “unjustifiable request to rush” the trial to determine whether he should be forced to complete a $44bn deal to buy the social media company.

Musk has suggested a trial start in February at the earliest, according to a court filing from his lawyers on Friday. That is several months later than the September timing being pushed for by Twitter in its lawsuit, which was filed in Delaware chancery court just days after Musk announced his intention to terminate the deal.

Lawyers representing the Tesla chief executive on Friday said in the 16-page response to Twitter’s lawsuit that the question of spam accounts on the network — one of the primary reasons Musk has given for attempting to back out of the deal — was “fundamental” to the case and required lengthier investigation and “substantial time for discovery”.

Musk’s lawyers described the proposed trial date, and the suggestion by Twitter it could be completed in four days, as being on a “breakneck schedule”.

“Twitter’s sudden request for warp speed after two months of foot-dragging and obfuscation is its latest tactic to shroud the truth about spam accounts long enough to railroad defendants into closing,” the filing read.

A hearing on the matter is due to be held on Tuesday. Twitter declined to comment.

The social media company’s lawsuit accused Musk, the world’s richest man, of trying to back out of the deal on account of the rout in tech stocks that has hurt the value of Twitter and many of its peers. On July 8, when Musk announced his intention to back out of the deal worth $54.20 per share, the stock had fallen to $36.81.

In a case that has captivated the corporate world, Musk’s defence rests on his ability to convince the court that the issue of bots — automated spam accounts — on the platform is far greater than previously disclosed, representing a “material adverse effect” that would give him the ability to back out of the deal.

Musk has alleged Twitter had breached the merger agreement by not sharing sufficient information on fake accounts, a position reiterated in Friday’s filing, which again questioned the company’s long-stated estimate that bots made up less than 5 per cent of users.

Following a meeting between Musk and Twitter’s chief executive Parag Agrawal, “Musk was stunned to discover that Twitter’s process for identifying spam accounts relied on human reviewers to eyeball a minuscule portion of the userbase rather than utilising the company’s machine learning capabilities”, the filing said.

In its lawsuit, Twitter argued Musk had been well aware of the site’s issue with bots, pointing to tweets posted by Musk highlighting the matter prior to the deal.

The social network also accused Musk of breaching the terms of the merger agreement that demanded he not disparage the company, by highlighting his tweets that appeared to be goading Twitter’s leadership.

Addressing that claim, Musk’s filing accused Twitter of being unable to take a joke.

“With the sense of humor of a bot, Twitter claims that Musk is damaging the company with tweets like a Chuck Norris meme and a poop emoji,” the filing stated. “Twitter ignores that Musk is its second-largest shareholder with a far greater economic stake than the entire Twitter board.”

I’m talking about long term investing with monthly dollar cost average tracking a large index like S&amp;P 500. 

From what I know, comparing both Index Fund ETFs vs Index Funds:
- Most companies don’t have minimum initial investment for index funds, this means I can start off with $10 investing in index funds. ETF can be bought fractionally which also means I can start investing with $10 so there isn’t a difference here. 
- Expense ratio seems to be almost the same/negligible (0.01% difference). If a company has their ETF’s expense ratio cheaper than their index funds, chances are I can find a competitor company with index funds’s expense ratio being similar or cheaper if I really cared about that 0.01% difference. 
- Investing for the long term means I don’t bother too much about timing the market within the day, I just invest the same amount every month till I retire. 
- A lot of these new fintech companies allow automatic withdrawal from my back account even if I’m investing in ETFs; otherwise, spending 5 minutes a month transferring money is no big deal.

&gt; The following US entities are generally treated as partnerships for US tax purposes:-

&gt; * Limited Liability Companies (LLCs);
&gt; * Limited Partnerships (LPs);
&gt; * Subchapter S Corporations;
&gt; * Publicly Traded Partnerships (PTPs), often also referred to as Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).

&gt; These investments can sometime be recognised by their names which may end in “LLC” or “LP”. However the suffixes “Corp” and “Inc” are sometimes used therefore it is best to check the prospectus to confirm whether the entity is a partnership or corporation.

&gt; The tax treatment of the sale of US partnerships can be extremely complicated for a non-US investor.  All of any capital gain, or only a part of it, may be subject to US tax on sale, depending on various factors which are broadly intended to limit the taxable gain to the extent of the partnership’s business operations in the US.

&gt; The partnership is required to withhold US tax both in respect of annual income and also when the non-US investor sells their shares.  In addition the non-US investor is required to file an income tax return to report the annual income, and again when the shares are sold.

Quotations are from: https://uk.andersen.com/non-americans-investing-in-us-publicly-traded-partnerships/

Do you think that because of this MLPs may get undervalued?

Or big investors who have money to hire accountants to deal with the form and get ITIN (if needed) will correct the market price?"|0.57|2|0|2

I definitely never knew where the actual dividend payment per share comes from but it makes sense now. For those that aren't aware, you can look at 'Historical Data' of a security and see Open, High, Low, Close and 'Adjusted Close'. Look through the data until you find a dividend, and you'll see that dividend payments just come from the price of the stock. If the security is worth $50, and the dividend is worth $1/share, the adjusted close for that evening will be $49. It's value that we already hold that is being distributed back into our pockets as a check.

So with that said and learning more about dividends, are they actually beneficial to investors? Do they actually lead to more wealth growth?

If their valuation is fair then this seems like it could legitimately be a good option but if they're going to give themselves a head start by lowering their valuation then they're going to take a lot more in the long run in most cases (the house appreciating).  

In my case, I am investigating using them to fund a rental property.  Seems that with the income earned from the rental property plus the equity and appreciation on that property, I'd be able to out-earn Hometap's take?  But then again maybe that's naive.  They are a bank after all.  Why wouldn't they just buy the properties themselves?"|0.75|9|0|9

t3_vzfywx|1657860385|investing|Mega Backdoor Roth Rollover Question|"I know each 401k plan is different, but do there exist plans where the following is possible: 

- I contribute after-tax dollars into 401k
- After-tax dollars are automatically converted to the Roth bucket of 401k (""in plan conversion"")
- I rollover the after-tax dollars now in the Roth bucket, to a Roth IRA (while still being employed at the same place) [???]

I am unsure if the third step above is possible? The advantage would be that I could withdraw my contributions from the Roth IRA whenever, whereas withdrawing contributions from the Roth 401k seems tricky.

Reflections
- The best place to get your 401k questions answered is your 401k provider (Fidelity, in my case). There was almost no wait-time for calling Fidelity. 
- There is a chance you may run into consultants over the phone who aren't super knowledgeable (maybe they're just starting out etc). In this case, just call again; eventually you'll run into a consultant who really knows what they're doing and can support you adequately
- The ""401k Summary Plan Description"" document contains most, but not all, the information you need about your 401k plan
- In my Summary Plan Description document, there is no explicit language to the effect of ""in service withdrawal/distribution"". However, it seems like my plan still offers this feature. Again, call Fidelity/your provider when in doubt

Conclusions (pertaining to my specific 401k plan - yours may be different)
- It is possible to rollover voluntary after-tax 401k contributions directly to a Roth IRA. However, it is not possible to automate this process (regardless of what 401k plan you're on). I will necessarily have to call Fidelity every other week (after I receive my paycheck), to request transfer of after-tax contributions to Roth IRA
- Roth 401k != Roth IRA. If I wish to have tax-free Roth growth of my investments, and I want access to my contributions penalty-free, I need to ensure that my after-tax contributions get to my Roth IRA. This is because when you withdraw from a Roth 401k, it is not possible to specify that I want to withdraw exclusively from my contributions (unlike with a Roth IRA). Necessarily, the Roth 401k withdrawal will involve a combination of contribution + earnings. The earnings will therefore be subject to the early-withdrawal penalty + tax. 
- I can always, as proposed in the initial scenario of this post, do the following: after-tax &gt; Roth 401k &gt; Roth IRA.
- Note that the in service Roth 401k &gt; Roth IRA rollover is *only* possible for the after-tax funded portion of my Roth 401k. That is, I cannot rollover paycheck Roth 401k contributions to Roth IRA.

The process makes sense for the most part.. a company wanting to go public, hiring an investment banker, filing a registration statement with SEC, creating a prospectus &amp; marketing the IPO, and now I'm at the point of learning about IPO allotment.

So I'm having some trouble understanding why IPOs become oversubscribed. I get that it happens when the demand for shares is higher than the number of shares initially being sold in the IPO, which leaves investors with only a fraction of what they asked for while others will be left with nothing.

How do people get left with a fraction or even nothing? When it reaches the IPO date and the new shares go public, is it not a first come first serve process that happens in real-time? How does it become so swamped that others either get pushed out for less or completely to the side with nothing at all? Is the system not capable of selling out all the IPO shares to people who come first, rejecting everyone else, and leaving the company to decide if it needs to issue more shares?

So full disclaimer, I have zero knowledge of this company or Switzerland banking or Switzerland at all. But from just looking at the chart, the stock is at all time lows. The price is currently lower than it has ever been in 10 years by about double ($10). Even during Covid, the shares were higher, at $6.80 at the depths of it all.


Why is the stock down?

Basically it boils down to lack of confidence and lack of leadership after the bank suffered two big losses, Greensil and Archageos. Greensil was a SoftBank backed venture that provides financing for companies while they wait for vendors to pay their bills. Typically businesses pay invoices within 90 days of the purchase. This can be tough when you need the money to continue operations. Anyway, Greensil lost its insurance and all the sudden, the entire model which was essentially risk free, became risky and everything was halted and without cash flow, Greensil and the companies relying on it end up stuck. CS had urged their clients to provide capital to Greensil… You see where this is heading. People lost money. 

Archegeos Capital features brave trader Bill Hwang who was able to convince banks and institutions all over the world to provide him with insane amounts of credit and leverage. Problem is no one knew just how much risk he had taken on. Turns out, it was closer to $125b. Credit Suisse suffered over a $5b loss when this venture imploded, the most of all lending parties involved by at least double. 



So what’s the play here?

Remember 2016-2019, all the losses and bad press about Deutsche Bank (DB)? DB at its lowest in 10 years which was during the Covid crash was $4.99 per share. The stock rebounded to $15 about a year later, and now sits at $7.67. Credit Suisse is the new Deutsche Bank. 

Also Switzerland has basically two premiere banks, UBS and CS. My entire thesis is centered on this continuing. One side gains and losses power/momentum but eventual the pendulum reverses. Recession or not, Credit Suisse is not going bankrupt, so the natural assumption turns to price and that the stock will return to $7-10, if not $15. My best guess is within the next few months for the first, and maybe a year or two before we see $10-15. 

The stock will be dead money for a few months. But the upside is clearly there. At $5 it’s a dirt cheap bet, even cheaper on margin ($1.15 per share, 100 share lot) if you have conviction. You can also buy 2024 10c options for $0.20 or atm calls for $1.25."|0.32|0|0|0

China - bans exports of Phosphate
Russia - can't export Potash
Europe - Nitrogen = Nat gas sky high price. 

Input costs alone will cripple Europe and Asia. First, by making food more expensive, as well as making land less productive as smaller farms skimp on fertilizer. Spiraling food shortages will produce famine first in Sub Saharan Africa and then Asia. 

Agricultural Wheat

Wheat - Russia Largest producer in the world.
Ukraine 4th Largest producer in the world. 

Russia is in the process of systematically destroying the farmland in Ukraine. This will have LONG lasting production consequences. 

Food costs rise. Again, famine first in Africa, then Asia if they don't import Russia wheat. 

Boomers Retire.

Global labor Shortage. 

Zoomer Smallest Generation cannot replace them. 

2022 = 400k shortage. Labor costs go UP. Keeping inflation running for years. 

2034 = 900k shortage.  This is mathematics. Not speculation.

Europe has less Gen Z and Millennials to replace Boomers. So they're lives are going to be hit hardest with recession and stagflation. 

China and Russia are screwed because of total population collapse. 

US consumer has 2 trillion in savings. That's a LOT of demand. 

Two ways to lower inflation:

Suppress Demand/ Increase Supply

Fed cannot raise rates fast enough. But demand continues. 

Supply MUST increase, but how with lower workforce? 


Dollar Denominated Commodities

Oil .Nat Gas , Food.
Fertilzer. Iron ore, Boxite

Prior to this year a common conclusion in recent research from firms like Vanguard, JP Morgan, et. al is that the 60/40 would have anemic returns over the next decade due to high equity and bond prices combined with historically low yields.

2022 has definitely started out that way sure.  Bonds have provided little protection during a time of high inflation and rising interest rates.

However I am wondering if, once inflation peaks (whenever that may be), the current drawdown in the 60/40 has actually improved the outlook for expected returns in the future on this portfolio allocation compared to what much of the research on this was forecasting just a year or two ago.  Obviously this hinges a lot on what happens with inflation, rate hikes, earnings, etc. over the next year or so.

Beta - investor takes on systemic risk of the portfolio. A rational investor would prefer less volatile to more volatile stocks if the expected return was similar, therefore the market rewards the one who takes on more risk

Size - small caps are inherently more risky than large caps. Given the same returns, a rational investor would prefer large caps, therefore the market prices in the risk and the return for small cap investors

Growth - value caps are inherently more risky almost by definition because the risk is basically priced in their valuation. Any rational investor would prefer a company with better growth given the same returns, therefore the market prices that in

Investment - companies that invest more into their future are more attractive and a rational investor would prefer them given the same returns, so that it’s priced in

Profitability - this is the part I wasn’t quite able to understand. Companies with robust gross profit tend to outperform those less profitable. Given the same returns, wouldn’t rational investors prefer to invest to into companies with larger profit margins?

Lawyers for the San Francisco-based company say they need only four days in Delaware Chancery Court to prove that the world’s richest man should be forced to honor his agreement and pay $54.20 a share for Twitter. The company hopes to start the non-jury case on Sept. 19. Legal experts, however, predict the case will take about two weeks to try.

Unlike some states where it can take several years to get a case to trial, Delaware Chancery Court generally moves quicker. Chancery judges -- business law experts -- are known for being able to parse through the legal thickets of complex merger and acquisition disputes more quickly and thoroughly than other US courts. Even complex business cases are often argued before a judge within six or seven months of being filed.

The Twitter buyout agreement specifies all legal disputes over the deal must be heard in Delaware, corporate home to more than half of U.S. public companies, including Twitter and Musk’s Tesla Inc..

Musk and his lawyers didn’t immediately return emails Tuesday seeking comment on both the suit and whether the case can be tried on Twitter’s schedule. Musk did issue a tweet Tuesday, saying: “Oh the irony lol.”

A judge hasn’t yet been assigned to the case, but Chief Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick already has taken on investor suits over the teetering transaction. She may pick up Twitter’s suit as well. McCormick, a Delaware native, is a former legal-aid lawyer and graduate of Notre Dame Law School.

Twitter’s legal team argues it can easily show in less than a week of court time that Musk didn’t have legitimate grounds to nix the $54.20-per-share buyout. Twitter shares rose 8.1% to $36.83 at 3:01 p.m. Wednesday.

“Litigation on the schedule Twitter proposes permits the parties and their experienced counsel ample time to assemble a trial record,” the lawyers wrote.

That would provide enough time for a judge to rule and have the Delaware Supreme Court review the ruling before the Oct. 24 closing date for the transaction, the lawyers said.

Charles Elson, a retired University of Delaware finance professor and former head of the school’s Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, says don’t bet on it.

“I’d say a four-day trial is way more than optimistic,” Elson said Wednesday in an interview. “There’s a lot of water under the bridge on this deal and I’d say it going to take more like 10 days to try it.”

Last year, Musk traveled to Delaware for over challenge from Tesla investors to his more than $2 billion purchase of renewable-power provider SolarCity, a company he founded with his cousins. That case ate up 10 trial days. A judge ultimately concluded Musk didn’t force an overpriced SolarCity acquisition down the throats of his fellow Tesla directors.

I’m kinda confused part about the relationship of beta and returns:

&gt; In a study published in 1992, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French divided all traded stocks into deciles according to their beta measures over the 1963-1990 period. Decile 1 contained the 10 percent of stock had the lowest betas, decline 10 container the 10 of that had the highest betas. The remarkable result… there was no relationship between the return of these decile portfolios and their measures.

Isn’t stock’s beta and it’s return just a matter of definition? I.e. if $1 invested into us total stock market index in 1963 was worth $2 in 1990, and stock A cost $1 in 1963 and 1990 it cost $3 then by definition it had a beta of 2. And therefore it’s returns as well were double of the total market. So, beta 2 = 2x return. A different stock B with beta 1 would have return have half that of stock A in the same period. And there you go, a pretty linear relationship, just based on definition alone

One thought that pops into my head was the relationship is between beta “expected returns” and not beta vs “returns”. I.e. if you compare the stock beta if last 6 months vs expected returns in the next 6 months on a rolling basis, then the relationship becomes a lot more complicated. The concept of “expected returns” has already been introduced in the book tho, so I’m confused why it doesn’t specify that

Series 2 pays a floating monthly dividend based on the Canadian prime rate (most recently at a rate equivalent to $0.92/share, based on the last distribution of $0.0767).  The BOC raised rates by 100 basis points, so this will very likely increase (I project - based on simple math that may not be accurate -  $0.976/month, or $1.17/share annually).

Series 3 pays a fixed quarterly dividend, resetting every five years (corresponding with the exchange date).  BBD [just announced](https://bombardier.com/en/media/news/bombardier-announces-dividend-rate-applicable-its-series-3-preferred-shares-2) that, as of August 1, the dividend will be $1.147/share annually (if my math is right).

As of time of this writing, BBD.PR.B is trading at $16.80, and BBD.PR.D is trading at $17.99.  From that sense, there appears to be almost an arbitrage opportunity (probably technically not.. but maybe as close as regular investors can hope for :) ) for owners of BBD.PR.B.

The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 2½%, with the Bank Rate at 2¾% and the deposit rate at 2½%. The Bank is also continuing its policy of quantitative tightening (QT).

Inflation in Canada is higher and more persistent than the Bank expected in its April Monetary Policy Report (MPR), and will likely remain around 8% in the next few months. While global factors such as the war in Ukraine and ongoing supply disruptions have been the biggest drivers, domestic price pressures from excess demand are becoming more prominent. More than half of the components that make up the CPI are now rising by more than 5%. With this broadening of price pressures, the Bank’s core measures of inflation have moved up to between 3.9% and 5.4%. Also, surveys indicate more consumers and businesses are expecting inflation to be higher for longer, raising the risk that elevated inflation becomes entrenched in price- and wage-setting. If that occurs, the economic cost of restoring price stability will be higher.

Global inflation is higher, reflecting the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, ongoing supply constraints, and strong demand. Many central banks are tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, and the resulting tighter financial conditions are moderating economic growth. In the United States, high inflation and rising interest rates are contributing to a slowdown in domestic demand. China’s economy is being held back by waves of restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. Oil prices remain high and volatile. The Bank now expects global economic growth to slow to about 3½% this year and 2% in 2023 before strengthening to 3% in 2024.

Further excess demand has built up in the Canadian economy. Labour markets are tight with a record low unemployment rate, widespread labour shortages, and increasing wage pressures. With strong demand, businesses are passing on higher input and labour costs by raising prices. Consumption is robust, led by a rebound in spending on hard-to-distance services. Business investment is solid and exports are being boosted by elevated commodity prices. The Bank estimates that GDP grew by about 4% in the second quarter. Growth is expected to slow to about 2% in the third quarter as consumption growth moderates and housing market activity pulls back following unsustainable strength during the pandemic.

The Bank expects Canada’s economy to grow by 3½% in 2022, 1¾% in 2023, and 2½% in 2024. Economic activity will slow as global growth moderates and tighter monetary policy works its way through the economy. This, combined with the resolution of supply disruptions, will bring demand and supply back into balance and alleviate inflationary pressures. Global energy prices are also projected to decline. The July outlook has inflation starting to come back down later this year, easing to about 3% by the end of next year and returning to the 2% target by the end of 2024.

With the economy clearly in excess demand, inflation high and broadening, and more businesses and consumers expecting high inflation to persist for longer, the Governing Council decided to front-load the path to higher interest rates by raising the policy rate by 100 basis points today. The Governing Council continues to judge that interest rates will need to rise further, and the pace of increases will be guided by the Bank’s ongoing assessment of the economy and inflation. Quantitative tightening continues and is complementing increases in the policy interest rate. The Governing Council is resolute in its commitment to price stability and will continue to take action as required to achieve the 2% inflation target."|0.95|209|0|209

Shoppers paid sharply higher prices for a variety of goods in June as  inflation kept its hold on a slowing U.S. economy, the Bureau of Labor  Statistics reported Wednesday.

The consumer price index, a broad  measure of everyday goods and services, soared 9.1% from a year ago,  above the 8.8% Dow Jones estimate. That marked another month of the  fastest pace for inflation going back to December 1981.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The explosion in environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) investing has led to strong reliance on ESG ratings providers—and questions about the reliability of those ratings. This is not surprising given that trillions of dollars are at stake in ESG investing. A research paper by MIT Sloan School of Management research associate [Florian Berg](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3579819-1&amp;h=2894518048&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fmitsloan.mit.edu%2Fstaff%2Fdirectory%2Fflorian-berg%3Fmsclkid%3D34479c19ab7911eca4f7c145c0f60973&amp;a=Florian+Berg) and Kornelia Fabisik and Zacharias Sautner of the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, validates these concerns, as they discovered ""widespread and repeated"" changes to the historical ESG scores by a leading vendor of this data.   
&gt;  
&gt;Berg says, ""The incredible growth of sustainable finance has created a billion-dollar market for ESG data. Yet, we found that the data is not reliable or consistent. The changes made in ESG scores at any particular time in history are massive.""  
&gt;  
&gt;He explains that the data for any specific point in time should remain the same for a firm unless there is a documented reason for a retroactive change. However, their study revealed significant unannounced and unexplained changes to the data provided by [Refinitive ESG](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3579819-1&amp;h=2880314828&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.refinitiv.com%2Fen%2Ffinancial-data%2Fcompany-data%2Fesg-data&amp;a=Refinitive+ESG), which was previously owned by Thomson Reuters. For example, looking at two versions of the same Refinitive ESG data for identical firm years – one from September 2018 and the other from September 2020 – the median overall scores in the rewritten data were 18% lower than in the initial data.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The score rewriting leads to large changes in what are deemed to be high- or low-ESG firms. This is important because the classification of firms is widely used in ESG research and the investment industry,"" says Berg, cofounder and research associate of the [MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative's Aggregate Confusion Project](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3579819-1&amp;h=3574784543&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fmitsloan.mit.edu%2Fsustainability-initiative%2Faggregate-confusion-project%3Fmsclkid%3D344913b5ab7911ec8f630780683a8302&amp;a=MIT+Sloan+Sustainability+Initiative%27s+Aggregate+Confusion+Project).  
&gt;  
&gt;In their paper, the researchers highlight how firms that performed better in a given year experienced upgrades in their E and S scores for that year through the data rewriting. Using predictive regressions, they showed that investing in firms with higher ESG scores in the initial data would not have led to economically or statistically significant performance gains. Yet, in the rewritten data, they found economically large, statistically significant positive effects of the E&amp;S score on the firm's future stock returns.  
&gt;  
&gt;""These large differences matter because this performance would not have been possible with the data available to investors when forming their investment strategies,"" says Berg.  
&gt;  
&gt;He notes that the data rewriting occurs on an ongoing basis without any public announcements. To show this, the researchers compared ESG scores from February 9 and March 23, 2021 – just six weeks apart – and found that 85% of firms' scores changed. While the score changes were mostly small in magnitude, the ongoing retroactive changes affected the classification of firms and the link between ESG scores and returns.  
&gt;  
&gt;Berg says, ""Our study highlights the incentive of the data provider to introduce a positive relationship between ESG scores and returns in the data to demonstrate that their ESG scores are useful for data users developing ESG-related investing strategies. Investors should always beware and conduct due diligence, but this is particularly critical with ESG ratings."""|0.92|214|0|214

I guess the intention is to help developers get enough equity in a project to qualify for traditional financing and then they take a subordinated debt position. In other words, a bank finances 75% of the cost and they come in and cover the remaining 20-25%. They form an LLC for each investment project. 

• How do they pay a fixed return to investors during development?
• During the development phase, no money would be coming in, so do they accumulate interest and pay it all with long-term take-out financing at the end?
• Are these investments always for development, or would an investment company want to keep an apartment complex or commercial real estate property in their portfolio after it is built? Or even buy an already completed building?

It sounds like these investment companies are relatively common, but I’m not sure exactly how they work. I have a good grasp on traditional bank financing, but this is a different approach."|0.76|8|0|8

For context, the fall out rate from home buying contracts hovered at a steady \~12% for three years leading up to the Pandemic. Homes are now falling out of contract 14.9% of the time for June 2022. This is not a dramatic fall-out rate yet but I think it will be interesting to keep an eye on. It seems buyers are more likely to have contingencies and are either forced to pull-out (because of higher interest rates) or not afraid to pull out of a contract.

[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220711005232/en/Home-Sales-Are-Getting-Canceled-at-the-Highest-Rate-Since-the-Start-of-the-Pandemic](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220711005232/en/Home-Sales-Are-Getting-Canceled-at-the-Highest-Rate-Since-the-Start-of-the-Pandemic)

This of course does not mean the housing market will crash but at the very least it seems we are going back to a balanced market where buyers at least have room to negotiate contingencies such as inspection.

In addition, it might also mean that Buyers were not able to lock in a lower interest rate for long enough after putting in an offer, and unable to afford the newer higher rate by the time closing happens."|0.95|1104|0|1104

Sean Snaith, national economist and director of UCF's Institute for Economic Forecasting, said that the country is in for a year-long recession in his latest U.S. Economic Forecast.

Snaith said that the recession may be what is needed to solve the inflation problem.   A ""pasta bowl recession,"" due to its *low and shallow* shape.  

""While the recession may not be deep, he expects it to likely last four quarters – representing the wide part of the bowl. He predicts the mild slowdown should help the Federal Reserve bring inflation to heel while giving the global supply chain time to return to normal and allowing gas and oil prices to come down,"" a report from UCF says.

Other predictions:

Payroll job growth of 3.7% in 2022 will turn negative in 2023, fall to -0.3%, and fall further to -1.0% in 2024 before turning slightly positive at 0.6% in 2025.

Housing starts will decline from 1.6 million in 2022 to 1.4 million, then hover at this level through 2025.

11.4 million job openings will provide a shock absorber for the impact of the recession on the labor market. The headline unemployment rate is expected to rise from 3.6% in 2022 to 6.5% late in 2024 before beginning a gradual decline in 2025.

With more people switching to organic foods and healthy food choices like plant-based foods, the emphasis on healthy eating has followed suit. The younger generation, which is more inclined to spend more on higher-quality, healthier foods, is where this transition is most noticeable. Additionally, customers worldwide are putting more of an emphasis on health, environmental sustainability, and ethical eating practices, which has created new market niches within the food sector. Due to the millennial generation's preference for sustainability, healthy food stocks are on the rise, which has given investors a ton of new chances

By 2025, the global market for food solutions, according to Bank of America, will be worth more than $300 billion. The sector is being impacted by factors including the growth of plant-based proteins, autonomous food and grocery delivery, animal health, and organic farming. In 2020, 57 percent of US households purchased plant-based goods, according to a report by the Plant Based Foods Association. Additionally, the nation's total sales of organic and health food increased by 27% to $7 billion. According to Research and Markets, the US market for plant-based meals will expand at a CAGR of 9.69 percent through 2027.

Numerous food firms have risen to the top as a result of the increased demand for sustainable and healthy food options. For instance, the US retail sales of Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ: BYND), which went public in 2019, increased by 27% in the first quarter of 2021. Current market expansion for Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ: BYND) includes China and several regions of Europe. The quarter's net sales increased 11.4 percent to $108.2 million.

By providing a broad selection of natural and organic items under the brand name Annie's, General Mills, Inc. (NYSE: GIS), a US grocery behemoth, has made tremendous advancements in the sector. The company also owns the Cascadian Farm brand, which is one of the top sustainable and healthy food stocks to buy because it uses sustainable agricultural production methods. The hybrid model of conventional and organic food goods that General Mills, Inc. (NYSE: GIS) uses include price points that are accessible to most consumers. Due to the rise in demand for household food items during the COVID-19 epidemic, sales in the company's organic food division increased by 7% during the quarter.

The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. is a different business that has experienced substantial growth (NASDAQ: HAIN). Given that the company's shares increased by almost 24 percent over the previous 12 months, it is one of the best-performing companies in the market for healthy foods. The demand for The Hain Celestial Group, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: HAIN) natural food items is increasing as more customers choose a sedentary lifestyle. The business's Yves Veggie Cuisine brand has already gained recognition by delivering cutting-edge plant-based goods without the use of flavorings or artificial additives.

PlantX ([VEGA.CN](https://VEGA.CN)) platform is the one-stop shop for everything plant-based and serves as the online face of the plant-based community. The business provides customers in North America with more than 10,000 plant-based goods in quickly expanding category verticals. The company, which is not only restricted to an e-commerce platform, now has plans in place to expand its product lines to include cosmetics, apparel, and its own water brand, in addition to providing meal and indoor plant deliveries. It provides education and, more significantly, cultivates a community of like-minded customers through its digital platform. Its thriving business is based on alliances with leading chefs, dietitians, and brands.

https://www.justetf.com/servlet/download?isin=IE00BDFK1573&amp;documentType=MR&amp;country=GB&amp;lang=en

Seeking to explain this. Best theory I have come up with is that because the hedged fund uses forward contracts to hedge their currency exposure, they have to pay to a fee equivalent to the interest differential (which rate exactly?) between the 2 currencies. So if the level of interest on the Euro is significantly lower (it is, but again not sure which rate I'm referring to exactly), the fund will be taking a notable loss.

But then if that is true, it makes a mockery of the idea of using currency hedging on short duration bonds, because the positive interest differential you are trying to capture will mostly get wiped out by the negative cost of carry incurred in hedging the currency exposure.

t3_vv2ggx|1657375603|investing|Is Commercial Real Estate a Systemic Risk?|"Hello,

I would like to discuss the risk of a deleveraging event in the commercial real estate sector.  It seems there are a combination of headwinds that are hitting this market all at once.  Could this be the equivalent of the 2008 housing crisis?  Is residential real estate the potential systemic risk that arises from Fed policy tightening and residual impacts of COVID?

Let's just examine some of the risks facing the commercial real estate industry:

* Commercial Real Estate tends to be in high-traffic areas, meaning it commands a higher price per square foot than residential or other types of real estate
* Commercial RE is comprised of several subsectors, including Office, Retail and Hospitality
   * These subsectors are somewhat interdependent.  That is, high-traffic areas depend on office workers to support restaurants and hotels nearby.  Retail as well, to a lesser extent.
* Commercial RE tends to be financed in shorter duration than residential.  Commercial RE loans tend to average around 5 years in length.  They will often be structured differently as well, one popular format being a ""balloon structure"", where the lender pays regular payments for the duration of the loan, then a large lump sum for the remainder at maturity.
* Interest rates have been increasing rapidly and steeply to combat inflation, greatly increasing the cost of financing, especially compared to the past 2 years post-COVID.
* The work-from-home movement has displaced workers from offices, and has resulted in companies moving out of higher cost areas in favor of lower cost areas (for ex. from SF to Atlanta)
* Work-from-home is more prominent and durable in white collar office jobs, which tend to be in the most desirable areas (downtown major cities)

**Retail**

* Increasing number of retail transactions done online
* Brick &amp; mortar retail is in a long term and likely permanent downtrend
* Even the consumer staples retailers like Walmart, Target just had their worst quarter possibly ever.  Imagine how the less established players are doing.
* Now imagine how they will do if we have a long term recession

[https://www.commercialsearch.com/news/manhattan-falls-on-lowest-vacancy-list/](https://www.commercialsearch.com/news/manhattan-falls-on-lowest-vacancy-list/)

It's no question we are entering a recessionary environment.  Many companies are entering crisis mode.  Some of the most impacted industries are technology, biotech and consumer discretionary.  Raising more capital via equity is now extremely unfavorable for these companies.  Their valuations have been decimated.  Many companies have lost 80%+ (TDOC, PTON, PYPL, DOCU, RBLX, ETC ETC).

Similar decimation in the venture capital markets.  There's just very little capital being deployed at the moment.  And that is likely to continue for the near future as the Fed continues interest rate hikes and the market continues its risk-off trend.  There is low potential upside in the near-term, because any significant recovery in equities would put pressure on the Fed to tighten further.

There was too much excess capital.  It needs to be washed out.  That doesn't happen overnight.  Not from these levels.  There is little reason for excitement in the near term.  The Fed has to ensure inflation stays low, and they will require more than a few lower CPI prints to feel satisfied.

So with all that said, all forms of assets are in a pretty violent repricing at the moment.  Real estate has been more stubborn to drop, but it is already coming under pressure.  US residential real estate has less impact.  There is a supply shortage of homes.  There are lots of potential buyers on the sidelines hoping for prices to drop.  Most homeowners refinanced during the Pandemic and locked in low interest rates for 20+ years.

So even if residential drops, it should be relatively uneventful.  The residential market can absorb a correction.  Commercial is a different story.  Real estate is highly-leveraged in general.  No one comes in and buys a property for cash.  Especially in a zero interest rate environment like we had just a year ago.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CREACBM027NBOG](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CREACBM027NBOG)

There's an estimated $2.6 Trillion in commercial real estate loans outstanding.  Who is going to backstop those loans in a deleveraging event?  The banks?  You think the banks are gonna come in and take those properties?  The banks are in no position to absorb a commercial real estate collapse.

This isn't 2008.  There is no ""easy"" way out of this.  You can bail out these commercial RE loans, but it doesn't fix the underlying problem.  These properties as they exist today are decreasing in utility.  Many will need to be converted into residential / other.  There is simply way too much office space, and probably way too much retail as well.

In 2008, the housing crisis was just an issue of writing too many mortgages and packaging them as high quality products.  The houses itself weren't the problem.  People still needed houses then as much as they did before, and as much as they do today.  Technology has not displaced the need for a house.  In fact, due to work-from-home, it has increased the budget for the average consumer's house.

Commercial does not have that same intrinsic necessity.  Stores have found a ton of new real estate... online.  Offices have moved... online.  All the businesses that went into supporting the traffic involved in those types of properties are at risk.  

So get ready.  This could be the ""big one"" that defines this market cycle.  If commercial starts going down the toilet, it will be a systemic risk and it will extend all across the market.  IMO it is the first thing that ""breaks"" from the Fed continuing to hike rates."|0.79|28|0|28

Bonds probably went up a little since 10 year yields dropped from around 3 to around .5, but I can't find a price chart, just a yield chart. Did anything work?"|0.79|51|0|51

t3_vuoh7q|1657324586|investing|Thoughts on Target Date funds?|"When I first rolled over my 401k into an IRA, I chose to invest 2/3 of it into a target date fund (the remainder went into VOO) because I thought a target date fund would be a smart/safe choice. That fund is down 24% in the past year, lost all of its 3 yr gains, and is now priced under its original inception price. VOO, otoh, is only down 10% and up +37% over the past 3. 

Looking back through the lens of time and lessons learned, I'm reconsidering whether I should bother with a target date fund at all. I like the idea of a target fund that automatically shifts towards conservative and then income as you approach retirement, but now that I've gained knowledge and am actively monitoring my investments, I feel I might be better off exiting the target date fund and spreading it over a few different index funds and migrating to conservative/income myself when the time is right. I'd also save a bit on expenses - the one I have is on the low end for similar funds, but far greater than index ETFs. 

I guess my question is - is there any reason to believe that a target date fund is potentially going to outperform index funds like VOO or be less volatile over the next 20-30 years? Is this a no-brainer decision or am I missing some benefit to target date funds?"|0.74|7|0|7

Hi r/investing I am a finance student currently enriching my knowledge about corporate valuation and was wondering what some opinions are on financial leverage when deciding to invest in a company. Does high leverage always scare investors? Or does it not really matter as long as its business model is fine? 

Also do people stil take a look at business models or do they just stick to the leverage ratios (e.g. debt ratio, debt to equity, equity ratio)?

From what i understand market makers take the other side if a party enters into a future contract and than hedge their position, but if the future market is x times bigger than the stocks available, how can this work as there are not enough stocks available to meet the demand of the future market and market makers to hedge their position?

I’ve spent the better part of an hour googling and can’t really answer my question very well and hope you can help me.  

I am invested in a biotech company who’s listed on the nasdaq that’s currently around $1 per share.  They have patents and research, but monetization hasn’t happened.  This has always felt like it’s just waiting for a buyout from a larger company who can take the patents and work and commercialize/monetize it.

So my question becomes, how would a company buyout work in relation to the stock price?  I have not really found a good “this is what typically happens” stock price model.

For example, say the acquiring company agrees to buy all the outstanding stock for $5 a share?  What happens to the current stock’s value?  

Or, say the acquiring company’s stock is $100 a share.  They offer a 20-1 stock swap (basically the same $5 per share in acquiring company’s stock.)

I assume these are the two most likely scenarios, but is there another scenario that is typical?  Which one of these scenarios (or whatever else) is better or worse for me as the shareholder?

Can someone direct me to a decent website or graphics that can help me out please?

Thank you in advance!"|0.38|0|0|0

t3_vtnvb4|1657214470|investing|Negative compounding interest equal to positve simple interest - what does it mean?|"I was trying to find equivalences of some simple returns to what would the interest rate be if they were compounded in different frequencies over the same period and I realized the equations (I.e. this compound interest - the simple interest should be 0 for the rates to be equivalent) have negative valid roots often (or complex, but I don't wanna go there even).

That doesn't make a lot of sense because negative interest rates won't ever compound to positive returns, so I was wondering if this has any kind of financial interpretation.

The calculation:

So, the formula for compound interest is `A = P (r/n + 1)^(tn)`

Imagine you have a total capital after investment A'. The equivalent compound interest you can calculate by doing `A' = A = P(r/n + 1)^(tn)`. Which you can calculate by filling in the data and calculating the roots where

    P(r/n + 1)^(tn) - A' = 0

To give you an example. I invest 10000€ and when I close that investment I have 11000€, say after 5 years. I want to calculate how much yearly compound every month interest is that, so I solve for r:

    10000 * (r / 12 + 1) ^ (5 * 12) - 11000 = 0

That's a degree 60 polynomial equation, so it has 60 different solutions. Most of them complex. But you can substitute for `c = 0.0190` or `c = -24.0191` to see that both give you a solution to the equation.

So apparently -2400% interest rates are equal to a 10% return in 5 years.
