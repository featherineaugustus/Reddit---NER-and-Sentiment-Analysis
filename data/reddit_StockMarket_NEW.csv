t3_xcr34g|1663023963|StockMarket|Analysis of Harley Davidson (HOG) - Possible Short Idea|"Harley-Davidson (HOG) derives value from four revenue streams:

* The core motorcycle business;
* Financing through Harley-Davidson Financial Services;
* Apparel; and
* The Livewire electric motorcycle division.

Breaking down Harley-Davidson in that simple manner highlights the intriguing case for shorting HOG stock. Every aspect of the business seems under potential pressure.

Harley-Davidson’s financing profits are already declining and are at further risk amid an increase in both interest rates and credit losses. Apparel manufacturers of all stripes are struggling after sales were pulled forward by the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Meanwhile, Livewire is going public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company AEA-Bridges Impact (IMPX). The general track record of so-called de-SPAC mergers and the specific valuation assigned to Livewire in that tie-up both suggest potential downside. That apart, the idea that Livewire much expands the total addressable market for motorcycles — required for a benefit to Harley as a whole — seems questionable.

To some extent, the market is pricing in these pressures. HOG trades at about 9x this year’s consensus earnings per share estimate. But that’s still a premium to most companies facing similar challenges. That premium exists because the stock has had a strong 2022, gaining 9%.

In the context of its various revenue streams, even that modest rally looks questionable. So does that seemingly cheap valuation, given mid- to long-term risks and a reasonably leveraged balance sheet. With the Livewire SPAC due to close this month, and the chart suggesting a near-term top, there’s a solid case for shorting HOG here.

## The Motorcycle Problem

The risk to Harley-Davidson earnings is not what it was pre-pandemic. It’s much, much worse.

The 2010s bear thesis was that Harley-Davidson earnings were peaking, for two broad reasons. One was that competition was rising, notably from the relaunch of Indian Motorcycles by Polaris (PII). But the far more important reason was that Harley was facing a demographic time bomb.

Harley was a ‘baby boomer’ brand, and by the end of the decade Baby Boomers ranged in age from 55 to 73. Millennial preferences, as noted in a 2019 analyst note highlighted by CNBC, [pointed away from Harleys](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/actually-young-people-really-could-kill-harley-davidson.html). In a response to CNBC, Harley’s PR team didn’t even dispute that finding, telling the network that “there’s nothing new here.”

That mid- to long-term headwind still remains. But particularly at this valuation, it’s not quite enough to support a short thesis.

What can support a short thesis is a post-pandemic reversion to the mean. To be sure, in terms of revenue, Harley-Davidson is not Peloton (PTON). Guidance for a 5-10% increase in sales this year for the HDMC segment (which includes not only bikes but apparel, licensing, and parts &amp; accessories) suggest motorcycle sales will be only modestly above those generated in 2019, and still below 2018 levels. That’s a moderate improvement in trend, certainly, but it’s possible that Hardwire-driven decisions are driving that improvement.

Where the reversion to the mean is a threat is in terms of profit margins. The midpoint of 2022 guidance suggests a 300 bps expansion from levels reached in 2018, and 520 bps from 2019. Harley’s own Investor Day presentation highlights one core reason why:

https://preview.redd.it/477l2g3wdin91.png?width=664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7074cf14a3029acffe15a7316aa508309847b83d

Management would argue (and has argued) that Hardwire is responsible. In their telling, discounting has been reduced because the company is selling the models its end customers desire.

To some degree, management no doubt is correct. But few, if any, management teams of consumer-facing businesses have attributed recent strength to external factors. (That only happens when the external factors are negative.) At the least, Harley’s pricing strength — which has allowed it to pass on inflationary increases to purchasers, and then some — just happen to coincide with similar strength at nearly every other consumer-facing business out there.

Indeed, one of the arguments against boating and RV companies in the mid-term is that anyone considering a purchase in either industry would have made their purchase over the past two-plus years. It’s difficult to believe that doesn’t apply to Harley-Davidson to at least some extent.

Even assuming the consumer holds up, the stronger dollar alone may force Harley’s hand. Japanese rivals took advantage of the weaker yen to [compete on pricing](https://www.reuters.com/article/harley-davidson-dollar-discounts/at-harley-and-beyond-strong-dollar-offers-competition-discount-edge-idUSL1N0XI1PE20150421) in the mid-2010s. With the yen down 23% over the past year, they have every ability to do so again.

At the very least, Harley-Davidson needs to ramp up advertising in a more normalized environment. Reductions there have been enormously beneficial to margins already. Advertising spend in 2021 was $107.6 million, or 2.37% of motorcycle segment revenue, against $171.4 million in 2019 — 3.75% of sales.

There’s another, more immediate factor at play, however. As an analyst highlighted earlier this year, Harley has [reduced dealer margin](https://powersportsbusiness.com/top-stories/2022/03/18/analyst-on-harley-davidsons-dealer-margin-reduction/), in large part because bikes are selling at or even above MSRP (manufacturer’s suggested retail price). That decision alone adds 2.5 percentage points to bike profit margins, likely providing a 100-plus basis point boost to operating margins.

If and when pricing strength fades, however, there’s a potential double whammy on the way. Harley — which under Zeitz already [reversed its decision](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/24/harley-davidson-abandons-its-amazon-storefront/) to sell on Amazon.com (AMZN) amid a dealer uproar — might have to reinstitute the prior 20% margin.

Again, Harley is not Peloton. In terms of motorcycle sales, the impact of a return to normalcy actually seems far less than for boats or RVs. Relatively stable parts and accessories revenues can minimize the impact of sales weakness as well.

But, overall, there seems to be a strong case that the quick margin expansion over the past two years is coming from external factors rather than internal improvements. The bearish argument from before the pandemic — that margins and profits had peaked — still has validity after the pandemic.

## Apparel Growth

The same argument may well apply to apparel. Harley-Davidson doesn’t give much color on apparel profit margins, but the bottom-line contribution of the category no doubt is material.

In 2021, apparel only accounted for 5% of revenue, and licensing about 0.8%. But margins in both categories no doubt are huge. Dealer margins for apparel appear to be in the range of 40%, which still leaves plenty of room for a huge markup: Harley’s short-sleeve T-shirts sell [for $30 to $40](https://www.harley-davidson.com/us/en/shop/c/mens-t-shirts-polos?format=json;i=1;locale=en_US;q1=mens-motorcycle-clothes;q2=mens-t-shirts-polos;sp_cs=UTF-8;x1=primaryCategoryCode;x2=superCategoryCodes). Licensing margins, meanwhile, likely clear 80%, given the lack of operating expense required.

If apparel EBIT margins are 15%, and Licensing 80%, then the two categories probably account for a high-single-digit portion of overall operating income. (Our simplistic and potentially conservative model here suggests the proportion is about 8%.)

Here, too, the pandemic appears to have been a boon. 2022 performance, given strong first-half growth (+21%), should come in \~10% ahead of 2019. But that growth is a marked change in trend: apparel (the category was then named “General Merchandise”) fell 1.8% in 2019, 7.9% in 2018, and 7.7% the year before. The same broad reversal is seen in the licensing category as well.

Admittedly, Harley’s merchandise businesses continue to perform well even at a time when most other merchants already are seeing demand fall off. It’s possible that execution has improved (management doesn’t offer much commentary on either business), or that demand here is more resilient.

But it’s also possible that the category simply is getting a residual benefit from bike sales that are higher than they would be otherwise. New bikes often mean new merch. As with the profit margin improvement for the segment as a whole, this seems the more likely explanation: that what Harley management believes is permanent, structural improvement is actually just a pandemic-driven tailwind that is set to fade.

## Financial Services Reversion

It’s been the financial services business that has been a big contributor to growth from 2019 to this year:

https://preview.redd.it/07v51u8ydin91.png?width=664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72649b46be19520110a827851463ad24c652d3d7

Historically low loan losses last year, as well as a release of a valuation allowance, drove record profitability in the Financial Services segment last year. Harley expects a 20-25% decline this year — but the figure remains elevated.

More downside seems likely. Unit sales are down. Interest rates are up. A simple return to average performance from 2012-2017 — which, bear in mind, was a beneficial environment, if not to the extent of 2021 — suggests an EBIT decline of $50 million. That alone suggests a $0.26 after-tax hit to EPS, or about 6% of this year’s earnings. Any actual downturn in the economy, or a pile-up from consumers who were overconfident about borrowing in 2020-2021, suggests further downside if HDFS profits move below the past trend.

## Does Livewire Really Help HOG?

In 2022, Livewire expects to sell 500 units. In 2026, the projections from the S-4 estimate the figure will rise to 100,961.

At this point, few if any investors put much faith in SPAC projections. But it’s worth putting that 2026 figure in the context of Harley-Davidson’s current unit sales. In 2021, the company shipped 188,494 bikes, 461 of which were electric.

So if the math is that Harley-Davidson’s stake in Livewire is worth $1.7 billion, then that division has to be taking material share from legacy ICE (internal combustion engine) models. Yes, perhaps Livewire can expand the overall market, helping to ease some of Harley’s difficulty in reaching younger consumers. And the company is selling its STACYC electric bike for children, which appears to be driving early unit sales and revenue.

But even accounting for STACYC in the unit numbers, Livewire can’t get to 100K without existing bikers. The idea that tens of thousands of bikes can be sold to customers who would totally ride a motorcycle except for the fuel source is almost ludicrous. Unlike electric automobiles, fuel savings aren’t that material; ICE motorcycles are relatively efficient as is. Electric engines offer benefits in terms of maintenance and repair, a marginal help considering the reputation of Harleys as unreliable (though [it’s up for debate](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-28/are-harley-davidsons-too-reliable-) as to whether that reputation is justified).

The biggest problem with a motorcycle is that it’s less safe than traditional automobiles and, for most potential customers, not viable as a primary mode of transportation[1](https://www.overlookedalpha.com/p/harley-davidson-stock-run-out-gas#footnote-1). An electric bike perhaps can get some new customers into the market, but overall ICE and electric broadly are serving the same market. LiveWire management said as much at their company's Investor Day, emphasizing that ""we must win with experienced riders."" Some of those experienced riders would otherwise buy Harley ICE models.

And so if LiveWire really is worth \~$1.8 billion, that’s only because it has an opportunity coming from legacy Harley’s growth going forward. If it isn’t, that’s good news for Harley’s mid-term profits, but far less so for a potentially valuable balance sheet asset.

We’d lean strongly toward the latter expectation, but either way there are offsets here. Some of the value Livewire creates has to come from Harley’s ICE business.

## Why Short Now?

Overall, then, the profile here looks like a short. 2021 and 2022 profits are elevated against a 2018 baseline — and that baseline is held amid a positive external environment (strong economy, low interest rates both in the U.S. and overseas). Simply returning to that kind of environment seems to get non-Livewire EPS under $4 (\~200 bps in EBIT margin compression); any kind of pressure from inflation and/or recession does even more damage.

When and if the pre-pandemic narrative about demographics returns in force, HOG probably still receives a sub-10x multiple to those profits. And so a mid-30s or worse share price seems easily in play.

Admittedly, that’s not huge downside from Friday’s close above $41. This is more of a trade/funding short. But there are two core reasons to see that kind of play as attractive here.

The first is the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/pz8my8e1ein91.png?width=664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d4f0d06e3578fad2c5161c9321045598c4bb97a

We’re not regular proponents of technical analysis around here, but resistance clearly has held going back to last year. And in this case, the reticence to pay even a double-digit multiple for the stock suggests a lack of confidence that is meaningful.

The second catalyst is that the Livewire SPAC merger should close toward the end of this month. It’s certainly possible that redemptions are high and what will be LVW stock falls quickly. Warrant pricing [remains relatively weak](https://www.aeabridgesimpactcorp.com/stock-data/impx-ws), and despite a few flurries of optimism, de-SPACs as a whole continue to underperform.

The upside risk here, essentially, is that management is right, that Hardwire is transformative, and that some version of the bull case thus plays out. Market-based risks are less worrisome. The cost to borrow is minimal, and this is no longer the semi-crowded short it once was. (4.37% of the float currently is sold short.) We’ve talked recently about the danger of “meme stock” rallies, but the ‘Boomer’ nature of the brand is probably what makes HOG less likely to join that list of mostly consumer names.

It’s possible management is right. But the management team of every single consumer-facing pandemic winner thought it was their companies’ execution and product that were driving top-line growth and margin expansion. It wasn’t. It was cheap money and a flush consumer.

For Harley-Davidson, it likely wasn’t any different. We will now see what this turnaround looks like without multiple external tailwinds. The history of both Harley-Davidson last decade, and the entire consumer business this decade, suggest it will look far, far worse.

t3_xcqxo4|1663023593|StockMarket|New Oil Sands Bitumen Technology Coming Online|"In a world desperately in need of more and better energy sources, areas like the oil sands of northern Alberta play a crucial and controversial role in the energy supply puzzle. Processing the heavy, tar-like crude bitumen extracted from these sands into more transportable and refineable synthetic crude oil (SCO) is a necessary step on the way from the fields to the refineries. It’s called upgrading, and the current technologies used in the process are either very expensive or not very efficient.

[Aduro Clean Technologies Inc.](https://adurocleantech.com/) (CSE: ACT) (OTCQB: ACTHF) (FSE: 9D50) [recently announced](https://adurocleantech.com/company-update/aduro-announces-readiness-of-scaled-up-continuous-flow-bitumen-reactor-for-customer-trials/) the imminent completion of its pilot-scale Hydrochemolytic™ continuous flow bitumen reactor. The company’s [Hydrochemolytic™ platform](https://adurocleantech.com/hbu/) is a patented, water-based technology that operates more efficiently and less expensively than the current methods for upgrading bitumen. Hydrochemolytic technology also has applications that could [revolutionize plastic recycling](https://adurocleantech.com/hpu/) and other upgrading processes that[ turn wasted renewable oils](https://adurocleantech.com/hru/) like corn and canola into renewable products like biojet fuel. Here we will focus on the technology’s potential impact on the oil refinery industry. 

**Bitumen Upgrading 101**

The bitumen that comes out of Alberta’s oil sands and similar deposits around the world can be used close to its ‘natural’ tarry state for paving and roofing applications. It contains high levels of asphaltenes and similar compounds that make it very heavy, and unable to be transported via pipeline. To make it into the lighter SCO, bitumen can be upgraded by either removing carbon or adding hydrogen. Carbon is removed by coking - high temperatures are applied to bitumen to crack it into lighter oils and natural gas liquids while also creating a solid, carbon-rich byproduct called coke. Coking units can cost in the $500 million to $1 billion range to build.

Hydrogen is added through hydroconversion, an upgrading process where the bitumen is cracked and combined with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, such as platinum, at high pressures. As hydrogen is added to the bitumen, with no carbon rejection, the volume of synthetic crude oil produced from hydroconversion could be equal or more than the volume of bitumen consumed during the process. Hydroconversion is both more expensive and more complex than coking while producing higher yields.

In 2020, there were [four active upgraders](https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/market-snapshots/2022/market-snapshot-a-tour-of-canadas-oil-sands-upgraders.html) in Alberta and two nearby in Saskatchewan. These facilities processed 42% of the 3 million barrels/day of Alberta bitumen produced that year, yielding 1.1 million barrels/day of SCO. The economics of building and expanding upgrading facilities have become increasingly problematic, and oil sand production is still on the upswing.

**The Aduro Difference**

Aduro’s patented Hydrochemolytic™ platform utilizes a water-based chemical conversion process with a number of advantages over the systems widely used today. The technology is highly scalable and significantly less expensive to build than the coking and hydroconversion facilities noted above. It also operates at a lower temperature, with lower energy needs, while greatly reducing the need for dilutive hydrocarbon substances in the upgrading process. Hydrochemolytic™ processing also results in greatly reduced emissions, making the oil produced ‘greener’ than that created by conventional methods. It can even be applied to the lowest grade bitumen left over from these conventional methods in refineries, essentially turning waste into a much higher value and usable oil.

In the current stage of development, Aduro is completing its R2 Bitumen reactor on a pilot scale. The company has been building to this moment, with [previous accomplishments](https://adurocleantech.com/company-update/aduro-completed-work-on-its-first-milestone-and-submitted-a-report-for-third-party-evaluation-a-critical-step-towards-commercialization-of-their-innovative-chemical-conversion-technologies/) including the implementation and testing of small-scale batch reactors (R1) and the testing of a pre-pilot R2 continuous flow reactor. The continuous flow approach marked a significant leap forward from the initial batch-by-batch R1 reactors.

“Results achieved with the continuous-flow R2 pre-pilot reactor exceeded expectations. Compared to batch mode, it delivered equivalent upgrading results more quickly and at lower temperatures, and with lower catalyst loading. We had already proven HCT in small-scale R1 batch reactors, but the efficiency of HCT in R2 increased by a factor far greater than 10. This significantly strengthens our projections regarding lower operating costs in commercial applications, along with improved scoring on environmental factors, such as reduced emissions and energy consumption,” said Marc Trygstad, CTO of Aduro.

The pilot project is slated to be fully operational by the end of October or so, and features an upgraded vapor-liquid separator that increases the technology’s versatility in terms of what types of feedstock it can handle. In anticipation of demand for customer trials, Aduro is [significantly upgrading its lab facilities and testing capabilities](https://adurocleantech.com/investor-relations/aduro-expands-and-upgrades-lab-facilities-to-accelerate-research-and-scale-up-capabilities/) to make the trials as efficient and effective as possible. 

**Where It’s All Headed**

Aduro Clean Technologies is at an interesting inflection point in its corporate development. The R2 Bitumen reactor allows the company to move into its commercialization and revenue generation phase, pending the outcome of customer trials. Aduro is already well down the road with an unnamed publicly traded company on a potential asphaltene upgrading project, and the pilot-scale reactor will allow the companies to complete the evaluation of the potential deal. 

On a parallel track, [Aduro is working on a pilot-scale R2 plastics reactor](http://www.secfilings.com/news/the-many-harms-of-plastic-and-how-to-invest-in-a-solution-408). Expected to be completed later this year, the pilot project should get the company’s plastic recycling program to a similar point of development as the bitumen project - on the verge of commercialization and revenue generation.

Both opportunities represent massive market potential for Aduro and its patented Hydrochemolytic™ platform with a combined total addressable market of over $100 billion in North America alone. If the technology proves itself on a larger scale in these pilot projects, the revenue generation could make its current \~$36 million market cap look silly. Stay tuned for further developments."|0.67|1|0|1

The filing said this is an additional investment in the LLC that acquired five Courtyard by Marriott hotels: Fairfax, Virginia (1 hotel); Baltimore, Maryland (2 hotels) and San Antonio, Texas (2 hotels). The Courtyard by Marriott hotels are franchised by Marriott International Inc

Congresstrading noted that this LLC received $1.4 million in paycheck protection program (PPP) loans as part of the federal government’s program to help struggling businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPP loan was forgiven and used for payroll according to another source.

**Good Morning!**

&amp;#x200B;

 

Unfortunately posting daily premarket sometimes becomes redundant since the bulk of the moves have been happening intraday. But today is definitely a day to look at!

SPY sitting above 406 support  
410-412 resistance overhead.

As we trade at 408 in the PM we're sort of trading in no mans land but we must remain bullish in the short term above 406

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jre4hrbvcfn91.png?width=1228&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cb2ca6d8464bb1dc443ce35b55b0cb4285c23a0

 

It's also important to remain objective, not emotionally responsive to this rally we've seen because we must still keep in mind that SEPTEMBER IS A VERY BEARISH MONTH.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/72ylzknwcfn91.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=814f7ed97ddd0fb5e854858528a40beb3d6a8213

 

Therefore it is important to remain bullish in the short term but it makes sense to start scaling into shorts for a few months out =)

We also have CPI and PPI data coming out this week.  
Trade light, pile it on after we see proper direction.

GOOD LUCK!"|0.54|1|0|1

t3_xcb0li|1662984293|StockMarket|The DOJ says Google illegally dominates the search market by paying billions of dollars to other companies. Do you agree that it is illegal?|"Google pays billions of dollars to other companies -- Apple, Samsung Electronics, etc. -- to keep its search as the default option on phones and in browsers, something the Department of Justice (DOJ) believes creates an illegal dominance over the search market.

Deals like this ensure companies like Apple stay out of the search business. The practice has gone on for years. Google, at one point, paid Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion annually to appear as the default search engine on iPhones and other Apple devices, according to a law suit filed in 2020.

DOJ attorney Kenneth Dintzer didn’t disclose the amount Google spends to remain the default search engine on browsers and U.S. mobile phones, but described it as “enormous numbers,” reports Bloomberg.

“Google invests billions securing defaults, knowing people won’t change them,” Dintzer told Judge Amit Mehta during a hearing in Washington, admitting that Google buys “default exclusivity because defaults matter a lot.”

In 2019, Google began giving Android users in Europe a choice to select a provider to power a search box on their device's home screen, and as the default in Chrome when installed. The changes complied with a competitive European Union ruling. The EU fined Google, saying it had an unfair advantage by pre-installing its Chrome browser and Google search app on Android smartphones and notebooks.

The change gave users with a phone running the Android operating system and Chrome browser an option to customize and personalize their device, choose and change their search engine based on their preference. It included selecting the apps to download.

Google, for example, added private, decentralized search engine Presearch as a default option on all new and factory-reset Android devices in the U.K. and Europe.

Since Google added Presearch 2021, its daily searches have grown from about 200,000 a day to more than 4 million, said Alex Carrabre, head of growth at Presearch. “At the peak it was 6 million per day in the past 20 months,” he said. “It’s just in the Europe economic area.”

Carrabre estimates Android has about 70% of smartphone market share in Europe, which means there’s strong potential for the fledgling search engine to grow its user base.

Google’s private contracts with companies like Apple, and Samsung form the basis of the DOJ’s antitrust lawsuit, which alleges the company has sought to maintain its online search monopoly in violation of antitrust laws.

The trial isn’t expected to start until next year. Thursday’s hearing was a daylong tutorial where each side laid out its views on Google’s business.

The DOJ says Google (Alphabet, Inc: GOOGL) creates an illegal dominance over the search market by paying billions of dollars to other companies to keep its search as the default option. How do you think this news will affect GOOGL's trading price? Do you agree that it is illegal?"|0.94|492|0|492

HIGH TIDE (ticker: HITI on Nasdaq)

GLOBAL CANNABIS RETAIL &amp; ECOMMERCE EMPIRE

INVESTOR DECK (updated 8/10/22): [https://hightideinc.com/presentation](https://hightideinc.com/presentation)

Undervalued, hidden GEM w/ visionary CEO and team. Smart strategy of rapidly expanding a global DIGITAL footprint VS just a geographic brick&amp;mortar footprint

POWDER KEG. Only \~55M share float = RAPID upside moves when sentiment towards the sector shifts back to positive

HITI Barnacles Hold Tight: [https://i.imgur.com/RrzFm50.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/RrzFm50.jpg). Why do we call ourselves ""barnacles"" ? We live in tide pools, hold rocks (&amp; shares) TIGHT, and we're HARDENED. Sharks and Whales can't eat barnacles. The smartest barnacles attach themselves to whales for a ride up.

MUST WATCH 5/19/22 Raj interview on Seeking Alpha: [https://youtu.be/VRAMOedblPs](https://youtu.be/VRAMOedblPs)

GLOBAL THC + CBD + ACCESSORIES STRATEGY

[CannaCabana.com](https://cannacabana.com/) \#1 in Canada for THC, CBD, &amp; Accessories w/ 140 stores

BlessedCBD #1 in UK, just announced delivery to Germany, USA, Italy, &amp; France. European takeover imminent!

NuLeaf &amp; FabCBD are both top CBD brands in the USA with 70%+ margins

Meanwhile, [GrassCity.com](https://grasscity.com/), [SmokeCartel.com](https://smokecartel.com/), [DailyHighClub.com](https://dailyhighclub.com/), &amp; [DankStop.com](https://dankstop.com/) are most of the top accessory websites in the world getting. $HITI has 3M High Lifetime Value customers (who bought pipes, bongs, vapes, dab rigs, etc) in a list segmented by US state, so the have the option of setting up a high profit / low overhead partnership with a (NY for example) MSO to add a ""Buy Weed"" button in any state.

Q2 2022 ER Recap

[https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-reports-second-quarter-2022-financial-results-featuring-a-98-increase-in-revenue-and-ninth-straight-quarter-of-positive-adjusted-ebitda/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-reports-second-quarter-2022-financial-results-featuring-a-98-increase-in-revenue-and-ninth-straight-quarter-of-positive-adjusted-ebitda/)

1) DISCOUNT CLUB MODEL IS WORKING. Same Store Sales (SSS) growth is up 48% since they made the switch in October(!) -- all while small shops are struggling to compete, and F&amp;F is seeing SSS contraction. Raj also said the SSS growth is continuing in Q3 so far May &amp; June so the word is getting out. The plan was always to take a small hit in Retail margins, balanced by the CBD &amp; Accessory biz, so the competition (big &amp; small) were forced to close or sell to HITI. Burn the forest and only the big trees survive.

2) CLEAR LEADER IN RETAIL Revenue: HITI 81MM vs F&amp;F 41MM

EBITDA: HITI +2.4MM vs F&amp;F -2.4MM

Gross Profits: HITI +23% vs F&amp;F -26%

Cash Flow from Ops before working capital: +1.6MM vs F&amp;F -3.4MM

3) CASH &amp; NDF UPDATE. Cash as of 4/30 was 15M so that is enough before the 30M NDF closes ""in July"" which will be used to pay off debt at \~5% AND M&amp;A -- which you know Raj &amp; team has lined up.

2021 Recap

[https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-recaps-milestones-of-2021/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-recaps-milestones-of-2021/)

Q4 / 2021 ER (1/27/22) [https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-announces-unaudited-2021-financial-results-featuring-a-118-increase-in-revenue-and-record-adjusted-ebitda-of-12-4-million/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-announces-unaudited-2021-financial-results-featuring-a-118-increase-in-revenue-and-record-adjusted-ebitda-of-12-4-million/)

Nasdaq uplisting. 4 new analysts

Opened 48 stores. 150+ by EOY '22. 200 by EOY '23

Accretive M&amp;A of 3 Accessory biz &amp; 3 CBD biz

Club membership is booming w/ new discount model causing same store sales growth $280M (CAD) run rate $80M (CAD) run rate (internationally, mostly USA)

Rolling out Fastendr kiosk tech to all stores in 2022 AND M&amp;A -- which you know Raj &amp; team has lined up.

OVERVIEW

1) FINANCIALS.

A) \~$90M (USD) market cap when the price is $1.40/share (USD).

B) Q2 ER $81+M (CAD) revenue BEAT expectations. [https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-reports-second-quarter-2022-financial-results-featuring-a-98-increase-in-revenue-and-ninth-straight-quarter-of-positive-adjusted-ebitda/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-reports-second-quarter-2022-financial-results-featuring-a-98-increase-in-revenue-and-ninth-straight-quarter-of-positive-adjusted-ebitda/)

C) After Q2 ER the revenue run rate was updated to $325M+ (CAD) in 2022 with a higher goal possible based on the pace of M&amp;A and USA partnerships.

D) Rapid expansion of stores (105 EOY '21; 150+ EOY '22; 200 EOY '23) and M&amp;A now = Big Net Profits later

2) NON-DILUTIVE FINANCING (NDF) -- Management indicated on the Q2 ER call that a $30M NDF will be closed in July/August [https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-executes-letter-of-intent-for-30-million-non-dilutive-credit-facilities-with-connectfirst-credit-union/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-executes-letter-of-intent-for-30-million-non-dilutive-credit-facilities-with-connectfirst-credit-union/)

3) ANALYSTS w/ BUY RATINGS. It's not just about the 5 ""BUY"" ratings and the PTs -- these analysts host ""roadshows"" (giving them access to Raj, the team, and the facilities) and distribute their in-depth reports to all their institutional clients.

4) M&amp;A targets are always in a loaded deal pipeline. Negotiated several accretive deals on CBD &amp; Accessory businesses to round out their diverse THC, CBD, &amp; Accessory cannabis biz ecosystem:

5) ETFs (MJ, YOLO, THCX, BUDX, MJXL) hold &amp; add. MJ ETF has accumulated millions of shares over several months, so they own \~8% of the float.

6) INSTITUTIONS went from 0 to \~30 institutions in just a few quarters. Institutional ownership went up 420% from Q2 to Q3, and another 106% from Q3 to Q4 -- with far more Calls than Puts. New institutions quietly buying in Q2 was revealed mid-May.

INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP %: [https://stocktwits.com/MungyboyStocks/message/461856619](https://stocktwits.com/MungyboyStocks/message/461856619)

CALLS/PUTS: [https://stocktwits.com/MungyboyStocks/message/461858005](https://stocktwits.com/MungyboyStocks/message/461858005)

NOTE: Institutions have a much easier time owning HITI vs an OTC listed MSO because they are listed on the Nasdaq with no grow operation -- which allows them to get past their compliance department. \*

7) VALUATION. Undervalued. \~.5 P/S which is extremely low compared to other retailers like Dollarama, MSOS, and especially LPs. NASDAQ-listed Canadian LPs are unprofitable cash-burning machines, powered by dilution &amp; delusion. MSOS can't as much institutional love stuck on the OTC.

RAJ IS A SELF-MADE (BEAST) CEO

Raj is the biggest shareholder (\~6.5M!) and has never sold a share.

He started this company with $40k and one store and grew it into the empire you see today. And he isn't slowing down.

He wasn't handed millions which he squandered paying themselves and their friends first or expanding too much too fast.

He is shrewd. Smart. Strategic. Charismatic. Transparent. And he does whatever he says he is going to do, when he says he is going to do it. That's rare.

You bet on visionary leaders like that.

That's why there are 4-5x as many watchers on StockTwits than any USA MSO.

The passion we feel is contagious. It's only a matter of time before more institutions and retail investors realize what we already did and trust Raj to take us to the promised land.

NULEAF NATURALS ACQUISITION SIGNIFICANCE

[https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-continues-expansion-into-global-cbd-market-with-acquisition-of-colorado-based-nuleaf-naturals/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-continues-expansion-into-global-cbd-market-with-acquisition-of-colorado-based-nuleaf-naturals/)

Located in Denver CO, NuLeaf Naturals is one of the top CBD brands in the USA in terms of CBD-blend research &amp; IP, rapid growth, and industry-leading margins. $16M of the \~$20M revenue is direct-to-consumer, but the expanding agreement with Sprouts will allow for wider B&amp;M retail distribution.

It's notable that their facility is cGMP certified. It can generate up to 60,000 vegan soft-gels per hour, which is 25% of their business. Production, co-packing, &amp; shipping of FabCBD was moved to the facility for cost savings through operational efficiencies.

Once USA legalization allows, High Tide hinted that this facility could also create THC infused edibles and drinks.

DISCOUNT CLUB MODEL STRATEGY

[https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-becomes-north-americas-first-cannabis-discount-club-retailer-with-over-245000-members/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-becomes-north-americas-first-cannabis-discount-club-retailer-with-over-245000-members/) (as of the 7/28 PR, it's now 670K+ members)

DATA DRIVEN decision based on successful pilot programs

Membership in this loyalty program is FREE ...for now. Every person who walks into a Canna Cabana sees a high cost for non-members, and a discounted cost for members. When they realize signing up for FREE with their email address and phone # (SMS) makes them a MEMBER of the CABANA CLUB, they will do so in order to save money on that purchase and future purchases.

Stores are stocked w/ HIGH MARGIN products like consumption accessories, FabCBD &amp; Blessed CBD, (VERY soon) house brands of shatter &amp; gummies &amp; prerolls -- with other form factors later.

Same store sales are way up Q over Q while the other retailers are seeing declines.

\*\*This is a DATA and MARKET SHARE / CUSTOMER LOYALTY grab from other retailers and the black market by running them out of business. When the time is right, High Tide has indicated they will monetize this membership -- most likely with Free, Premium, &amp; VIP type paid memberships for max discounts &amp; benefits

EXAMPLE: Let's say High Tide decides to monetize their membership when they have 1M members. 1/4th of those members (250K) sign up for the $5/mo / $60/year plan. That's $15MM in profit that goes straight to the bottom line.\*\*

FASTENDR

[https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-to-acquire-fastendr-retail-kiosk-and-smart-locker-technology-through-acquisition-of-bud-room-inc/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-to-acquire-fastendr-retail-kiosk-and-smart-locker-technology-through-acquisition-of-bud-room-inc/)

Watch Video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oTvTrTSnn4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oTvTrTSnn4)

Discount model is causing long lines out the door. Taking a page from leading retailers in other sectors, this allows customers to order online or at a kiosk, and pick up from a ""smart"" locker. For those customers who know what they want and don't need the budtender's guidance, this is a slick convenience. Very few dispensaries in the world have this experience.

Also mentioned in the PR is the desire to license this tech to other dispensaries and industries which could turn into yet another revenue stream.

Delivery will be made available in as many location as allowed by law, but this offers a fast, convenient, slick way of ordering / picking up. It also cuts down on $$$ spent on budtenders while keeping lines moving.

With plans to expand in Europe, I could envision a smaller ""Bud Room"" store concept that almost feels like a vending machine. While not discussed in the press release, the stigma of cannabis still exists worldwide, so some might be turned off by the idea of being seen in line waiting at a dispensary. Side benefit worth mentioning.

Overall, while this will increase profitability, this changes the perception of the company stock to THC + CBD + Accessories + Data&amp;Tech -- which should help command higher multiples.

CATALYSTS Barnacles like to see develop

A) NON-DILUTIVE FINANCING. Allows rapid expansion without just issuing shares. Should close in July/August. [https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-executes-letter-of-intent-for-30-million-non-dilutive-credit-facilities-with-connectfirst-credit-union/](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-executes-letter-of-intent-for-30-million-non-dilutive-credit-facilities-with-connectfirst-credit-union/)

B) NEW DISCOUNT CLUB MODEL + PRIVATE LABEL LAUNCH. 2.0 products (launching soon!) &amp; CBD will mega-boost margins.

C) FUNDAMENTALS improving through rapid store opening&amp;maturation and M&amp;A aligned w/ eCommerce domination STRATEGY. 3M+ high lifetime value customer emails + data + social across USA = most valuable asset

D) LEGALIZATION ""working-on-it"" headlines sparking another forward-looking cannabis sector bull run. Most institutions can't invest in USA MSOs stuck on the OTC (likely several more mo), so they invest in NASDAQ companies w/ higher valuations. And we all know HITI's superior fundamentals, valuation, &amp; profit projections stack up very well vs LPs &amp; comps

E) MORE ANALYSTS &amp; INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS

F) NARRATIVE shift from LP to RETAIL. See: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSdyhx11iJM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSdyhx11iJM)

G) USA STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP. Online &amp; B&amp;M. Read: [https://mjbizdaily.com/how-canadian-cannabis-retailer-high-tide-plans-to-enter-united-states/](https://mjbizdaily.com/how-canadian-cannabis-retailer-high-tide-plans-to-enter-united-states/)

""RETAIL SATURATION / COMPETITION"" CONCERNS(?)

People worried about ""saturation"" don't get that big boys like High Tide are the ones that will benefit in the long run. Mom &amp; Pops will get run out of business due to margin pressure. Meanwhile High Tide uses their position to negotiate better prices, which only serves to accelerate this process. Then High Tide gets to buy the best locations based on data while letting the underperformers close their doors.

Coffee shops close. Starbucks gets bigger/stronger.

Department stores close. Target gets bigger/stronger.

Taking pages from the playbooks of Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and Grocery Stores is how HITI will win in this Retail game.

Burn the forest and only the big tree survive &amp; thrive. High Tide is engaging in a price war it knows it can win because of its diverse streams of revenue.

GROWTH &gt; STAGNATION

The entire cannabis sector is in rapid growth mode. Top operators do all they can to expand their geographic footprint. They use cash, loans, and shares to buy &amp; build assets that allow them to sell cannabis in as many locations as possible.

(High Tide's strategy is unique because they have been more focused on expanding their DIGITAL footprint, but I've covered the brilliance of that strategy in other posts.)

The reason they are all expanding this quickly is because they are confident the demand will continue we to rise and those assets will be worth far more in the future. Frankly, if they don't expand into X state, their competition will.

*****
&gt; U.S. stocks rallied Friday as Wall Street caps off a strong weekly performance, recovering from a Federal Reserve-induced slump.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 377.19 points, or about 1.19% to 32,151.71. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 1.53% to 4,067.36, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.11% to 12,112.31.
*****
&gt; Shares of DocuSign surged more than 10% after the electronic agreements company reported an earnings beat. The company also issued a third-quarter revenue forecast that was above expectations.
*****
&gt; All three major averages snapped a three-week losing streak. The Dow added 2.66% on the week, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 3.65%. The Nasdaq Composite is 4.14% higher.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been volatile recently as expectations of a 0.75 percentage point rate hike this month grew on Wall Street, after the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said again that he is “strongly committed” to bringing down inflation.
*****
&gt; “The case for the ongoing bear market is that the Fed will continue to tighten monetary policy, withdraw liquidity from the market and cause a tailspin for equities,” said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth U.S. “But this week’s market recovery has shown there is continued resilience in the economy bolstered by favorable economic reports.”
*****
&gt; Still, Donabedian added that he does not think stocks have reached the bottom of the bear market yet.

&gt; “Indeed, the journey to the next bull market will take time, and will be marked by a series of set-backs and recoveries,” he said.

&gt; # The Midterm Election Is Two Months Away. What Investors Need To Know

&gt; First things first, the Carson Investment Research team would like to send our condolences to the Queen’s family, and all of our friends in the UK. We lost a great one yesterday and the world is a better place because of her.

&gt; Midterm elections are right around the corner, as this week marked two months from the always important election. Although this year investors have been more worried about inflation, the war, the economy, and the stock market than the election, one thing that is playing out once again is midterm years tend to be volatile.

&gt; # The Calendar
&gt; As our first chart shows, the average midterm year since 1950 corrected 17.1% on average, the most out of the four-year presidential cycle. That’s the bad news, the good news is stocks gained 32.3% on average a year off those lows and have never been lower. Although we don’t know if June 16 is officially the lows or not, there could be a lot of opportunity for bulls over the coming year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-1-Midterm.png))**

&gt; Here’s another look at the same thing, but breaking it down by each year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-2-Midterm.png))**

&gt; Should we be surprised that stocks have had a tough go so far in 2022? Maybe not, as this next chart shows the worst time for stocks is a midterm year under a new President. With the S&amp;P 500 up only 2.4% on average these years, it helps put the disappointing year so far into perspective. Now check out what happens the following year, which might be something many investors could be smiling about soon enough.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-3-Midterm.png))**

&gt; Here’s one more look at how stocks do based on the calendar. Below we’ve broken returns down by each quarter out of a 4-year presidential cycle. Sure enough, the first three quarters of a midterm year are historically quite weak, some of the worst out of the entire cycle actually. Once again though, we are on the cusp of some of the strongest quarters coming up and investors need to take notice of the positive seasonality right around the corner.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-4-Midterm.png))**

&gt; # What About The Election?
&gt; Historically the party that loses the election is the motivated party and they tend to gain seats in the House and Senate. In fact, since World War I, the winning party lost nearly 30 seats on average at the first midterm election. FDR during the Great Depression and George W. Bush (post-9/11) are the only two instances when the President’s party gained seats in the House.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-5-Midterm.png))**

&gt; Please don’t shoot the messenger here, but President Biden’s approval ratings have been among the worst ever at this point of a new Presidency. In fact, his current Gallup approval rating of 42% extrapolates out to approximately a 40 seat loss in the House for the Democrats.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-6-Midterm.png))**

&gt; What does it mean for investors? Well, Republicans need to win only five seats to regain control of the House, which is quite likely at this point. The Senate is more of a coin toss, but history shows 4 seats have been added by the motivated party since World War II. With the Senate split 50/50 right now, this one is very close to call, but the Republicans could gain one seat and take full control of Congress. As the chart below shows, the very best scenario for stocks is a Democratic President and a Republican controlled Congress. Should the Democrats retain control of the Senate, that scenario of a Democratic President and split Congress is quite strong for stocks as well.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-7-Midterm.png))**

&gt; # Leave On Some Good News
&gt; Odds are investors will start to hear a lot more about the midterm elections over the coming weeks. You might hear that these sectors will do well if so and so wins, or that these sectors will do poorly if this happens. The truth is no one really knows. After President Trump won in 2016 it was widely assumed coal and steel would do great, the opposite happened. Then under President Biden green energy was to do great and dirty crude and coal would struggle, again, the opposite has happened. We aren’t saying you shouldn’t think like this, it just isn’t so clear cut.

&gt; What is clear cut is stocks historically have done quite well the year after the midterms. As you can see in our last chart, the S&amp;P 500 gained a year after the election every single time since World War II, with a very solid 14.1% average gain over that year. Why is this? Likely markets hate uncertainty and there is a lot of that leading up to a midterm election. But once the election is over the uncertainty is likely lifted.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-8-Midterm.png))**

&gt; So there you have it. Midterm elections are very important for a lot of reasons, but the best part for investors is once the election is over, stocks tend to get a nice tailwind. On the Carson Investment Research team we think this could happen once again and is one reason why we remain overweight stocks here.

&gt; # Four Charts On The Worst Month Of The Year

&gt; “October: This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February.” Mark Twain

&gt; Although October is known for some spectacular crashes, it is September that historically has been the worst month of the year for stocks, suggesting Mr. Twain should maybe change his famous stock market quote. In fact, as our first of four charts show, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.5% on average in September, making it the worst month of the year. It’s also been the worst month over the past 10 and 20 years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-1-090722.png))**

&gt; Why is it so weak you ask? The two ideas that make the most sense to me is first, the big boys are back from the Hamptons and begin to sell to square up their books. Secondly, many large hedge funds and institutions end their fiscal years in October and you tend to see some selling ahead of year-end. Of course, I’d like to ask why October isn’t weak if this is the case, but I digress. Whatever the exact reason, we just think it is important for investors to be aware of this potentially tricky month.

&gt; The next chart is something that most investors might not know. Most of the weakness historically takes place later in the month, while the first half is fairly strong.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-2-090722.png))**

&gt; Our next chart (or technically a table, but you know what I mean) is always a popular one, as it shows how each day of the year historically has done. This once again shows later in September is one of the worst times of the year. I’d like to note that my birthday is October 28, which until only recently had been the best day of the year. I’m not sure that’s a coincidence and I look forward to it taking back the number one spot soon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-3-090722.png))**

&gt; Finally, this last chart shows that if stocks are weak heading into September, things can get even worse. As you can see, the average September drops 0.5% on average, but sports a slight gain if it starts the month above the longer-term 200-day moving average. The catch is things get worse when it starts beneath the 200-day moving average or down more than 15% year-to-date. Given 2022 started September down 17% year-to-date and beneath the 200-day moving average, the potential for seasonal weakness is quite high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-4-090722.png))**

&gt; The good news is we do think the lows for the year are likely in, but it won’t be a smooth ride and we’d advise investors to be ready for some bumps over the coming weeks. Please continue to read our blog, as the Carson Investment Team breaks it all down for you.

&gt; # September Quarterly Options Expiration Dangerous, Week After Pitiful

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/53cbf2101439a76ee66194ee453e4cf5/2cf9b63054b755be-40/s500x750/a0e84576942c9514a8d54708039d6aa00ac97478.jpg))**

&gt; Since the S&amp;P index futures began trading on April 21, 1982, stock options, index options as well as index futures all expire at the same time four times each year—known as Triple Witching. Some call it Quadruple Witching or Quad Witch due to single-stock and ETF futures, their impact on the market has thus far been subdued.

&gt; Monday Before September Triple Witching is less bearish with DJIA and S&amp;P flat on average, but NASDAQ is down 14 of last 23 with and average loss of -0.25%. September’s option expiration week is up 57.5% of the time for S&amp;P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 52.5% of the time and 55.0% of the time respectively.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bc285c0f1763215ee591d196eeb4caeb/2cf9b63054b755be-72/s500x750/d45de71dcee7d32f722d27c6f861c643354c13c0.jpg))**

&gt; However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last nineteen years, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September’s option expiration week, up thirteen times, but NASDAQ is down the last four. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&amp;P 500 has been down nine of the last ten since.

&gt; **S&amp;P 500 Down 25 of 32 Week After September Quarterly Options Expiration, Average Loss 0.89%**

&gt; The week after September options expiration week, has a dreadful history of declines most notably since 1990. The week after September quarterly options expiration week has been a nearly constant source of pain with only a few meaningful exceptions over the past 32 years. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just four times: 1998, 2001, 2010 and 2016 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses.

&gt; Full stats are the sea-of-red in the tables here. Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA –0.98%, S&amp;P 500 –0.89%, NASDAQ –0.85%. End-of-Q3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer holdings and position for the fourth quarter.

&gt; # Historic Small Cap Volatility

&gt; It's no secret that growth stocks have underperformed value stocks over the last twelve months. The trailing-twelve-month performance spread (percentage points) between the small-cap growth and large-cap value indices, two opposite ends of the equity market, is currently at -20.5 percentage points. Although this is far above the recent low of -33.9 ppts, the current reading is in the bottom 6% of all days since the mid-1994 (when both the MSCI USA Small Cap Growth and MSCI USA Large Cap Value Index were active). Interestingly, this year's trailing twelve-month performance spread was the lowest since 2001 (unwind of the dot-com bubble). Funny enough, the spread had hit the highest level since early 2000 in 2021, as excessive performance from small-cap growth stocks has tended to reverse course after reaching extreme levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/TTM-Performance-Spread-ppts-090722.png))**

&gt; Small-cap growth stocks tend to trade at significantly higher valuation multiples than large-cap value stocks, which is part of the reason that small-cap growth equities have sold off at a higher rate than their counterparts. These stocks also have higher betas, so market moves have a disproportionate effect. These factors have caused the average daily percent change spread between the two indices to reach an extremely elevated level, the highest since 2000 - 2001. This measure of volatility is also yet to roll over, indicating no end to the volatility regime that has been in place.

Electric car giant Tesla is evaluating the feasibility of a lithium hydroxide refining facility on the gulf coast of Texas.

Tesla said the plant would be focused on the development of “battery-grade lithium hydroxide” and be “the first of its kind in North America,” according to a newly released letter to the Texas Comptroller’s Office.

The company would process “raw ore material into a usable state for battery production” then ship the lithium hydroxide to various Tesla battery manufacturing factories, the application said.

In April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company may need to get into lithium refining because the cost of the metal had “gone to insane levels.”

The price of lithium is up 120% this year, according to an tracking index from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

#[Stock futures rise as Wall Street looks to snap a 3-week losing streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose Friday following a choppy trading session as traders considered Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s latest comments on inflation.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose by 235 points, or 0.74%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.81% and 1.05%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Shares of DocuSign surged more than 17% in extended trading after the electronic agreements company reported an earnings beat. The company also issued a third-quarter revenue forecast that was above expectations.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 193 points, or 0.61%, during the regular session on Thursday — closing higher after alternating between gains and losses throughout the day. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.66%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.60%.
*****
&gt; Those gains put all three major averages on pace to snap a three-week losing streak. Through Thursday, the Dow is up 1.45%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.09%, and the Nasdaq Composite is 1.99% higher.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been volatile recently as expectations of a 0.75 percentage point rate hike this month grew on Wall Street, after the Fed chair said again that he is “strongly committed” to bringing down inflation.
*****
&gt; “I think that people are grossly underestimating what the Fed is going to have to do to fight inflation,” Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein said Thursday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “It’s incredibly ironic that investors are even considering a Fed pivot when the real fed funds rate remains about as most negative as it has historically been. So the Fed isn’t even really heartily fighting inflation yet. We don’t have a positive real fed funds rate. It’s hard to argue that we should turn wildly bullish anytime soon,” he added.

t3_x9307k|1662649903|StockMarket|Beginner resource: What are Free Cash Flows and how to Calculate Them|"Free cash flows represent the generated cash which belongs to owners[1](https://thinkvalue.substack.com/p/what-are-free-cash-flows-and-how#footnote-1) of a company. To calculate it, we need to find the cash from operating activities and subtract capital spending.

We use cash from operating activities because it is after expenses[2](https://thinkvalue.substack.com/p/what-are-free-cash-flows-and-how#footnote-2) have been subtracted from revenues. Then we subtract the capital expenditures because that represents cash leaving the business to fund growth investments - think buying property for a factory or new machinery.

*Note for non-beginners: This article only explains basic FCF, which is a simplification of free cash flows to the firm (FCFF). If you are a beginner, this will be enough to help you understand the concept, but definitely not enough for investing in stocks.*

### Calculation

We can calculate free cash flows as: Cash from operating activities - Capital Expenditures.

FCF = CFO - CapEx

Example of Computing Free Cash Flows from Verizon’s (NYSE:VZ) 2Q 2022 [Statement of Cash Flows](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/732712/000073271222000043/vz-20220630.htm#i00d67274b0cc4403944f38098da35fab_13)

From the above example, we compute FCF as:

$ 17,665  
- $ 10,491  
= $ 7,174

We use free cash flows to understand how much money is left for investors after most obligations have been met. This is similar to the amount of cash people are left with on their bank account after expenses.

### Free Cash Flows vs. Profit

Free cash flows are similar to profit[3](https://thinkvalue.substack.com/p/what-are-free-cash-flows-and-how#footnote-3) but attempt to approximate what a company gets in the bank, rather than what is considered as profit in the accountant’s book.

### Practical Example

In order to understand the difference between profit and FCF just think of what you bring to the bank vs. what you make from assets that are not cash.

The most common non-cash items are D&amp;A (depreciation &amp; amortization) and SBC (stock based compensation).

In calculating profit, you subtract D&amp;A as an expense, but when looking at the cash flows, you add it back because no cash spending[4](https://thinkvalue.substack.com/p/what-are-free-cash-flows-and-how#footnote-4) actually happened.

In the example of SBC, an employer may give workers company stock as part of their compensation. This is recorded as an expense, lowering your net profit. But since stocks are not cash, it gets added back to the cash flows, making them look bigger than profits.

Edspira ([https://youtu.be/TAu8k6a3SPw](https://youtu.be/TAu8k6a3SPw)) has a great video on the differences between net income (profit) and cash from operating activities (What we use before subtracting CapEx).

### Why is Free Cash Flow Important?

FCF is important for investors. It is arguably a better measure of the company’s ability to produce cash. Ideally, profit and FCF should be the same number, but when they are not, lean towards trusting the cash flows.

*Note: Executives have gotten more savvy at presenting the FCF output, and one should trust FCF numbers only if they truly understand them. Unfortunately, this article only explains the basics, which are not what finance professionals should use - ever.*

Do you think he should be held accountable like everyone else?|"After two years of lawsuits, a court finally unsealed key evidence from the FBI’s 2020 investigation of North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr for allegedly trading stocks based on nonpublic information.

Public records at the time show that Burr abruptly liquidated more than half of his and his wife’s equity holdings in February of 2020, when most of the world had yet to focus on the looming coronavirus crisis.

Burr was ultimately not charged with breaking any laws, but the newly released records show FBI agents believed Burr had committed insider trading and securities fraud.

Do you think the texts might be incriminating?|"A judge sharply criticized Elon Musk for not properly turning over text messages that could be evidence in Twitter Inc.’s lawsuit seeking to force the billionaire to complete his proposed $44 billion buyout of the social-media platform.

Delaware Chancery Judge Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick said in a Wednesday ruling there were “glaring deficiencies” in how Musk and his lawyers responded to Twitter’s request for text messages he and top aide Jared Birchall sent and received about the proposed deal and his subsequent effort to withdraw from it. She ordered the men to turn over phone records about their texts.

“Third parties produced text messages with Musk that Musk himself did not produce,” she said. Some of the exchanges he produced also had obvious gaps. Still, she noted Musk’s legal team moved to clear up many of the problems Twitter complained about in pre-trial information exchanges.

Alex Spiro, Musk’s lead lawyer, declined to comment on McCormick’s ruling about the texts. Twitter representatives didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

McCormick noted Musk produced two texts Robert Steel of Perella Weinberg sent him 18 minutes apart on June 17. Steel first asked a question and then subsequently texted, “Ok. Got it…” The second text clearly indicated that Musk replied to the first, the judge said, but the response wasn’t turned over to Twitter.

“Assuming that Musk’s response was not telepathic, one would expect some evidence of it in defendants’ document production,” McCormick wrote. “But defendants provided none by the deadline.”

Analyst Brian Lee upgraded shares of the stock to buy from to sell and stated in a Wednesday note to clients that he believes the company will be a long-term beneficiary of the bill’s solar panel manufacturing credits.

He wrote that FSLR is one of the most levered to US demand tailwinds in our solar panel supplier coverage. The US accounts for approximately 80% of the company’s revenue. The climate bill — formally known as the Inflation Reduction Act — offers rebates and tax credits to consumers for climate-focused products such as electric vehicles and solar panel roof installations, while aiming to incentivize the manufacturing of clean energy products at home .

First Solar last month announced that it would invest up $1 billion to construct a new U.S. solar panel manufacturing plant. Markets have been impressed by the sector since its passage. Goldman’s coverage of solar companies has seen a rise of 30% to 40% in shares, and First Solar is no exception. We are pleased to report that our upgrade was not too early. Lee noted that the stock is up 64% in the six months since IRA legislation was introduced, but that there are still some upsides to what has quickly became a domestic solar manufacturing champ across our coverage.

Lee also anticipates more upside in 2023, 2024, as more people revise their estimates moving forward. First Solar shares have risen nearly 55% in the past year, but could rise another 28% from Wednesday’s closing. This is based on the bank’s $172 price target. Lee upgraded Maxeon Solar Technologies’ status to buy, while downgrading Canadian Solar and Shoals Technologies Group shares.

Hello,

So about two weeks ago, I had made a post where I had compiled the interest rates of various countries and Argentina had topped that list with an interest rate of 60%.

[Link to the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/wz06js/the_central_bank_of_argentinas_interest_rate_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

**What followed were interesting questions, answers, and insights! Especially about Argentina, because a Redditor who was an Argentine and into finance commented and responded to many questions (most were mine as I got really intrigued). Another Redditor who was also an Argentine chipped in, and both these Redditors made the whole post very insightful.**

**Shoutout to** [**u/Drorta**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Drorta/) **and** [**u/JFSM01**](https://www.reddit.com/user/JFSM01/)**. Your insights were awesome!**

**I had originally posted the following questions to these Redditors** \- 

1. What are the rates of interest on personal loans?
2. What are the rates of interest on mortgages?
3. What are the rates of interest on vehicle finance?
4. What rates of interest do you guys actually get when depositing in banks? Or do you guys even deposit in banks, or it just doesn't make sense?
5. Do prices of everyday goods actually change everyday/every week?
6. Do you guys use any other currency or any stable crypto for your transaction that offers more stability?
7. Do you guys use more digital transactions/card transactions rather than cash because it gets burdensome and could be dangerous to walk around with that kind of cash?
8. What in your opinion has led to multiple defaults and such high inflations?
9. Do the youth believe in a better and brighter future? Or do they prefer moving out to another country or another continent?
10. What are your thoughts on inflation, interest rates, and the future of Argentina?

&amp;#x200B;

**A few of their answers collated and not in the order of the questions** \- 

* Rates on term deposits are about 70%. Personal loans are at about 90% and mortgage is at about 120%. Some special purpose business loans are lesser than the inflation rate. The mortgage market isn't that big, because nobody wants to lend out that far in the future, no matter the rate they receive.
* When mortgages are given out, the tenure is usually 5 - 7 years and they are reserved for businesses or high cash flow situations
* People don't usually do term deposits because the money needs to be locked up and people don't want that. Because in the past 3 months, the Peso depreciated against the USD by about 40%, so people find it risky. And also, in the past the Government has just taken their money from their accounts, so no trust.
* Prices of goods actually change everyday and they use stable currencies such as the USD, for storing of value. One of the Redditors has a Construction Materials Business and these are their exact words - "" I have a construction materials retail business. **I change prices every day**. Some of my providers will send weekly price lists, some monthly, some just whenever they feel like it. **Supermarkets like Walmart have employees just for re-labeling prices**.""
* They use a lot of digital and card transactions because otherwise they would need to walk around with a lot of cash. Another quote from the same Redditor who has the Construction Materials Business - "" **Our biggest denomination bill is effectively a 3 dollar bill. So If you want to buy anything relevant with cash, you have to carry loads of it. Like I said I own a retail business, I have an employee that carries backpacks full of cash to the bank daily**.""
* The youth are moving out of the country to work somewhere else (especially the educated ones). And many try to get a job with remote working benefits and that pays in USD. So they earn in USD but spend in Pesos and as the value of the Peso drops, they basically just make a higher wage because their money is in USD.

**Then these were some follow up questions to their responses** \- 

1. So do people even borrow at those rates? Because one has to literally pay back twice the amount in like 14 months. I understand the whole point of such high rates is to curb lending, but the ones who borrow (retail or commercial) might be having some crazy amount of earning power in a year because they need to basically earn twice and pay back and even have a profit (in the case of a business)
2. If mortgages are so high, I believe mortgages might not be a thing in Argentina, right? So everyone buys in cash? And how dead is the real estate industry? Because if with these rates it is thriving then it’s crazy and I would definitely look into and probably even come up with some investment thesis.
3. So do people deposit with banks or just let it be?
4. What apps or services are the most famous out there? Like is it MasterCard/Visa or some other big name brand or some other brand which is more local or Lat-Am based?
5. But the ones that are moving out, are they sending money back to their families or sending money back to the family isn’t in the culture? And also, the ones that move out, do they buy real estate in their home country?

**To which their responses were** \- 

* People still borrow at those rates because they exchange the Pesos to USD in the black market and then wait a few months for the Peso to depreciate and then convert back again and pay the loan. In the process they make a nice gain. So people borrow to speculate on the currency and not for spending or investments.
* **The Redditor with the Construction Materials Business quotes - "" Retail or Commercial will not have that hard a time repaying, considering their own prices rise all the time. My own business is selling with 84% growth YoY, but at least 60% of that is inflation. "" (*****My personal key takeaway here - we all have read about how businesses with pricing power do well during times of inflation compared to other industries or compared to other companies in the same industry who do not have pricing power. This here is proof!*****)**
* Quote from the Redditor with the Construction Materials Business on my question regarding Real Estate - "" Most real estate deals are done in cash and in USD. The real estate market is my field of expertise. It's a lot slower for sure. However, keep in mind the following: the peso devalues fast. US dollar bills can be bought as a reserve of value, but due to a number of regulations, it has to be bought under the table. **If you have a cash generating business, where do you go to store your value? bingo, to real estate. A LOT of the movement in real estate isn't people buying their homes. It's just people's way of saving money. It's a somewhat solid store of value**.""
* People don't deposit in banks but rather spend or invest it or buy USD. Nobody holds Pesos, as it burns in their hands.
*  Mercado Libre is the leader in payment apps
* Quote from the other Redditor on my question regarding sending money back to family - "" Yes, they do but its really fucked up because the gov automatically liquidates the dollars on arrival and sends pesos.""

**More follow up questions to the responses above** \- 

1. Wow! You know for this to be right and be profitable, the Peso should depreciate against the USD more than the interest rate in a year? But I believe that already happens and hence people are doing this. But tbh, the more people do this, the more the peso gets weaker, because all they are really doing is betting against the Peso.
2. That’s a very risky thing to do honestly. Because in the very unlikely case that the peso gets stronger against the USD, people will get burnt. And they probably might rush to convert back, making the peso even more stronger. It’s actually a double edged sword and works both ways.
3. So if the govt. is doing this, aren’t the people not sending through normal channels and possibly sending only USD on Mercado Pago?

**To which their responses were** \- 

* The government would just print more Pesos in the unlikely scenario that the Peso starts getting stronger than the USD. And the people are sure that they won't get burnt because historically the Peso has only depreciated against the USD.
* Quote from the Redditor with the Construction Materials Business on my question regarding transacting money on apps and other digital transactions - "" This is a more complicated scenario. Crypto is being used a lot to move money in USD in and out of Argentina. Also platforms like PayPal, Payoneer, Wise, etc. **On the other hand, if you have money outside the US, and need pesos here, why bring the money? just ""sell"" your money outside, to someone that wants it outside. Anyone generating money here is looking to move it abroad. So they pay with pesos to anyone that has dollars abroad in any platform, effectively never letting those dollars enter the Argentinean economy.**""

&amp;#x200B;

And one of my last questions (kept it for the last because the response blew my mind as it was something unexpected and something I never ever thought of) was - 

 1. So then only real estate becomes the option of an inflation hedge? 

To which the response by the Redditor with the Construction Materials Business was - 

"" yes, pretty much. Different people use different things as a value reserve, with different benefits. I was just a kid when we had hyper inflation, were talking 100% per month. **My dad bought used cars as a reserve, and sold them when he need money. Not a great here but pretty liquid**.""

&amp;#x200B;

**This is just so enterprising. Necessity is definitely the mother of innovation!**

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/wz06js/comment/ilzy9rg/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) if someone is interested in reading the whole thread verbatim.

If we ever have high inflation (hopefully not as high as Argentina) then some of the points mentioned above can be used in our context. Our context being the country we live in and our financial situation. I personally would trade second hand cars, because where I live, cars are a big thing.

Anyway, hope you had a good read, Cheers! :)"|0.75|4|0|4

Today, they just bought $60 Million Dollars worth of $KO Coca-Cola 1 million shares. Smart money &amp; Hedge Funds are ready for recession and preparing for the next few weeks by buying dividend king stocks.

Watch the daily volume traded per day. Unusually high volume historically every time $KO Coca-Cola stock hits bottom before going parabolic the next days. It means the institutions bought the dip, and they are ready to let the Coca-Cola stock start running up again."|0.29|0|0|0

Small cap GWSO. Specializing in technologies against global warming, I think this company can run off the narrative. We hear about environmental concerns and global warming like it’s a broken record. 

Anyways, currently stock is consolidating nicely at around $7. Right before their major event coming in about a week. Theyre announcing their EV sodium battery. I think with such big news ahead (their biggest catalyst) the stock will pump leading into the event. My guess is the want to get the stock to about $10 before the news and attention they’ll get once the battery comes out. 

Price is at range lows currently. Just a week or two away before their biggest catalyst as an otc company. Short interest building but they’ve been squeezing them. I’m expecting more news and hype to start flowing in and pushing this company upwards of $10-11"|0.25|0|0|0

Days later, the market crashed.|"After two years of lawsuits, a court finally unsealed key evidence from the FBI’s 2020 investigation of North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr for allegedly trading stocks based on nonpublic information.

Public records at the time show that Burr abruptly liquidated more than half of his and his wife’s equity holdings in February of 2020, when most of the world had yet to focus on the looming coronavirus crisis.

Burr was ultimately not charged with breaking any laws, but the newly released records show FBI agents believed Burr had committed insider trading and securities fraud.

The most compelling new evidence is the flurry of calls and texts between Burr, his wife Brooke Burr, her brother Gerald Fauth and Fauth’s wife that took place on the same days that both the Fauths and the Burrs sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock right before the market plunged.

t3_x86kia|1662560874|StockMarket|Judge denies Elon Musk’s attempt to delay Twitter trial|"A Delaware court has denied billionaire Elon Musk’s attempt to push back the October trial over his abortive Twitter acquisition, but it agrees that he can incorporate claims made by former Twitter security chief Peiter “Mudge” Zatko into his case.

The decision follows a hearing yesterday afternoon that saw Musk’s attorneys argue for a “meager” few weeks to review new information before the trial’s October 17th start date. Twitter, meanwhile, accused Musk of trying to drag out the trial and “sow chaos” with more document requests — claiming at one point that its lawyers had been forced to pause responding to international law enforcement requests.

Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick said that Musk should be granted wide latitude to amend claims before the trial starts, overruling Twitter’s objections, although she said she was “reticent to say more concerning the merits of the counterclaims” before the litigation. Musk and Twitter will negotiate on “limited” discovery of new documents related to Zatko’s allegations, which include a variety of claims about poor management at Twitter as well as assertions that executives lied about the number of bots on the platform.

“THE COMPANY HAS BEEN FORCED FOR MONTHS TO MANAGE UNDER THE CONSTRAINS OF A REPUDIATED MERGER AGREEMENT”

However, McCormick said that Twitter would be unduly harmed by a delay in the trial — which Musk had initially pushed to schedule next year. “The company has been forced for months to manage under the constrains of a repudiated merger agreement,” wrote McCormick. “I am convinced that even four weeks’ delay would risk further harm to Twitter too great to justify.”

The ruling is consistent with McCormick’s earlier push for a fast trial, but the decision to allow the whistleblower’s claims strengthens Musk’s case — albeit in ways that aren’t necessarily fatal to Twitter. Musk initially said he suspended the deal because he’d discovered a far larger number of bots on the platform than he expected, but at the trial, he’s likely to argue that Twitter concealed “material adverse effects” potentially beyond the scope of bots, thanks to Zatko’s disclosures.

Meanwhile, Twitter has subpoenaed a wide range of Musk allies and argued that Musk got cold feet that have nothing to do with bots. At the hearing, it pointed to a text message urging his banker to “slow down” the deal for a few days while evaluating a speech by Russian President Vladimir Putin. “It won’t make sense to buy Twitter if we’re heading into World War 3,” Musk said. The two sides will likely continue arguing over exactly what information they’ll need to hand over — but thanks to today’s decision, we won’t be waiting long to see it.

[https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23339673/musk-twitter-trial-delay-request-denied-whistleblower-claims-granted](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23339673/musk-twitter-trial-delay-request-denied-whistleblower-claims-granted)

Elon Musk’s request to delay the trial over his Twitter (TWTR) acquisition deal has been denied by the Delaware court. The TWTR vs. Musk 5-day trial is slated on October 17. Do you think Musk will be eventually forced to buy TWTR at $44 billion?"|0.94|77|0|77

High season (September/October till February/March) in the uranium sector is about to start.

And in the meantime an additional global uranium deficit of \~50,000,000lb uranium is being created as we speak.

While the global primary uranium supply in 2022 is around 135,000,000lb --&gt; 50/135 = that additional annual supply deficit is 37% of the  global uranium production in 2022! And there was already a supply  deficit before those 50Mlbs/y.

Due to deteriorating relations between the Western world and Russia, the nuclear fuel supply insecurity for western utilities is increasing very  fast!

This leads to an important shift from underfeeding (annual \~20 Mlbs secondary supply) to  overfeeding (annual \~30 Mlbs secondary DEMAND).

==&gt; So an add ANNUAL uranium supply gap of 50 Mlb due to switch from  underfeeding to overfeeding added to the already existing global supply deficit before that shift, but don’t worry in 2023 [$UUUU](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24UUUU&amp;src=cashtag_click) could produce \~120,000lb, [$URG](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24URG&amp;src=cashtag_click) \~800,000lb, [$EU](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24EU&amp;src=cashtag_click) \~1200,000lb, [$UEC](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24UEC&amp;src=cashtag_click) 200,000lb(licensed for 6.5Mlb/y), [$PDN](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24PDN&amp;src=cashtag_click) 3200,000lb (ramp up phase), [$BOE](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24BOE&amp;src=cashtag_click)  225,000lb, ... (my own estimates based on the analysis of each existing uranium projects and uranium mines in USA and abroad, and backed by  simulations of others)

**In other words, there will not be enough additional uranium production ready ON TIME in 2023/2024 to close that supply gap.**

For more information on this shift from underfeeding to overfeeding:

&amp;#x200B;

Important here also is:

1. the  fact that the demand for uranium is price INelastic. An uranium price  of 50 USD/lb or an uranium price of 100 USD/lb will NOT change the  demand for uranium.
2. recessions don't reduce uranium consumption.

Oil demand could be impacted (probably will be) due to a world recession  (I'm not talking about the supply side of Oil), but uranium demand NOT.  Reactors don’t consume less uranium in a recession. NO, nuclear reactors  consume the same amount during recessions, because nuclear power is  baseload power!

&amp;#x200B;

**By consequence the uranium price will most probably increase significantly in the coming months and in 2023/2024.**

Today the uranium spotprice is at \~51USD/lb, while US miners need a sell  price well above 60USD/lb and Cameco said in May: ”to restart our US  assets we need at least 80USD/lb”

t3_x849wd|1662554912|StockMarket|Is PSNY a good buy here?|"Polestar is an electric vehicle manufacturer out of Sweden that is focused on high performance sports cars.  In the recent filings, the company announced that they have recorded $1.04 Billion in sales for the previous three months.  They also posted a loss of for more than $500 Million over the same period of time.  In the filing, the Chairman announced that they plan on construction a manufacturing plant here in the United States.   Polestar is completely new car company, serving as Volvo's performance and electric-vehicle brand.  It's goal is to blend high-tech offerings with modern Swedish styling. The Polestar 2 is the brand's answer to the Tesla Model 3.  The lineup will also add an all-electric crossover in the form of the Polestar 3 as well as a four-door hatchback in the style of a sedan that's called the Polestar 5.  The Polestar 2 sells for just under $50,000.

Polestar, which went public in June, said revenue surged 95% to $1.04 billion on higher vehicle shipments. Still, the manufacturer’s operating loss more than doubled in the period due to the expense of its rapid expansion and a one-time share-based listing charge related to its merger with a blank-check company.   The company delivered 21,185 cars in the first half, compared to 9,510 in the year-earlier period. The company is targeting around 290,000 EV sales by 2025. In October, it will enter the sport-utility vehicle segment with the launch of the Polestar 3.

The Polestar 6 comes packing some impressive electric muscle beneath its sporty metal skin. The powertrain features an 800-volt architecture with dual motors creating 884hp and 663 lb/ft of torque. Polestar says car will reach 0-60 mph in 3.2 seconds.

At the moment, there are no electric two-door coupes on the market that don’t cost hundreds of thousands (or millions) of dollars, and no electric convertibles at all. In what could be a coup for Polestar, it may have the only electric roadster on the market when the Polestar 6 comes out in 2026.  Polestar optimization leads to faster acceleration, faster gear changing, better control, improved reliability, and better engine response. 

“With the overwhelming consumer and press response, we took the decision to put this stunning roadster into production and I am so excited to make it a reality,” says Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar CEO. “Polestar 6 is a perfect combination of powerful electric performance and the thrill of fresh air with the top down.”

Revealed in Los Angeles in March as the Polestar O, the electric roadster concept builds on the design, technology and sustainability ambitions laid out by the Polestar Precept and showcases the brand’s vision for future sports cars.  The hard-top convertible will be built on Polestar’s bespoke bonded aluminum platform. Developed in-house, it will feature the high-performance, 800-Volt electric architecture already confirmed for Polestar 5. This includes output of up to 884 hp (650kW) and 663 lb-ft (900 Nm) from a dual motor powertrain, a targeted 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) sprint time of 3.2 seconds and a top speed of 155 mph (250 km/h).

Polestar, which will invest in the battery cell manufacturer  StoreDot, is preparing to incorporate using StoreDot's extreme fast-charging silicon-dominant batteries in future Polestar cars. StoreDot says it's on track to begin mass producing its “100 in 5” technology as early as 2024, achieving 100 miles of range in just five minutes of charging.   Currently in the United States, if electricity costs ¢10.7 per kWh and the electric vehicle consumes 27 kWh to travel 100 miles, the cost per mile is about $0.03. If electricity costs ¢10.7 per kilowatt-hour, charging an EV with a 200-mile range (assuming a fully depleted 54 kWh battery that is being used in the Polestar 2) will cost about $6 to reach a full charge. 

 Polestar is a Swedish automotive brand established in 1996 by  Volvo partner Flash/Polestar Racing and acquired in 2015 by Volvo, which itself was acquired by Geely in 2010. The company is headquartered in Torslanda, Sweden with vehicle production taking place in China.   Volvo Car owns about 48% of Polestar and is an intrical factor in the car company going forward.

The Polestar name originates from the STCC Polestar Racing Team which spawned Polestar Performance AB, in turn acquired by Volvo Cars in July 2015. The racing team changed its name to Cyan Racing while maintaining close ties to Volvo.

In September 2021, Polestar announced an intention to go public through a business combination agreement with Gores LLC, a US special purpose acquisition company. Polestar shares began trading on the  Nasdaq exchange under the symbol PSNY on 24 June 2022.  There are 466 million shares issued and outstanding with roughly 8 million shares being shorted, less than 2%, with a market cap of approximately $3.2 Billion"|0.63|3|0|3

*****

# [Stock futures are flat, weighed down by fears the Fed will keep raising rates aggressively](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Wednesday as investors worry that the Federal Reserve will hand out another large rate hike in September in a bid to tame high inflation.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 86 points, giving up earlier gains. S&amp;P 500 futures also retreated, edging lower by 0.30%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.27%. If the slide continues into the trading day, it could be the eighth negative session in a row for the Nasdaq Composite.
*****
&gt; Stock futures dipped into negative territory after a Wall Street Journal article suggested that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s commitment to reduce inflation could mean that the central bank hikes rates by 0.75 percentage point in September, which would be the third consecutive increase of that size. Markets have been hoping that the Fed would start to hand out smaller increases starting in September, but are now pricing in an 86% chance of a 0.75 percentage point hike.
*****
&gt; Stocks added to their three-week slide Tuesday. The Dow fell about 173 points, or 0.5%, and the S&amp;P 500 slid 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% to notch its first seven-day losing streak since 2016.
*****
&gt; The moves came amid a surge in bond yields that saw the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield jump to its highest level since June. The rate on the 30-year Treasury closed at its highest level since 2014. Bond yields move inversely to prices. Rates dipped slightly Wednesday, with the 10-year trading at 3.321%. The 2-year and 30-year yields traded at 3.47% and 3.472%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Investors are split on how to approach the market entering the first post-Labor Day week in September, a notoriously cruel month for stocks. All eyes are on the 3,900 level on the S&amp;P 500. Some see the index falling to even lower lows, while others are optimistic about a year-end rally.
*****
&gt; “With equities back to June lows and the rates path reset higher, more inflation easing along with decisive EU government intervention to tackle the energy crisis could prompt another bear squeeze,” Emmanuel Cau of Barclays wrote in a Wednesday note. “Big picture, we think stocks remain in a tough spot given a poor growth-policy trade-off.”
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will give its summary on current economic conditions, also known as the Beige Book. Elsewhere, Fed presidents Loretta Mester of Cleveland and Tom Barkin of Richmond, as well as Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard are scheduled to speak at various events.

And when money is flowing out of a sector, you might see pops get successfully shorted and bearish trends establish themselves.

We use the Growth 250 list created by Investor's Business Daily (of which we am unaffiliated) to understand the depth and breadth of the market any given week. And we keep a running study of this list, tracking money flows between subsectors.

# So Where is Smart Money Going Right Now?

**TL;DR... This week:**

*Long Side*

1. *Aerospace/Defense:* NOC LMT
2. *Energy-Solar:* ENPH FSLR ARRY
3. *Food-Packaged:* CPB CAG GIS TWNK SJM
4. *Insurance-Various:* WRB ACGL PGR
5. *Medical-Biomed/Biotech:* VRTX APLS CPRX

*Short Side*

1. Semiconductor Equipment: TER ASML
2. Freight Transportation: YELL ODFL ZIM CP XPO

# Our Findings:

A lot of changes from the last week when the Fed looks to be getting ready for another big rate hike. On the long side, there we see some rotation into defense-type plays. Sectors to watch: *Aerospace/Defense,* *Energy-Solar,* *Food-Packaged,* *Insurance* and *Medical-Biomed/Biotech.* To the short side, we are looking at a pause for *Oil &amp; Gas* with more damage coming to sub groups that service semiconductor manufacturing, in addition to lower freight demand signaling investors to sell *Transportation.*

***The Long Side***

1. ***Aerospace/Defense:*** With more and more weapons flowing from American companies to the war in Ukraine, the Department of Defense is going to make it even easier for US Defense companies to sell their products to other countries in need as well. Most of the names in the sector trade on lighter volume so the best companies are very hard to trade. A few tickers to follow with enough liquidity include the usual players NOC LMT
2. ***Energy-Solar:*** With these names holding big moves they made a month ago, they seem to be setting up again with a good amount of inflow this past week. ENPH is the sector leader but FSLR ARRY are both expecting some crazy growth in the coming quarters.
3. ***Food-Packaged:*** Here we have a nice defense sector that is showing some strength with a large amount of names getting inflow. These are not huge movers but great defense plays for a potentially choppy week coming in. We like CPB CAG GIS TWNK SJM for their fundamentals and will be watching them all week.
4. ***Insurance - Various:*** When insurance companies are allowed to invest the premiums they hold into bonds, they benefit from rising yields like we are seeing right now. This is why these are seeing an uptick. Some solid names to watch include WRB ACGL PGR
5. ***Medical-Biomed/Biotech:*** We are seeing more flows into ‘defense-growth’ healthcare plays as well — which has been a theme off and on for some time this year. The key is they get their revenue from governments and large corporations which are dependable and consistent regardless of economic conditions. We like VRTX APLS CPRX

***The Short Side***

1. ***Semiconductor Equipment:*** These are a lot of companies that supply equipment and supplies for semiconductor manufacturing. This selling represents the damage that is suffered upstream as the entire semiconductor sector struggles and this is now flattening out to the outlier players like these. Some potential shorts right now are: TER ASML
2. ***Freight Transportation - Various:*** We are seeing lowering demand for freight transport and projecting even lower traffic for next year. A few names to watch for weakness: YELL ODFL ZIM CP XPO

# Review: Last Week

Last week we looked for longs in *Chemicals-Agricultural* *Oil &amp; Gas* and *Utilities.*

Ag chemicals continued to consolidate, shaking out weak holders and creating a nice handle. *Oil &amp; Gas* was a bit stronger but also remained inside last week’s high and continues to consolidate. The strongest names made modest gains on the week.

The market agreed much more with our predictions on the short side. *Computer software* was an easy target as growth companies are getting slapped by more hawkish posturing by The Fed. We targeted a few companies that are overvalued with highly specialized and under-diversified product or service — the **DDOG short idea finished -9% on the week with OKTA closing -30%.**

# Why Look at Market Rotation?

Day traders can use subsector momentum studies like this one to identify momentum stocks and develop greater conviction in a predicted move.

Keeping an eye on this flow has proven to be a *huge boon* to our edge. We have found that when we trade in subsectors that are having changes in money flow that there is an increased level of continuation that correlates to the flow, whether positive or negative. And to put it simply, this translates into bigger moves with reduced chop.

Momentum studies like these can help make trading simpler. Even so, we believe in the trading community and that's why we share our research. As always, drop your thoughts and questions in the comments.

The costs of extraction havn't changed.  Foreign supplies have been curtailed.  Local supplies remain the same.  But due to the supply/demand curve changing (supply is reduced, demand has stayed the same), provider's up the price.  Whether this is an inclination of corporate doing, or if it is a side-effect of futures/derivatives/energy-exchanges, I'm not sure.

The money of the higher prices paid has to go somewhere.  And, if I understand correctly, is simply a 'profit' for no increase in generation. Unless, of course, those extra funds are actually being applied to building new infrastructure.

**KEY FACTS**

* Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC)—the Nasdaq-listed blank check company which has agreed to acquire Truth Social’s parent company Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG) and take it public—failed to garner the requisite 65% votes needed to extend the completion of the deal by an additional year, Reuters reported, citing “people familiar with the matter.”
* The company recently claimed the voting process has been challenging because most of its shareholders are individuals and their votes need to be secured through their brokers.
* The company has sought until September 8, 2023 to complete the deal, an extension beyond the customary two-year deadline—which expires on Thursday—during which a SPAC is required to complete an acquisition.
* The final vote tally will be announced Tuesday, but Reuters reports that the company’s executives are already exploring alternatives—which include a unilateral six-month extension without shareholder approval—as they believe they will meet the 65% threshold.
* If DWAC fails to deal with the issue before Thursday’s September 8 deadline, it will be forced to liquidate its shares and return the money it raised in its initial public offering.

...Near/Medium term play for reversal/ momentum rebound to current Analyst Targets.
... Long Term Hold (price/Market Cap upside) &amp; Low Share Cost basis locked in for future dividend.
.... For more risk/reward, option are extremely cheap (due to being a reversal rebound scenario)


Definitely take a look at $IHS Towers (below is some background info). Likely hit a bottom Friday (or certainly close enough to jump in and avoid chasing it on a sharp upswing reversal... considering IHS is now right at book value. There has also been a increase in Institutional buyers adding to their positions the past couple of weeks.

Insider Ownership is 32%
Institutional ownership is 55%
Current Ave DV is less than 200,000
**A move to even a remotely typical Average Daily Volume for a $2B company ($500K+), should quickly return Shares to IPO Price $18+ 

There are almost too many positive angles to discuss- but here is an attempt at a full look at the high points.


**Background**
$IHS is the Fastest Growing Cell Tower company. IHS is currently priced at $6.50. It has 7 analyst ratings (all Buys) and an average price target of $18 (most recent price target, issued 2 weeks ago, was Cowen's PT increase to $27).

Current P/S ratio is 1.2  (Price/Book ratio is also 1.2).  Market cap is $2B (an accurate current MC is a minimum of $6-$8B). Last Twelve Months revenue is just under $2Billion &amp; LTM EBITD is right at $1Billion.

IHS is the leading International wireless communications provider in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.

Overall, IHS has 39,000 towers in its property portfolio, across 11 countries (Brazil... south America's largest Country &amp; Nigeria... Africa's largest country, account for the majority of its towers).


**Insanely Undervalued (the reason IHS is highly likely to make quick moves to Analyst 3x and 4x Price Targets)**

Int'l Cell Tower Leaders:
$AMT :  $122B ...195K Towers
$CCI :   $75B ...40K Towers
$SBAC : $36B ...33K Towers

$IHS :   $2B ...39K Towers

IHS went public the end of 2021. The combination being unknown due to operations outside the US, along with the sell off the first half of the year, lead to IHS drifting down about 50% from the $18 IPO area. Then as the market rebounded the past couple of months, a HF/s has been able to manipulate price down even more - due to extremely low trading volume (150,000 average daily volume). 

IHS has an experienced, solid management Team and Board of Director.  2 notable US Board members are... 1) Ursula Barns (Former CEO of Xerox, and  Board member Exxon and Uber. Also- President Obama appointed Burns to lead the White House national program on Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) from 2009 - 2016 and she served as Chair of the President’s Export Council from 2015 - 2016.... and 2) Jeb Bush. (these members also indicate IHS is likely also interested in US assets).

... IHS is under the radar, but is starting to create a buzz.  A relatively small increase in Average Daily Volume- with send the stock moving quickly to Analysts Price Targets.


**1 Good Reason to get in now ..&amp; hold even after a run to current Price Targets**

Aside from the Huge Future upside as its Market Cap moves to catch up with other Tower Co's MC.... is the chance to lock in the low entry point, to capitalize on the Divided that will eventually come. 

 IHS is still in its initial growth stage &amp; is therefore using earning to reinvent and acquire Additional Tower assets- (A very smart strategy...for example, IHS is now the leading Power in South Africa following its recent Acquisition of MTN which added 5,700 Towers to its total &amp; 12,000 sites it will Provide PAAS (Power as a Service). The Deal cost $400M (which makes q2 GAAP earnings look artificially low) but the real effect, in the first year alone it provides revenue of $200M and EBITDA of $80M. 

But as revenues start to compound in the next couple if years- Due to Tower Co's tax structure, it will begin to pay a dividend. And if Using IHS as a long term hold strategy-  the eventual dividend could very likely be over 50% per share (based on current cost basis)

$NU is a Brazilian Fintech that went Public the end of last year- and its share price fell in tandem with the overall market the first half of 2022.  Also, due to the general malaise the down market created &amp; its operations being exclusively outside the US... NuBank has been off the radar of most retail investors and is just starting to gain visibility. 

(Institutional investors include Warren Buffett, Cathy Wood, and Tencent who bought at IPO around $10 ...(Double the current $5 price). Masa Son recently jumped on board as well. (Institutional Ownership is listed on Yahoo as  68% of the Float).


**Why Now is the time to Jump In?**

Shares have been steadily coiling the past Coiling/ Accumulating the past 3 months, since Bottoming at the start of Summer (originally moving up along with the overall market- and continue to hold strong the past several weeks as the market has dipped). And Friday- NU entered a breakout zone (see chart).

So- $NU is very likely to start a strong move back to $10 IPO price (or higher).  Even if this ends up taking a few more weeks, it is unlikely to move much lower... and will likely make a quick jump when it does break out in ernest- which buy will miss if they have to chase it. 

(Also- just as a potential side bonus..although not the reason Nu is such a strong buy currently...Nu may also get a small squeeze effect from the 100M short positions at the begging of the breakout (hard to tell... but consider: $Float is 2.2B shares... 77% of which is owned by Institutional Investors ($68%) &amp; Insiders (9%). Additionally-  there were 7.5M Fails to Delivery mid August (last reported period) &amp; daily short volume ratio has been close to 60% in the two weeks since the last 8/15 short report (Total traded volume those two weeks was close to 500M).


**NuBank- Brief Business Overview**

NuBank got its start when its Founder moved by to Brazil, went to open a bank account, and saw how Byzantine the process was.

Nu started by offering a digital solution that made it easier for customers to bank in Brazil - by offering lower cost products and services than the large traditional Brazilian banks. 

*****But the Explosion for Nubank really ignited thanks to 1) the Central Bank establishing the PIX system for citizens to receive their benefits (sort of like Venmo)... 2) then the pandemic, which closed most traditional banks, thus leaving citizens with access to PIX.  (NuBank stepped in to provide a digital solution that could access PIX)....


**Financial Results**

...As a result, Nu has provided millions of customers with their first-ever credit cards and bank accounts. Now the digital bank is spreading like wildfire in Brazil and starting to expand throughout Latin America, a region that many consider to be one of the next big banking markets, with more than 666 million people.

As of 2nd quarter, Nu now has more than 65 million customers (roughly 36% of the Brazilian adult population). Roughly 55% of these active customers are using Nu's Digital Bank as their primary bank.
Most impressive is that a lot of this growth is organic, which has given Nu an industry-low customer acquisition cost around $5 per customer (which is virtually unheard of). Also Nu's servicing cost per customer is 85% lower than traditional banks.

Nu has also successfully starting to grow in other parts of Latin America and is now the No. 1 new issuer of credit cards in Mexico and Colombia.

(***I will post a good overview article of PIX/ Pandemic/ Nubank scenario .. in comments)

These CEOs and BODs of every publicly listed company have been scrambling. Some are going bankrupt because they were corrupt from the get-go. Others are seeing angel investors abandoning ship...or CFOs jumping out of buildings. Still others are showing panic...just look closer at their faces (Zuckerberg, Musk). Even CRAMER looks like he's shitting his pants!

The 15% tax rate for all corporations is no joke. There will be absolutely zero loopholes. They can hire the best tax lawyers, but for whatever break they feel they got somehow, there will be an immediate inclusion of the balance due on their returns. Bottom line for corporations: No way out of paying 15% taxes.

I feel we all have to step back and figure out which businesses will actually make money. We have to look at necessities for average everyday people. Food and drugs, gas and transportation, energy and materials.

t3_x6lz8a|1662398937|StockMarket|Meta has been fined $402 million by the Irish Data Protection Commission for its handling of children’s privacy settings on Instagram|"A fat fine — of $402 million — is headed Instagram’s way after European Union privacy regulators came to a decision on a long running complaint related to how the social media platform handles children’s data. The penalty is for a breach of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Meta was contacted for comment on the penalty.

We understand the final GDPR decision on the Instagram enquiry was sent to Meta, Instagram’s parent, Friday — ahead of formal publication on the websites of the company’s lead data supervisor in the EU, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC); and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), a steering body which helped coordinate a decision review process involving other interested EU data protection authorities — however the size of the penalty for Meta appears to have leaked early, via a report in Politico, which contains the fine figure (which shakes out to around $403M at current currency exchange prices) but no further details of the decision.

Ireland’s DPC confirmed the level of fine to us. Deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told TechCrunch: “We adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of €405 million. Full details of the decision will publish next week.”

The Instagram penalty is the largest GDPR penalty the social media giant has been hit with to-date (though not the largest ever GDPR fine; that one landed on Amazon) — following a $267M penalty levied upon the Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp last September for violations of the GDPR’s transparency principle.

The Instagram complaint focused on the platform’s processing of children’s data for business accounts and on a user registration system it operated which the DPC found could lead to the accounts of child users being set to “public” by default, unless the user changed the account settings to set it to “private”.

The GDPR contains strong measures requiring privacy by design and default generally — as well provisions aimed at enhancing the protection of children’s information specifically, as well as ensuring that services targeting kids are living up to transparency and accountability principles (such as by providing suitably clear communications that children can understand).

The reasoning underpinning the fine for Instagram is expected to be released in the coming days, when the final decision gets published next week (assuming it doesn’t leak early).

While today’s headlines are going to make painful reading for Meta, TikTok is another social media firm likely to be watching developments closely since it’s under investigation by the DPC over its own handling of children’s data. But that enquiry was only opened by the DPC a year ago so it’s likely to have some time to run before a decision is reached.

The Instagram decision took extra time as other DPAs raised objections to Ireland’s draft decision — triggering a mechanism in the regulation designed to settle disputes which can add many more months to the timeframe.

Ireland’s WhatsApp decision also went through a review process after objections were raised to its draft — and in that case the size of the penalty was substantially raised as a result. But it remains to be seen whether the same has happened here, with Instagram.

Nvidia is the 27th largest holding in the firm’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF ARKK with a weight of 0.94%, according to data on the firm’s website.

Interestingly, Wood had sold over 293,000 shares of the chip maker last week, via two of the firm’s exchange-traded funds, valued at over $50 million ahead of the company’s earnings release.

Nvidia reported in a securities filing on Wednesday that the Biden administration has placed restrictions preventing it from selling its A100 and H100 chips to Russia and China.

**One**. Data Fobi Exchange is alive and well and continues to be a future MAJOR rev producer.

**Two**. After talking about the update in insurance he has once again mentioned banks and financial institutions.I suspect one of those is one of the “trophy” deals he is working on.

**Three**. Love how he says that the pipeline is full but no need to be selective who they take on anymore because it’s “all about automation” and they can now load up someone same day. Why turn anyone away when you can be taking their money within the day and the automation keeps churning it in.

**Four**. The burn rate has been reduced by OVER 50%.

**Five**.We appear to be largely complete in terms of defining the company. This includes real time digital wallet AI tech that is used in venue management, coupons, loyalty programs and anything that uses a digital pass (pretty much everything). Leveraging all of this will be the sale of the data that they all produce. So with this the focus has shifted away from developing their tech and stacks to selling it

**Six**. They continue to overcome customer resistance by managing the programs for them. This is KEY. Many customers don’t have a tech department to handle the integration of their tech. No problem. We’ll do it all for you at a ridiculous margin.

**Seven**. Their partners are bearing fruit. Telus, Janam, Barnett, Yotpo are kicking ass.

**Eight**. Big pilots underway for 8112 with the launch in September/October. This is gonna be absolutely YUGE for Fobi not just in the delivery, but by introducing other verticals with it and then throwing in their real time data analytics and of course the selling of that data.

**Nine**. With the burn rate seriously reduced and the obvious pick up in revs, we are getting closer to profitability or at the very least cash flow positive. We can debate until we are blue in the face how big Fobi is going to become. To be totally frank with you I have no idea. Everything screams HUGE company but one truly never knows. But this I do know. Fobi IS going to be very successful. I back this up based on two principles. Their tech is fully automated. In essence it is like software. Download it and it's done. BUT it's software that keeps on giving...download it, pay a set up fee, pay a user fee, and down the road, pay us for your data. It has margins like software but the added benefit of the data which makes it obscene. Secondly, their technology is at the forefront of where the world it going...digitization. So you don't have to worry about Fobi getting passed by as the industry changes. Wallet passes and digitization will be with us for decades. There are no concerns that next year Fobi will become obsolete like those companies dealing with the pandemic. The turning point is upon us and the road is clear for ... well... a very long timeI am very bullish on this company and on its technology that knows no limits, it can be adopted in every vertical and sector with ease and speed. I trust that in a few years the name Fobi will be very well known. Do your dd guys and you'll discover a rough diamond mine in Fobi!

&amp;#x200B;

McDonalds, burger King and many other brands could use Qples by fobi coupons to increase customer loyalty, Roi and better Given the high inflation that has led to the reduction in consumer purchasing power, CPGs are looking for new ways to attract customers. I think the arrival of digital coupons and the transition to 8112 has been accelerated by this. Fobi is able to increase customer loyalty by issuing digital coupons through Qples! This would be very useful for big brands to increase, not only the ROi, but the possibility of attracting customers based on promotions aimed at them! I think it is revolutionary! Fobi operates in different sectors and verticals, I find it a fantastic company. As a data first company, it is very disruptive and at the forefront of what it does. Qples by FOBI, ​​provide physical / digital coupons in minutes and they are at the forefront of what they provide, a one-time, fast and efficient solution. the switch to 8112 is imminent and high inflation is only accelerating it!"|0.44|0|0|0

Below, I break down why legendary investor Jeremy Grantham says recent rebounds in stocks have merely been a bear-market rally and the market could crash more than 50%.

**1. The ""superbubble"" in stocks is entering its final stages,** according to Jeremy Grantham, who made a name for himself predicting a number of bubbles would burst ahead of huge crashes, including the dot-com crash and the 2008 crash.

""Prepare for an epic finale,"" Grantham said in a note to clients Wednesday, adding that the recent rebound in stocks marked a false dawn. ""If history repeats, the play will once again be a Tragedy.""

Grantham forecasted a brutal selloff in which assets ranging from stocks to properties plunge in value.

He rang a similar bell back in January, when he warned that a superbubble was about to implode and that stocks could crater 50%.

At one point in June, the S&amp;P 500 traded 20% below its January peak, though they have since recovered some of those losses.

But even more so now than before, Grantham sees an unprecedented mix of dangerous elements among the housing market, inflation, geopolitics, and energy.

""Between COVID in China, war in Europe, food and energy crises, record fiscal tightening, and more, the outlook is far grimmer than could have been foreseen in January,"" he said.

While Bank of America isn't as gloom-and-doom as Grantham, the bank's analysts reiterated a downbeat outlook of a 9% drop in the S&amp;P 500 by year-end, reiterating their view that the summer of gains since June was nothing more than a bear market rally.

""There are still no real signs of a bull market,"" BofA strategists wrote Thursday, also noting that indexes haven't seen the full impact of the Fed's monetary policy moves.

**2. US stocks futures rise early Friday, as global bonds fell into their first bear market in more than 30 years**. Meanwhile, European stocks were also up, as data signals Russia will resume gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline as planned. Here are the latest market moves.

**3. On the docket:** Global Blue Group Holding AG, Ross Group PLC, and more reporting.

**4. These small-cap stocks are trading cheap and offer huge upside**, according to Morningstar analysts. Here are seven under-the-radar names that belong to a select group that has crushed the broader market this year. Get the full list.

The super bubble in stocks has yet to burst according to Billionaire investor Jeremy Grantham. He dismissed the recent rebound in stocks as a brief reprieve, noting that previous superbubbles have always been followed by market declines of at least 50%.

I've been working on my stock watchlist for quite some time now. Today I would like to share an access to it through Google Sheets: 

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Vqi0M2H8rHEOryYH6UviuqoPcCB7Fe\_8P95CAXaYwQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Vqi0M2H8rHEOryYH6UviuqoPcCB7Fe_8P95CAXaYwQ/edit?usp=sharing)

**Here are a few things before you click on the link:**

· It's a huge watchlist created in Google Sheets with lots of formulas. It takes time and RAMs to load. (I am personally using 11th Gen Intel i7-11800h with 16GB of RAM with 34” monitor for a better view. My browser takes few minutes to load the whole watchlist)

· You'll find there around 1600-1700 stocks from whole world sorted into 11 Stock Market Sectors. 

· On the very top you'll find daily gainers (top 5) and decliners (top 5)

· On every company you'll find following information:

1. **Logo**

2. **Company's name**. A lot of companies have notes included (my personal notes; notes on which money manager bought/sold this stock, when and how much he paid for it; etc.). I am updating this information on a daily basis. 

3. **Dividend yield** with notes on historical payments. Yield changes daily based on stock price change. 

4. My **SUBJECTIVE PE** based on average few years income. I left ""-"" symbol where I have no idea what PE to designate for a specific company at the moment. This the most controversial part of the whole watchlist. Lots of you will think that some of my designated PE’s are too high while others - too low. But I want to emphasize this – this is MY subjective view. Of course it will differ from yours. 😊

5. **% of up** from yearly low

6. **% of down** from yearly high

7. **Stock price**

8. **Graph of historical price changes** (2y)

9. **Graph of historical price changes** (7y - to have a bigger perspective)

10. **Market Capitalization** in billions USD (need to make some minor changes for companies that are not from USA)

11. **Daily price changes**

***But that’s not all.*** 

In addition to that, please go to the right side of the sheet where you’ll be able to find several tables. Those are:

1. Companies sorted by dividend yield. Top 199 companies picked from whole watchlist.

2. Companies sorted by my SUBJECTIVE PE from lowest to highest. Top 500

3. Companies sorted by my SUBJECTIVE PE from highest to lowest. Up to 50.

4. Daily price changes. DECLINERS. Top 50.

5. Daily price changes GAINERS. Top 50.

6. Companies sorted by market capitalization. Top 30.

7. Companies sorted by biggest stock price declines during the last 52 weeks. Top 100.

8. Companies sorted by smallest stock price declines during the last 52 weeks. Top 100. 

This watchlist is a powerful and highly useful tool for sorting and filtering a huge universe of public companies. From there on it is easier to take a deeper dive into each company separately. I am updating and working on this list on a daily basis: adding new companies and making notes on existing ones. If you think you could use this tool as an addition to your investment strategy - feel free to contact me for an additional information and access. 

Have a nice day,

I thought I'd just do a clean summary of what the fed is, what they do, and how markets are affected

**The fed is the central bank of the United States, and its goals are to achieve**

1. full employment
2. low to zero inflation
3. price stability

The Fed is made up of 5 separate components

1. **Fed district banks**. There are 12 of them

\-New York is the most important district bank due to the stock market

\-Commercial banks purchase stock from federal banks to become member banks

\-Each fed district bank has 9 directors

\-They clear checks, replace old currency, provide loans

2) **Member banks**

\-commercial banks can elect to become members

\-all national banks must become member banks. National banks are the ones we know to exist across the nation. These are your Chase, Wells Fargo type banks

3)**Board of governors**. There are 7 of them

\-each member is appointed by the U.S. president and serves 14 years non-renewable term

\-one of 7 members is elected as chairman and serves a 4-year term that is renewable

4) **FOMC**

\-Made up of 7 members of the board of governors and presidents of 5 district banks

\-Central bank’s monetary policy committee

5) **Advisory Committee**

\-there are three of them and their responsibility is to provide data and advice to the board of governors:

1. federal advisory council

\-one member from each fed district to represent the banking industry

2) Community depository institutional advisory council

3)Community advisory council

Here's how this all flows

**The fed controls the money supply**

=The fed controls how much cash is in the economy

\-Money supply is the supply of cash in the economy. Fed will either increase or decrease the money supply in the economy.

\-They control interest rates which affect the cost of borrowing

\-Most companies borrow money and higher interest rates are not good for these companies

\-Higher interest rates have a negative impact on bonds and stocks. When interest rates go up,

they must pay higher interest on their corporate bonds.

**Reserve Requirements**

\-Reserve requirement is the proportion of banks’ deposit accounts that must be held as reserves. This is set by the feds board of governors. Remember, people may come to the bank to withdraw their money. Banks must ensure there is enough money to cover withdrawals. Banks generally want lower reserve requirements so that they can make more money lending. The Fed can raise reserve requirements. By doing so, banks have less to lend out.

**Fed Funds Rate**

\-Fed funds rate is an interest rate that banks pay each other to keep up their reserve requirements. This is typically lower than the Discount rate. The discount rate is the rate the fed offers banks to borrow from them. The Fed creates a target range for the Fed Funds Rate which essentially makes it cheaper or more expensive for banks to do overnight borrowing to meet their reserve requirements. Generally, when this rate goes up, all other interest rates follow suit.

**The fed trading desk:**

\-If the fed bank decides to change the money supply, FOMC sends a directive to the trading desk

\-The fed purchases securities from securities dealers to lower the fed funds rate. This is generally increasing the money supply giving banks more reserves to lend out

\-The fed stops the purchase of securities and sells securities to increase the Fed Funds Rate. They are taking money out of the economy. This gives banks fewer reserves to lend out

All done. Hope that helped!"|0.67|4|0|4

If IV in a market is low and the FED is anticipating a 100 bps hike over the course of the next 6 months, is it true to say that if the IV for that market is around 30%, then the market is not properly pricing the anticipated bps spike and provides an opportunity to go long on low volatility? 

I’m having a hard time understanding the correlation between the IV as a percentage and the anticipated bps move.

If you’re like me and in your early 20s, this is terrible advice. Our parents and grandparents had the ability to invest in the quickest growth in human history. Think about that. Just because the last 50 years have been insane growth doesn’t mean the future will be. The economy will either be stagnant or lower in the future. 

If you follow Elon Musk, I’m sure you’ve seen his take on [underpopulation](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1563020169160851456?s=46&amp;t=UWWtwmwjDeA2twRazq5H3Q)

You may be thinking “HE JUST WANTS MORE WORKERS! HE IS A RICH BILLIONAIRE DONT LISTEN TO ELON”

Why wouldn’t you listen to Elon, or at least be curious to see if he’s right? Well let’s take a look. 

Long term, the [fertility rate](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/fertility-rate) has been steadily going down. So has the [marriage rate](https://www.statista.com/statistics/195951/marriage-rate-in-the-united-states-since-1990/).

Now let’s take a look at population by generation. [Almost 90 million old people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/797321/us-population-by-generation/). 

The last statistic I want to bring up is that 30% of men ages 18-30 are not having sex. [Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/29/share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high/)

This means less and less younger people are getting married and having kids. Young men 18-30 who are not having sex won’t suddenly get married and start having kids. This will translate into a worse economy in the next 20-40 years. When the millennials and gen Z are older, we will literally not have enough young workers to keep the economy going. My prediction is the next great crash in the mid 21st century will be due to an underpopulated society. 

These are all indicators of a slowing society. It’s not good for your long term portfolio. A healthy society would be raising children and keeping the family unit alive. 

The only counter argument people have is that immigration will solve this. Sadly you couldn’t be further from the truth. We get maybe 1 million [people a year](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/20/key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants/) immigrating to the USA. 

Less people means less innovation, less growth, and a slower economy. It’s going to be a rapid decline. I don’t want to say 2021 will be the peak of the market forever, but we’ll see.

If you think all this is bullshit, it’s happening in [South Korea](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/x5f6rh/korea_to_triple_baby_payments_after_it_smashes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). It’s only a matter of time before it hits the west."|0.26|0|0|0

# **Major stock averages slide for third week, Nasdaq posts six-day losing streak - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/stock-futures-are-flat-ahead-of-key-august-jobs-report-due-friday.html)**
*****
&gt; U.S. equities fell on Friday to cap their third straight weekly decline, after a solid August jobs report failed to ease fears that the Federal Reserve would keep aggressively hiking interest rates to fight inflation.
*****
&gt; After rallying through the morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased a 370-point gain and finished the session lower by 337.98 points, or about 1.1%, at 31,318.44. The S&amp;P 500 fell roughly 1.1% to 3,924.26, its lowest close since July. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.3% to 11,630.86, recording its first six-day losing streak since 2019.
*****
&gt; All of the major averages were lower to end the week, making it their third negative week in a row after slumping in the final days of August. The Dow and S&amp;P lost roughly 3% and 3.3%, respectively, while the Nasdaq fell 4.2%.
*****
&gt; “There’s still a lot of nervousness around what we’ll see over the next few months,” said Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst at eToro. “Yes, inflation and the job market are coming back into balance, but at what cost? Markets are still figuring that out.”
*****
&gt; “To make matters worse, the S&amp;P 500 is trapped in the danger zone – below its three big moving averages,” she added. “Those moving averages served as floors up until a few weeks ago. Now, they seem to be ceilings that the index just can’t bust through. The mood has definitely changed. While we may not test the lows of this sell-off again, we also may not reach new highs any time soon.”
*****
&gt; Stocks had been weighed down throughout this week by hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that interest rate hikes aren’t going away anytime soon. That’s put traders on watch for a retest of the June lows, especially knowing September is historically a poor month for the market. Some have suggested that if the S&amp;P 500 fails to hold the 3,900 level, those summer lows could come back into play.
*****
&gt; Some investors were briefly comforted on Friday by the highly anticipated jobs report, which showed the economy added 315,000 jobs for the month, just under the Dow Jones estimate for 318,000. Stocks rallied in the first part of the day.
*****
&gt; The unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, two-tenths of a percentage point higher than expectations. The August report is particularly important because it’s one of the last major economic reports the Fed will weigh before it raises rates at its September meeting. This data point could help the central bank determine whether a 75-basis-point hike.
*****
&gt; The last major economic report of note is August CPI on Sept. 13 and is more likely to determine how aggressive the Fed needs to be in the near term.

&gt; # Weakness on Tuesday After Labor Day – DJIA and S&amp;P 500 Down Five Straight

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cc7cc8409c0c340cadf9a7b61cfc41ee/1e21b309f0b8c0aa-bc/s500x750/2bdde9987f231ac50cf4d87e13c9fde88f4e9cc4.jpg))**

&gt; In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.03% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last five years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market’s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 0.30%. S&amp;P 500 is weakest, up only 47.6% of the time with an average gain of 0.29%. NASDAQ has a better record up 52.4% of the time on Wednesday, but a smaller average gain of 0.26%.

&gt; # Bears Back Above 50%

&gt; In the wake of Jackson Hole and more hawkish than previously expected Fedspeak, the S&amp;P 500 is on pace for its worst week since June. As a result, recent improvements in investor optimism have been entirely given back. The AAII survey of individual investors saw only 21.9% of respondents report as bullish this week. That is the worst reading in two months as the back-to-back declines over the past two weeks total 11.4 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-1.png))**

&gt; That was matched with a considerable increase in bearish responses. For the first time since early July, over half of respondents reported a pessimistic outlook for equities. Bearish sentiment's eight percentage point week-over-week increase was the largest since mid-June and the third weekly increase in a row.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-2.png))**

&gt; The inverse moves of bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread to quickly move down to the worst level since the start of July. That follows a string of readings only a couple of weeks ago in which bears outnumbered bulls by only single digits.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-3.png))**

&gt; Given the reversal in the spread, the streak of negative readings presses on. Now at 22 weeks long, it ties the 1990 streak for the second longest on record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-5.png))**

&gt; The AAII survey was not alone in showcasing a much more pessimistic tone of investors. Both the NAAIM Exposure Index and the Investors Intelligence survey also pivoted to more bearish readings. Combining these three results, the average reading on sentiment has fallen back to more than one standard deviation below the historical norm. Although that is not as pessimistic of an aggregate sentiment reading as earlier this year, there have only been a handful of other times going back to the mid-2000s in which the investment community had as negative of an outlook towards the equity market.

&gt; # August Declines All Around the World

&gt; The end of August is here and US equities, as measured by the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY), have been on a wild ride. At the mid-month high, SPY was sitting on a 4.3% month-to-date gain, but that has more than entirely been erased as it is on pace to finish the month down closer to 3.5%. The country ETF of each other major global economy that we track in our Global Macro Dashboard is a similar story. Across these countries, on average, they had reached a 3.13% gain at their month-to-date highs, but today they are down an average of 3.5% MTD. Overall, developed markets have faired much worse than emerging market countries with average declines of 4.82% versus 1.24%, respectively. In fact, there are only two ETFs—Brazil (EWZ) and India (INDA)—that are currently positive for the month. Meanwhile, China (MCHI) is unchanged. On the other end of the spectrum, Sweden (EWD) has been the worst performer nearing an 11% decline with a number of other European nations following up with the next worst performance.

&gt; With stock markets around the world giving up the ghost in August, most have moved back below their 50-DMAs or even into oversold territory. There are no country ETFs more than one standard deviation above their moving averages although EWZ and INDA have only moved out of overbought territory in the past week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/083122-GMD-1.png))**

&gt; As we show in the table above, this year's declines have resulted in the average country ETF falling 24% below its 52-week high. Those declines bring the vast majority of these countries back below pre-COVID highs as well. At the moment, there are only four countries that remain above pre-COVID 52-week highs: Taiwan (EWT), India (INDA), the United States (SPY), and Canada (EWC). This exclusive group would need to fall substantially further to revert back to those prior highs, and as shown in the chart below, each one would also still have support at lows from earlier this year before pre-COVID highs become a technical level worth eying.

&gt; # High Correlation Between Stocks and Bonds

&gt; So far in 2022, stocks and bonds have both sold off, leading investors with a balanced portfolio to experience historically painful drawdowns. Rates have risen, and partially because of this fact, equities have had a tough year. The S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is down 16.0% on a YTD basis, while the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) has shed 11.3% of its value. Typically, rates fall alongside equities, as investors shift their capital allocations to safer assets. 2022 has been different, though, and has seen selling in both bonds and equities. This has resulted in a historic level of positive correlation between the ETFs SPY and AGG going back to 2004 when AGG first started trading. Click here to start a two-week trial to Bespoke Premium and receive our paid content in real-time.

&gt; Although the 200-day correlation between stocks (SPY) and bonds (AGG) has been higher once before (in late 2009), the current level remains particularly elevated. The current 200-day correlation sits at 0.87, which signifies a strong positive relationship. In the last 200 days, stocks have moved in the opposite direction of rates on most days, as the market is incredibly focused on the bond market as the Fed transitions from an accommodative to a restrictive stance in the face of higher inflation. Interestingly, the correlation coefficient does appear to be rolling over, moving lower in each of the last 15 trading sessions. Historically speaking, the correlation coefficient has tended to turn negative not long after rolling over, as illustrated by the chart below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/Stocks-and-Bonds-200-D-083022-2.png))**

&gt; The more we zoom in, the more the rollover becomes clear. The higher frequency measures, such as the 100 and 50-day correlation coefficients, have already moved substantially off of their recent highs, even though they are still elevated relative to history. The 100-day correlation coefficient is now at just 0.70, while the 50-day coefficient is even lower at 0.55, the lowest levels since mid-June and mid-May, respectively. This tells us that the 200-day correlation will likely pull back further, thus giving SPY a chance to gain even as rates rise, and visa-versa. As evidence of this, today SPY is down over 125 basis points even as AGG is up six bps, moving in opposite directions. To make a long story short, bonds and stocks may begin to diverge in terms of performance as the correlation between the two assets begins to roll over. Now you just have to figure out which direction they'll each go!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/Stocks-and-Bonds-50-D-083022-2.png))**

&gt; The rolling 100-day correlation between stocks and bonds has been over 0.5 (or 50%) for 129 trading days, which is the longest streak since the inception of AGG by a considerable margin. Although the coefficient is declining, the 100-day correlation would need to drop another 0.2 points for this streak to end.

&gt; # Continuing Claims Catching Up

&gt; Initial jobless claims had a strong showing this week as the previous reading was revised lower by 6K to 237K. From that revised level, claims fell another 5K down to 232K marking the lowest reading since the last week of June. That was also handily below expectations which were calling for an increase up to 248K. With another week over week decline, claims have now fallen for three weeks in a row; the longest streak of declines since February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted (NSA) basis, the current week of the year has historically marked the annual low. Assuming that is the case this year, 176.8K is in line with the readings from the comparable week of the year in 2018 and 2019. Although further declines are not out of the realm of possibility, assuming normal seasonal patterns, NSA claims will likely rise from here through the end of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims are lagged an additional week to initial claims.. While continuing claims remain low having avoided the same degree of upward drift that initial claims have experienced this year, this week's reading did move up to 1.438 million. That marks the most elevated level since the first week of April.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Claims-3.png))**

&gt; Recently we have been highlighting the ratio of initial claims to continuing claims as a way of showing the disconnect between the two seasonally adjusted readings. In other words, the lack of filter through of initial claims into continuing claims, which can be extrapolated as those filing for unemployment are quickly finding new roles. Although the ratio remains well above the historical norm and especially the range of readings observed since the early 1990s, it has begun to roll over in the past five weeks. As for just how big of a drop it has been, the decline ranks in the bottom 2% of all 5-week moves on record. While that is not to say the overall claims picture (initial claims not turning into continuing claims) has completely turned around, it is a sign that continuing claims have been playing a degree of catch-up.

t3_x46xwr|1662138659|StockMarket|2022 has been a great year for shorting|"I visit this sub as well as those others that have to do with investing and for the most part, people are long their investments. I took the opposite path in 2022 and found that it was more profitable betting against companies. I literally threw a dart and whichever stock it hit, I shorted that stock. I've found that I've won more than 75% of my short bets. With interest rates on the rise and the fear of margin calls, I covered prematurely on some of my short positions in the spring. But if I had held those positions and held my nose watching my interest charges accumulate, my calculations show me now that I would have made about 4 times more after subtracting nearly double the interest charges. Since then, I've been holding short positions longer and longer and longer. All of these subs are looking for that squeeze. I don't feel it will ever happen.

I can say this in retrospect, because I know where the market is now. We are nearing June lows again, and now I'm in this position to decide if I should short until end of year or go long. I'm leaning toward shorting since it has been so profitable, and I feel the economy is just going to get worse short term. The Fed will raise rates soon, we have these elections, inflation rising. No reason to believe in growth.

What are your plans for the rest of 2022?

IHS is a fast growing Emerging Market Tower company (4G/5G play) projected to be 3rd largest International Tower Co by EOY. Rebound is imminent..|"IHS popped on my radar a couple of weeks ago when I clicked on a article highlighting 2 of JP Morgan's top picks.  

When i realized it was the leading Tower company for Emerging Markets, I was glad i clicked.. because I wish I had gotten in $AMT early in its growth cycle (bc the $AMT... along with $CCI &amp; $SBA ... have pretty much perfect historical charts).

$IHS Towers (the emerging market $AMT) has a $2B MC, but only 150k average daily volume currently. All 7 analysts have a Buy rating.. Average PT is $18 .... And the most recent Price Target is Cowen's recent increase to $27.

Has been manipulated down on Super Low daily volume (under 200K average daily volume). But that is about to change as chatter is picking up as analysts are beginning to be more vocal about IHS.  It won't be under the radar much longer- and will blow through the low volume manipulation as retail investors discover it and jump in...


*Cell Tower Leaders Market Cap**


American Towers (AMT) $122B ..195K Towers

Crown Castle (CCI) $75B ...40K Towers

SBA Comm (SBA) $36B. ...30K Towers

IHS Towers (IHS) $2B ....30K Towers


**Locations**
Currently IHS is in 11 countries- highest concentration in Brazil (Largest SA market) and Nigeria (which is Africa's largest market, and has a very young tech savvy population).

... Its also worth noting that entering the US market is likely on IHS's radar... given 2 of its board members:

Ursula Barns- Former CEO of Xerox, and  a member of the Exxon &amp; Uber Board of Directors. President Obama appointed Burns to lead the White House national program on Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) from 2009 - 2016. and she served as Chair of the President’s Export Council from 2015 - 2016.

Been saying it during all the dips and rises. 
I just think we are way too behind on the inflation curve and everything has gotten out of control, including the housing market. I don’t see a soft landing being a possibility. I mean look at what’s going on in other countries. 
Massive inflation in Europe as well.

[New record inflation in Europe.](https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/08/31/record-inflation-which-country-in-europe-has-been-worst-hit-and-how-do-they-compare)

We’re sitting at 9.1% in the US and I guarantee it goes higher. 
Sorry but that’s officially a recession..

You can see it in the prices for everything. I mean eggs are 40% more expensive for fucks sake. A staple..
Gas? 😂 
So we tapped the reserves? Who cares when they shut down major oil pipelines that were giving us more oil independence.
That’s a band aide. 

I think we’re headed down a rough path and our government is just pussyfooting. Which is even more dangerous. 
I mean the faster you attack a problem like this the better it will be in the long run but they’re so worried about election season that they would rather watch the country burn than mess with Bidens re-election campaign.
It has nothing to do with Democrats or Republicans. Both of them would do the same thing.
It’s crazy and it’s dangerously irresponsible. I hope you are all in a good place to brace for this impact.
I hope I’m wrong.

data...(13 day lag in fails to deliver since a

Short Float is much higher... (given
institutional ownership is 2.3 Billion Long
position Share)...(and given the really high
short Volume Percentage since 8/15).


Company Info:


Nu got its start by offering a digital solution that made it easier for customers to bank in Brazil - by offering lower cost products and services than the large traditional Brazilian banks. As a result, Nu has provided millions of customers with their first-ever credit cards and bank accounts. Now the digital bank is spreading like wildfire in Brazil and starting to expand throughout Latin America, a region that many consider to be one of the next big banking markets, with more than 666 million people.


As of 2nd quarter, Nu now has more than 65 million customers (roughly 36% of the Brazilian adult population). Roughly 55% of these active customers are using Nu's Digital Bank as their primary bank.
Most impressive is that a lot of this growth is organic, which has given Nu an industry-low customer acquisition cost around $5 per customer (which is virtually unheard of). Also Nu's servicing cost per customer is 85% lower than traditional banks.
Nu has also successfully starting to grow in other parts of Latin America and is now the No. 1 new issuer of credit cards in Mexico and Colombia. (Nu Bank has also been on Forbes best banks list &amp; Times most influential company list)."|0.54|1|0|1

The about-face could mark the beginning of a reversal of a more than year-long trend in which Ark saw positive inflows from its investors despite flagging performance. Year-to-date, the flagship ETF has seen about $1 billion in inflows.

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has chalked up the resiliency of her investor base to Ark's practice of being transparent with its investment research and long-term views.

""Ark is net inflowing this year, and I think it's because we give away our research, and our research is unique. It's original research. And we're trying to help people understand how the world is going to change during the next five to 10 years, and how rapidly it's going to change,"" she said in a video update earlier this year.

But now investors may be growing tired of the consistent underperformance in the once-hot thematic ETF. Since its peak in February 2021, Ark's flagship fund has lost 75%, as a series of aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and elevated inflation concerns put a big dent in longer-duration stocks that are not yet profitable.

Ark's flagship fund has lost 56% year-to-date, more than double the Nasdaq 100's decline of 25% over the same time period. Of the 36 holdings in Ark's flagship ETF, only two have generated a positive return over the past year: Tesla and Signify Health, according to data.

Meanwhile, a handful of stocks in Ark's portfolio are down upwards of 90% over the past year, including Berkeley Lights and Invitae Corporation, and Ark isn't afraid of buying the dip in its losing stocks.

Adding to Ark's underperformance has been its steadfast commitment to increasing its exposure to fledging tech stocks that saw a boom during the peak work-from-home era, with Zoom Video and Roku being its two largest holdings. Meanwhile, the fund has been building sizable positions in unproven biotech firms Ginkgo Bioworks and Beam Therapeutics, among others.

But despite the recent outflows and poor performance, Ark Invest still commands a sizable investment base relative to other thematic ETF providers. Ark's flagship fund has $8 billion in assets under management, a considerable amount despite its sizable fall from a peak of about $28 billion in early 2021.

I approach you as one of the largest trading subreddits in the hopes of picking the brains of seasoned and creative traders alike about how they like to use economic data (like non-form payrolls) to position themselves advantageously in the market.

Below I have shared how I like to leverage this data, and I hope you will share a bite of your experience with me. Because the day you stop learning is the day you start dying, am I right?

**So here's my contribution:**

Most traders know all about the effect of Fed news *on price action* whether that is with data drops like CPI,  PPI, housing sales, or something else. But that's a common place for traders to end their relationship with economic data-  Papa Powell just means volatility.

But what if you could take advantage of the various data to inform your trading?

You see, each set of data reveals new details into the story of the economy and we can use this data as traders to position ourselves in an advantageous way, enjoying longer trends and resistance to pulldowns (with thanks to staying power).

# The Market is a River You Endure

Imagine someone who enjoys white-water rafting. This is someone who sits on a raft and uses their paddle to influence their direction as they make their way down a river. White-water rafting is pretty simple, really, but that doesn't mean it's always easy. In fact there are *six class of white water,* each one more dangerous than the next. Class 1 and 2 are for floating and soaking in nature while Class 4 is an aggressive adventure (and Class 6 represents extreme danger, taking the lives of some of the most experienced athletes).

And here's the thing: *Regardless of the class of white-water, the rafter always has the same paddle.* *But that paddle doesn't influence their direction as much with more aggressive waters.* The more difficult the water the more strategy, planning, experience, and fitness are required to traverse the river. Sound familiar?

Strategy... Planning... Experience... Fitness (Capital)

# The Problem

**Now back to trading:**

We've all heard the statistic: 95% of traders don't prosper long term. There's lots of reasons why this might have some merit, but one of them is traders not fully understanding the market in which they paddle. The river is going to take you where it wants. *You can only maneuver between the rocks.*

Imagine not knowing which class of water you're about to carve through? Class 6 will rip your arms off. And I'm telling you right now that this right here is a good analogy for a trader who completely ignores economic catalysts and overall trends.

Traders like you and me can benefit from understanding which ""class"" of market they are in. There are times when volatility is low and times where it is high. Even worse, there are times when volatility is \*impending\* and traders don't know what is going to happen. Which brings us to the point of this post:

# Economic Data Drops: How to Take Advantage

Let's start with some data that is applicable today.

Non-farm Payrolls and Unemployment data **comes out tomorrow (September 2nd, 2022)**. This represents one of the most important pieces of economic data. Period. This happens every first-Friday of the month. I'd argue it is even more important during this season of inflation and supply issues.

I'm going to use a lot of super great explanations from Graeme Watkins, CEO of Valutrades Limited (of which I have no affiliation), to illustrate how day traders can benefit from digesting this kind of information.

**What advantages does Non-Farm Payroll data offer traders?**

# Advantage #1: Find Volume and Volatility

Just knowing the date of these drops helps **identify volume and volatility shifts**. After the report hits tomorrow before open, you'll notice a rise in market activity. Having a handy economic calendar for significant news helps traders game plan for a high volatility environment.

We've all been there. You do your research. You have a plan. You're ready to go... And then... ""Wtf was that?! You seeing this volume?!"" That never actually goes away completely (lol, life) but you can prevent surprises and game plan differently by knowing when these data drops occur.

I love this app for economic calendar (again, no affiliation).

[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trading-economics/id1142178921](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trading-economics/id1142178921)

# Advantage #2: Find Momentum Sectors and Hot Stocks Early

Most traders are late to a trend and find just a fraction of a run to take advantage of, missing a huge chunk of the whole move. What if you could capture the lion's share of it instead of a tiny slice?

Well, traders can **identify momentum sectors and hot stocks early** with thanks to a (somewhat) predictable market rotation from NFP data. And of course momentum can present clean trends for larger profits and safety against pullbacks.

How?

Well, to be overly simple, changing rates affect business decisions, manufacturing, and distribution. These changes in business operations have a butterfly affect of sorts that represent headwinds and tailwinds for affiliated industries. This is provided by the guts of the NFP data which is that that we get to learn about the ""total number of paid U.S. workers of any registered business; exclusions to this figure include private household employees, employees of nonprofit organizations, general government employees, and—as you can probably already gather—farm employees.""

**Notable tickers to watch** during the data drop: DXY, USD/EUR, VIX.

If you noticed my username, you might know me for my recent contributions to Reddit via market rotation reports. They're fueled more by macroeconomics and fundamentals, but are still in tune with data drops such as NFP. Here is a link to the most recent one as an example of how markets rotate and money flows according to various stimuli.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/x1gt8q/tracking\_subsectors\_this\_week\_chemicals\_oil\_and/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/x1gt8q/tracking_subsectors_this_week_chemicals_oil_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

*(Mods, if this* /r/daytrading *link is going to be evaluated as self-promotion, please let me know. I am happy to remove this link for the health of the subreddit. I do not commercially self-promote on public subreddits.)*

# Advantage #3: Leverage Group-think Self-Fulfilling Prophecies

We all know trading is a *psychological jungle.* Wouldn't it be nice to have a bead on the general sentiment in the market? **Being aware of current trends and ""group-think"" offers an enormous edge**. Take advantage of the psychological aspect of the market. Because you see...

&gt;""When jobs are increasing in number, sentiment within the market generates momentum, with consumers having more disposable income and, thus, spending more... An increase in user spending has always been a factor behind USD performance, even if its impact is often understated.""

*Side note: With this quoted, it should be known that right now* ***good news is bad news*** *since the labor market and spending is part of the reason inflation is still white hot. But that's another chat for another time, one that I am sure would be an energetic conversation.*

When traders are aware of shifts in sentiment or socially trending topics, they can find where volume and volatility are, representing opportunities for profit. And if they understand the data, they can make smart choices on their strategies as it relates to direction and risk/reward evaluations.

**Tracking Social Sentiment Manually**

There are cool websites that track keyword mentions across the internet. Watch how the words ""unemployment, inflation, and recession"" spike after the data drop tomorrow. I like this one (no affiliation): [https://www.wordtracker.com/search?query=recession](https://www.wordtracker.com/search?query=recession)

# What about you?

These are just a few quick ways that I feel traders can benefit from watching and digesting financial data. If you'd like to learn more about the impacts of financial data like this, I have some resources I'm happy to share, but I'd like to hear from everyone else. Tell us your magic sauce.

Thanks for reading. Happy trading. Long live /r/stockmarket!

# [Stock futures fall to start September as market reels on worries of rising rates](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/31/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Thursday, the first day of September, as traders continued to fret over the potential for higher Federal Reserve rates.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 143 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The moves came as the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 3.516%, the highest level since November 2007, at one point Thursday.
*****
&gt; Nvidia shares also contributed to the losses, falling more than 5% in premarket trading after the chipmaker said the U.S. government is restricting some sales in China.
*****
&gt; The major averages are coming off four straight days of losses. On Wednesday, the final day of August, the Dow slid nearly 0.9%. The S&amp;P 500 lost about 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell roughly 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The Dow closed the month down about 4.1%, while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq recorded losses of 4.2% and 4.6%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Investors are debating whether stocks will again challenge the June lows in September, a historically poor month for markets, after weighing recent hawkish comments from Fed officials who show no signs of easing up on interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; “If we retest the lows, I think it happens in September,” SoFi’s Liz Young said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” However, she added, “I think in order to do so, something would have to get materially worse than it was on June 16,” when stocks bottomed, such as earnings revisions that come in worse than investors are expecting.

The S&amp;P 500 sank 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 280 points, or about 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6%. A volatile run for stocks in recent weeks has erased much of the summer’s relief rally, with the S&amp;P 500 officially wiping out half of its bounce since mid-June.

The selection follows a landmark audit deal between Beijing and Washington on Friday allowing U.S. regulators to vet accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong, potentially ending a long-running dispute that threatened to boot more than 200 Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges.

The tech duo along with Yum China Holdings Inc - owner of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in China - have been notified that they are among the first batch of Chinese companies whose audits will be inspected in Hong Kong by U.S. audit watchdog, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), the people told Reuters, declining to be identified due to confidentiality constraints.

The respective accounting firms of Alibaba, [JD.com](https://jd.com/) and Yum China - PwC, Deloitte and KPMG - have also been notified of the inspection, the people added.

Alibaba, [JD.com](https://jd.com/), Yum China, KPMG and the China Securities Regulatory Commission did not respond to requests for comment.

Spokespeople for PwC and Deloitte said it was company policy not to comment on client matters.

A PCAOB spokesperson on Tuesday said the board did not comment on inspections. The watchdog could not be reached for comment outside of U.S. business hours on Wednesday.

Alibaba's U.S.-listed stock closed down nearly 3% on Tuesday after Reuters' report, having been up about 1% in pre-market trade. Its Hong Kong shares narrowed losses to nearly 1% on Wednesday afternoon, after slumping more than 3% in the morning.

U.S. regulators have for more than a decade demanded access to audit papers of U.S.-listed Chinese companies, but Chinese authorities have been reluctant to let U.S. regulators inspect accounting firms in China, citing national security concerns.

Alibaba, which went public in New York in 2014 in what was at the time the largest listing in history, is the most valuable Chinese firm listed in the United States with a market value of $248 billion as of Tuesday.

t3_x2dx6u|1661953218|StockMarket|Fed’s Mester sees benchmark rate above 4% and no cuts at least through 2023. Expects Inflation to fall 5%-6% this year.|"Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said Wednesday she sees interest rates rising considerably higher before the central bank can ease off in its fight against inflation.

Mester, a voting member this year of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said she sees benchmark rates rising above 4% in the coming months. That’s well above the current target range of 2.25%-2.5% for the federal funds rate, which sets what banks charge each other for overnight borrowing but is tied to many consumer debt instruments.

“My current view is that it will be necessary to move the fed funds rate up to somewhat above 4 percent by early next year and hold it there,” she said in prepared remarks for a speech in Dayton. “I do not anticipate the Fed cutting the fed funds rate target next year.”

In line with that, Mester said rates will remain elevated “for some time,” a phrase used in recent days by both Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and New York Fed President John Williams. She said real rates, or the difference between the fed funds rate and inflation, will need to “move into positive territory.”

The Fed this year has raised rates four times for a total of 2.25 percentage points. Markets are pricing in a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase at the September meeting and looking for rate cuts to start in the fall of 2023.

Mester said she anticipates the rate increases to slow economic growth, which she sees as running “well below 2%” while the unemployment rate rises and financial markets remain volatile. She expects inflation to fall to a range of 5%-6% this year and then get closer to the Fed’s target in subsequent years.

In one concession to those looking for lower rates, she said she does not think the Fed necessarily will have to keep raising rates until inflation hits the central bank’s 2% goal. But she said policymakers must remain vigilant.

“It would be a mistake to declare victory over the inflation beast too soon. Doing so would put us back in the stop-and-go monetary policy world of the 1970s, which was very costly to households and businesses,” she said.

# [Stock futures tick higher as Wall Street tries to recover from third straight day of losses](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were slightly higher Wednesday after Wall Street’s losing streak stretched into its third day and endangered the market’s recent summer rebound.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 25 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures advanced 0.3%. Nasdaq 100 futures outperformed, advancing 0.7%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Chewy tumbled more than 11% in the premarket after the pet products retailer issued weak revenue guidance. HP Inc’s stock dipped 6% after the company missed revenue estimates.
*****
&gt; Investors have sold off heavily since Friday after hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Most recently, New York Fed President John Williams called for “somewhat restrictive policy to slow demand.”
*****
&gt; The sell-off on Wall Street rolled into Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sliding nearly 1%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.1%, and the S&amp;P 500 slumped 1.1%, falling below the 4,000 mark for the first time since late July. All the major averages were on pace to finish August with losses.
*****
&gt; Despite Tuesday’s sell-off and hawkish Fed remarks, some investors are hopeful that the rate hiking cycle could be nearing its end.
*****
&gt; “We think we’re close to the end of this rate-hiking cycle, but it certainly depends on a lot of things,” Brenda Vingiello, chief investment officer of Sand Hill Global Advisors said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Tuesday. “No doubt the Fed’s gonna raise rates in September, and likely two more times this year, but they will have at that point done a lot and we will be in restrictive territory.”
*****
&gt; Ahead of Friday’s closely watched August jobs data, more Fed speeches are slated for Wednesday. Chicago PMI and ADP employment data are also due out in the morning.
*****
&gt; Wednesday’s also the last trading day of the month. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are both down more than 3% in August, while the Nasdaq has lost 4% in that time.

Job cuts will begin on Wednesday with the team working on Minis, small applications made by third-parties which run in the Snapchat app, affected the most, the report said. Zenly, the company Snap acquired in 2017 for social mapping, will also be affected by the workforce reduction.

A Snap spokesperson declined to comment to the Verge.

Separately, Snap’s Chief Business Officer Jeremi Gorman and Peter Naylor, vice president of the Americas, have agreed to join Netflix Inc. to help lead its global advertising business starting in September, AdAge said in a report on Tuesday, citing statements from the executives and Netflix’s Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters.

Snap shares dropped 7.3% in premarket trading on Wednesday before markets opened in New York. The stock has slumped 79% this year as the company has faced a slowdown in advertiser spending on the platform. Due to the uncertainty, Snap told investors in July that it wouldn’t offer specific guidance for the current quarter.

To weather the business environment, the company has said it will focus on three main priorities: growing the user base, improving direct-response advertising business and how it measures ad spending and finding new sources of revenue.

Augur, which enables users to predict the outcome of any real-world event, is one of the most well-known prediction markets. On [Augur](https://www.augur.net/) and other prediction markets like YOLOrekt, and Omen, betting on cryptocurrency prices is a common activity. 

Because GME is not yet available on [YOLOrekt](https://yolorekt.finance/), I was curious if Tesla, along with Doge, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, is a safe stock to bid on. I find it difficult to make decisions because, as a new investor, I still have doubts about my stock selections. I'm interested in which price fluctuates more because what I'm planning to do is comparable to Pancakeswaps' price prediction feature, and I want to know so that I can test the platform and learn how it works without having to spend a lot of money. Volatility is advantageous because it operates similarly to options and has no liquidation points, but even if it didn't, I would argue that three minutes is too short to make any predictions.   
   
On another platform, I previously attempted to predict the price of BNB, and while I was somewhat successful, there were no stock options available for me to bid on. This time, however, I would like to attempt to do so. GME, supposedly, but TESLA is my only option right now."|0.8|118|0|118

So why panic today when they're not yet even 3%? The real issue is core inflation that is caused by extremely high energy prices. And 4-5% interest will not be nearly enough to stop it. Covid-19 did cause large imbalances in the world and a lot of money needs to be paid back but mostly you can lay the cause of extreme inflation right at the doorstep of Vladimir Putin, the madman controlling the world right now.

Instead of stopping him, Biden and NATO tremble and throw weapons at Ukraine and say ""here, try and stop him with this or that."" NATO is worthless if it only protects its members while letting other countries get pummeled and standing by while enormous suffering and loss of life takes place. It's time NATO manned up, called Putin and said you have until October 1 to clear out of Ukraine and Crimea or we are declaring war on Russia. Never mind the threat of nukes. Putin knows that no one wins that kind of war.

So: do you think China and India are willing to risk their blood and treasure to support Vlad? They'll say ""no thanks, you started it, you finish it you crazy mofo.""

Until the Putin problem is solved, you, me and most every other living soul on this planet will pay much higher for everything as oil and other forms of energy are the heart of the economy. We will slowly bleed our nest egg until there's nothing left in it."|0.41|0|0|0

t3_x1jr79|1661867665|StockMarket|Steve Hanke says we’re going to have one ‘whopper’ of a recession in 2023. And the Fed isn’t even looking at it.|"The U.S. economy is going to fall into a recession next year, according to Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, and that’s not necessarily because of higher interest rates.

“We will have a recession because we’ve had five months of zero M2 growth, money supply growth, and the Fed isn’t even looking at it,” he told CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia” on Monday.

Market watchers use the broad M2 measure as an indicator of total money supply and future inflation. M2 includes cash, checking and savings deposits and money market securities.

In recent months, money supply has stagnated and that’s likely to lead to an economic slowdown, Hanke warned.

“We’re going to have one whopper of a recession in 2023,” he said.

Meanwhile, inflation is going to remain high because of “unprecedented growth” in money supply in the United States, Hanke said.

Historically, there has never been “sustained inflation” that isn’t the result of excess growth in money supply, and pointed out that money supply in the U.S. saw “unprecedented growth” when Covid began two years ago, he said.

“That is why we are having inflation now, and that’s why, by the way, we will continue to have inflation through 2023 going into probably 2024,” he added.

In 2020, CNBC reported that the growth in money supply could lead to high inflation.

“The bottom line is we’re going to have stagflation — we’re going to have the inflation because of this excess that’s now coming into the system,” he added.

“The problem we have is that the \[Fed Chair Jerome Powell\] does not understand, even at this point, what the causes of inflation are and were,” Hanke said.

“He’s still going on about supply-side glitches,” he said, adding that “he has failed to tell us that inflation is always caused by excess growth in the money supply, turning the printing presses on.”

Powell, in his policy speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium on Friday, said he views the high inflation in the U.S. as a “product of strong demand and constrained supply, and that the Fed’s tools work principally on aggregate demand.”

Do you agree with Cramer?"|"Longtime technical analyst Larry Williams sees the potential for Wall Street to finish out the year on a relatively solid note, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Monday.

Williams put the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s 2022 performance in comparison with the blue-chip index’s performance in previous years to see if history might offer clues for the final four months of trading. The technician found the years 2014, 1962 and 1891 all presented some similarities to this year, Cramer said.

“These historical analogues tend to be pretty hit or miss, but when you look at the years with the closest fit to 2022, the charts — as interpreted by Larry Williams — suggest that the rest of the year’s looking pretty darn good,” the “Mad Money” host said. “Despite what we went through last week, he’s a buyer, not a seller.”

Cramer presented a chart of Williams’ work that overlays the Dow’s 2022 action alongside its 1962 trajectory.

They “might as well be joined at the hip,” Cramer said. “The 1962 analogy says we could have a very nice run in November and December after some sideways action” in September and October turbulence, he said.

The home-furnishings retailer (ticker: BBBY) stock has been the talk of the town, at least in some parts of the investing world. Between June 29 and Aug. 17, the price rose about 360% as retail investors bought up a stock that most analysts recommended selling. Only a few days later, activist investor Ryan Cohen sold RC Ventures’ entire stake in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and the stock tumbled.

""We recognize the strong interest in our company and our plans to better serve customers, recapture market share, drive growth and profitability, ensure our vendors are supported, and strengthen our balance sheet,"" Bed Bath &amp; Beyond interim CEO Sue Gove said in a statement.

t3_x1hn65|1661862042|StockMarket|"Elon Musk Files Another Notice To Scrap Twitter Acquisition For ""Undisclosed"" Reasons"|"Elon Musk filed another notice on Tuesday to terminate his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, citing additional “undisclosed” reasons.

Twitter shares were down more than 1% in pre-market trade.

The latest filings come after Twitter’s former head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko alleged earlier this month “extreme, egregious deficiencies” by the social media firm related to privacy, security and content moderation.

On July 8, Musk’s legal team initially filed a notice to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to terminate the Twitter acquisition. Musk’s legal team alleged that “Twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations.”

The follow up notice, disclosed on Tuesday, cites allegations made by Zatko as additional reasons to terminate the deal.

“Allegations regarding certain facts, known to Twitter prior to and as of July 8, 2022, but undisclosed to the Musk Parties prior to and at that time, have since come to light that provide additional and distinct bases to terminate the Merger Agreement,” Mike Ringler, Musk’s legal representative from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP wrote in a letter to Twitter’s legal chief.

Ringler said in the letter that the latest termination notice is “not legally necessary ” to end the merger deal, but is being delivered in case the July 8 filing is “determined to be invalid for any reason.”

The letter on behalf of Musk said the Zatko complaint “alleges far-reaching misconduct at Twitter—all of which was disclosed to Twitter’s directors and senior executives, including (CEO) Parag Agrawal—that is likely to have severe consequences for Twitter’s business.”

Musk’s lawyer said Zatko alleges that Twitter is in “material noncompliance” with its obligations under its 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. The letter laid out some of Zatko’s other allegations including claims that Twitter is “uniquely vulnerable to systemic disruption resulting from data center failures or malicious actors,” something senior management knew about but “ignored and sought to obfuscate.”

“These allegations, if true, demonstrate that Twitter has breached the following provisions of the Merger Agreement, thereby giving the Musk Parties the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms as more fully described below,” the letter said.

Twitter (TWTR) is down 1.05% premarket. This comes after Elon Musk has filed another notice to terminate the $44 billion deal with TWTR due to additional ""undisclosed"" reasons. With the trial set for October 17, do you think this will end up in Musk's favor?"|0.75|4|0|4

# [Dow futures pop 200 points after back-to-back losing sessions on Wall Street](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/29/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday as Wall Street sought stability after another down day for stocks.
*****
&gt; Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 231 points higher, or 0.7%. S&amp;P 500 futures advanced 0.9%, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 1.1%.
*****
&gt; The moves in futures comes as energy prices eased. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, fell more than 1%. Natural gas futures also dipped.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a second-straight decline, with the Dow losing 184 points Monday. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.67% and the Nasdaq Composite sank 1.02%.
*****
&gt; The market has given back some of its summer gains after recent comments by Federal Reserve officials made clear that the central bank aims to continue its rate hikes, even if they cause economic pain.
*****
&gt; “Investors are coming to terms with the idea that the Fed is serious about curbing inflation, even as recent data suggests inflation is starting to decline,” said Rod von Lipsey, managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management.
*****
&gt; “We believe the market’s summer rally was ephemeral and continue to recommend that investors remain selective and focus on defensive stock sectors like health care and dividend-paying stocks,” von Lipsey added.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, investors will get several updates on the state of the economy, including the FHFA home price index for June, the Conference Board’s consumer confidence survey for August, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ job openings release for July.

In addition, the Biden administration has pushed for clean energy infrastructure and the Inflation Reduction Act adds further certainty to the fact that electric utilities and power generation firms will continue to transition towards green power sources at a rapid rate.

Europe could be headed for tough winters for the next 10 years and the supply shortages likely the keep natural gas prices on a volatile upswing. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that in the first half of 2022, the United States generated 462% more electricity from renewables than fossil fuels, compared to 2021 levels. The volatile energy prices will ultimately benefit the companies who are positioned in renewable energy in the coming years. 

For example, Enphase Energy(ENPH) designs, develops, manufactures, and sells home energy solutions for the solar photovoltaic industry in the United States and internationally. In the latest quarterly report, ENPH has the record quarterly revenue of $530.2 million, impressive 67% year-over-year growth due to the strong contribution from Europe, particularly in Germany and Netherlands. It is likely players in the clean energy space will deliver similar results.

My brother and I love five guys been atleast once
a month regulars. SO yes we have noticed the small price increase over time. Except this time me and My brother both told them to go ahead and cancel the order. The girl looked at us both and said ""the price too high? Ya we get about 15 to 20 of those a day, thank God cause I don't feel like having to cook the food so I luck out huh?"" 

I laughed awkwardly and said ""oh ya I know how it is well have a good one"" as I walked to the car it dawned on me... people don't have any money (I'm not broke but not rich yanno) left yet inflation is out of control. These companies asked for  more and more money for their products. 


This tower is weak and starting to lean. Soon people will start buying just staple food items and not splurge on oreas or some ice cream i can only imagine electronics.Luxury items company are gonna eat their own shoes here yall. My buddy buys ever single samsung watch as soon as it comes out. He instead will just keep his 4 and wait for the 5s price to go way down in 6 months.


My point here is if me and my brother are no longer buying five guys, think of all the people that have put something back on the shelf instead of buying it cause money is tight or its too expensive. Picture a mid aged woman shopping at any of these retail stores that our publicly traded. Then times this scenario by possibly millions.Or when  someone just doesn't go shopping cause its just so expensive. Like when money is tight people spend less on gifts for various occasions.

The lettuce the fast-food chain uses in its sandwiches comes from California at this time of year, and is not greenhouse-grown, Heidi Schauer, a spokeswoman, said in an email. At the start of 2022 there were about 5,900 Wendy’s stores operating in the US.

“In aggregate, the asset markets will decline from 20% to 25%,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television speaking with Kailey Leinz and Guy Johnson on “Bloomberg Markets.”

“The market is pricing a decline in inflation to occur in a relatively stable economy,” he said, but isn’t factoring in the impact of higher interested rates and the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening.

Jensen expects that QT and rate hikes will drive down both inflation and economic growth, and “unfortunately the inflation will be more stubborn,” resulting in higher interest rates across the curve, particularly on the long end.

Asset prices will also fall, he said. “They need to decline,” citing a big disconnect between the financial economy and the real economy. “We’re still 25% to 30% above the normal relationship between cash flows and asset prices.”

If the Fed is forced to tighten longer in the face of stubborn inflation and an expected easing in six to nine months doesn’t materialize, he added, this will make “a tough road for assets” in which liquidity dries up as profits and economic growth are weak.

When asked how to invest in this market, he said that “you are not going to be able to totally avoid this.” For investors who are long only, Jensen advises “lowering risk and being more diversified both globally and environmentally.”

Globally, he expects the Euro area economy will contract 4% in the next 6 to 12 months, with the policy makers facing difficult choices between battling inflation and fostering economic growth.

China is facing a very “dangerous” situation dealing with the economic slowdown, debt and real estate bubble at the same time the nation is dealing with tensions over another Covid-19 outbreak and Taiwan. The fact that China does “supply side stimulus” while refusing to do the “demand side” stimulus is also a problem, he said.

t3_x0orlx|1661779644|StockMarket|Sen. Warren Worried Fed Will ‘Tip This Economy Into Recession’|"Sen. Elizabeth Warren said on Sunday she’s worried the Federal Reserve will “tip this economy into recession” after Chair Jerome Powell vowed to hike up interest rates in an effort to combat inflation.

On Friday, Powell gave a speech at the Fed’s annual economic symposium about his plan to fight the runaway price increases that have impacted Americans despite unemployment falling to a half-century low. The chairman said that additional sharp interest rate hikes will likely cause pain for Americans, but that these are the “unfortunate costs” of reducing inflation.

“I just want to translate what Jerome Powell just said,” Warren told Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “What he calls ‘some pain’ means putting people out of work, shutting down small businesses, because the cost of money goes up because the interest rates go up.”

Since March, the Fed has implemented its fastest pace of rate increases in decades to try and curb inflation, which has resulted in soaring costs for food, gas, rent and other necessities. The rate hikes have led to higher costs for mortgages, car loans and other borrowing ― leading to plunging home sales.

The soaring inflation has also made the economy a risky topic for Democrats to campaign on ahead of the November elections, with Republicans denouncing President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion financial support package as having fueled inflation.

Powell said that the size of the Fed’s next rate increase ― which will occur at its next meeting in late September ― will depend on inflation and jobs data. The increase could be between one-half or three-quarters of a percentage point, either of which would exceed the Fed’s traditional quarter-point hike.

Warren said that there is “nothing in raising the interest rates, nothing in Jerome Powell’s tool bag that deals directly with” the actual causes of inflation, of which she pointed to COVID-19, supply chain issues, the war between Russia and Ukraine, and price-gouging by large corporations.

*****

# [Dow futures slide more than 200 points, building on last week’s sharp sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/28/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close-live-updates.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Monday as worries over rising rates and tighter monetary policy added fuel to a rout that began in the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 264 points, or about 0.8%. Those for the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 dropped 1% and 1.2%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was suffered a sharp sell-off on Friday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s short and blunt remarks in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, appeared to extinguish hopes of the central bank changing its aggressive course of rate hikes in the months ahead.
*****
&gt; The Dow fell 1,008 points, or just over 3%, for its worst day since May. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, for their worst days since June. The drop erased the August gains for all three averages.
*****
&gt; “Investors again cut back on their recent Risk-On positioning, supporting our view that it is way too soon to call their recent risk appetite a more permanent stance, and now one more likely to have cost them badly,” Rick Bensignor of Bensignor Investment Strategies said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile in Europe over the weekend, European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel warned that central banks must continue to fight inflation — even if it tips economies into recession.
*****
&gt; The coming week brings more Fed speeches, including Vice Chair Lael Brainard on Tuesday, before August’s nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.

I know that some more technologically inclined people just code their own screeners, but that’s far beyond my capabilities. I wouldn’t necessarily be averse to spending a little bit of money if need be, provided that the screener I’m paying for is robust enough to save me more time than the free ones can.

&amp;#x200B;

 

A few factors that affect Central Bank interest rates are -

* the demand of money in terms of borrowing within the economy and the borrowing done by local companies in the international markets
* the supply of money in terms of how much money is printed by the Central Bank with regards to the goods available in the market (if more money supply but goods are less then inflation can kick in and vice versa)
* the deficit or surplus the country generates in fiscal year for its budgets
* INFLATION
* the interest rates of other Central Banks and the exchange rate of your currency (if rates move higher or lower in a relatively stronger economy then money can move out or into your economy)
* the use of a Central Banks currency Worldwide (the US Dollar is used in more than 75% of the World's transactions)

&amp;#x200B;

**It would be great if Redditors (who have the knowledge) can discuss the various reasons for the different interest rates for their country or any other country, and how they affect the stock markets in general. It would help everyone!**

# **Powell comments fuel 1,000-point market rout Friday as stocks slide for a second week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks plummeted Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in his Jackson Hole speech the central bank won’t back off in its fight against rapid inflation.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,008.38 points, or 3.03%, to 32,283.40, with losses accelerating into the close. The S&amp;P 500 fell 3.37% to 4,057.66, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 3.94% to 12,141.71.
*****
&gt; The major averages declined for a second week. The Dow tumbled 4.2%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost roughly 4% and 4.4%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Powell reiterated a tough stance against inflation, spurring investors to weigh the implications of higher interest rates kept in place for a longer time.
*****
&gt; “Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,” Powell said.
*****
&gt; “We do believe the Fed,” said Zach Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments. “We believe what they say that rates are going to be higher for longer and we’ve seen some repricing of the cuts in 2023. We think there’s more to go on that front and it’s likely to continue to fuel equity volatility from here.”
*****
&gt; The sell-off on Wall Street was broad-based, with just five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 posting gains on Friday.

&gt; # 2022 Slams Stocks and Bonds

&gt; It is no secret that 2022 has not exactly been the year of the 60/40 portfolio. This year has left nothing safe with both stocks and bonds hit hard. Both are in the red by 10%+ on a year to date basis headed into the final week of August. In the charts below, we show the year to date total returns of the S&amp;P 500 (y-axis) and the year to date total returns of various ICE Bank of America bond indices (x-axis) through August for each year going back to their respective inceptions (each index began in 1973 except for high yield which began in 1987). No matter which way you cut it, 2022 has been the worst year of the past half century for stocks and bonds combined.

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 down a little over 12% YTD, aggregate bonds (government and corporate bonds combined) are only around one percentage point better. For the comparable time of the year, the only years that also have seen both bonds and stocks sitting on a loss through August were 1973, 1974, and 1981. The same applies for government bonds. The corporate investment grade bond index has a bit more variety of years with stocks and bonds falling in 1974, 1981, 2008, and 2015. Again though, none of those other years have seen as sharp of a decline as 2022, and the S&amp;P 500's drop in the same time also ranks as one of the worst. 2022 is the only year that the high yield bond index has fallen simultaneously with stocks, however as we noted earlier, it does not have as long of a history as those other categories.

&gt; # Democrats Expected to Keep Senate Control

&gt; President Joe Biden currently has the worst pre-mid-term approval rating since President Truman in 1950. A multitude of factors, including inflation, the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, weakening economic data, age, and a lack of definitive action on campaign promises have all contributed to the President's unpopularity. Although Americans are generally dissatisfied with the President, betting markets still project a nearly two-thirds chance that Democrats retain control of the Senate (chart below from electionbettingodds.com). The only two previous Presidents that saw approval ratings lower than Biden's heading into mid-terms (since the start of WWII), Roosevelt in 1942 (third term) and Truman (first term) in 1946, ended up in the mid-terms losing twelve and five senate seats, respectively. In fact, only five Presidents have seen their party's position in the Senate improve or remain flat since the start of WWII in a mid-term election cycle. In these five cycles, the sitting President averaged an approval rating of 57.2%, which is 19.2 percentage points higher than that of Biden.

&gt; Although only 20% of Presidential terms since the start of WWII have seen their party gain Senate seats during mid-terms, subsequent sessions of congress following these election cycles passed some significant legislation. The 88th Congress (under the Kennedy/Johnson administration) passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, ethnicity, or national origin. In addition, that session of congress banned the discrimination of pay in regards to sex, and the 24th amendment was passed (which banned states from making the right to vote in federal elections conditional). The 92nd Congress (under Nixon) removed the dollar from the gold standard and established Title IX. The 116th Congress under Trump passed the CARES act, which helped the country recover from the pandemic and funded vaccination initiatives.

&gt; Regarding equity market returns, in the five mid-terms where the sitting President's party gained Senate seats in a mid-term election year, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 3.1% between the election date and year-end, posting gains three out of five times.

&gt; The table below summarizes every mid-term election year since the US entered WWII, For each cycle, we show the number of seats gained or lost by the President's party, the S&amp;P 500's YTD performance as well as the YTD change in the 10-year US Treasury yield. In terms of economic data, we also included a look at the y/y change in CPI and the Unemployment Rate (through September), and then finally Gallup's Presidential Approval Rating. Although one might assume that a strong stock market boosts the President's party in the Senate for the mid-terms, the equity market was down on a YTD basis heading into mid-terms in three of the five years highlighted above. However, the average y/y change in CPI was just 2.7% and only above 5% once. For the sake of comparison, y/y headline CPI as of the end of July currently stands at 8.5%. In terms of approval ratings, every other President who saw a gain in Senate seats in a mid-term election year had the approval of a majority of Americans, whereas nearly two-thirds of Americans currently disapprove of the President. Given this backdrop, the possibility of Democrats keeping their effective majority in the Senate would seem unlikely, but with less than three months until Election Day, the betting markets say otherwise.

&gt; # Dividend Breakout Despite Declines

&gt; In last Thursday's Chart of the Day, we highlighted how important dividends are for long-term investment performance. While dividends do help to boost investment returns over the long term, in the short term there is often an ebb and flow of dividend-focused ETFs under and outperforming in terms of price moves. For example, up until June, the S&amp;P 500's highest yielders measured by the SPDR S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Yield ETF (SPYD) had mostly been trading in the green whereas the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) was deep in the red.

&gt; With equities broadly taking a turn lower over the past week, SPYD has held up relatively well when compared to the S&amp;P 500 (SPY). Even though SPYD has not avoided declines (as we also showed in our decile analysis, the highest dividend payers have only slightly better performance than non-dividend payers), the relative strength line of SPYD versus SPY has broken out of the past couple of months' downtrend. That being said, it has not been a sharp move higher like what was observed in the first half of the year, particularly in the second quarter. In other words, the highest yielders are back to outperforming the broader market but not to the same extent as earlier in the year.

&gt; # Two Month Rally Rotation

&gt; Using the Russell 3,000 as a benchmark, US equities peaked exactly a week ago and have traded lower in all but one session since. In all, the Russell 3000 has fallen 4.33% in that time on weak breadth, albeit certain stocks have been hit far harder than others. Breaking the index down into deciles ranked by a variety of factors, performance has generally been the reverse of what we highlighted earlier this month in regards to the rally off of the June 16th low.

&gt; Over the past week, stocks with higher multiples and smaller market caps have fallen the most. Those are also the ones that had become the most elevated above their moving averages after outperforming during the two-month rally from mid-June to mid-August. Conversely, those stocks with more attractive valuations have tended to perform better, although, here too there have been low single-digit percentage declines across deciles. One other interesting point worth noting is how the highest dividend payers have been hit just as hard as other deciles for that category which is a big difference when compared to the spring when the highest dividend payers were the only pocket of positive performance.

&gt; # One Big Clue The Lows For The Year Could Be In

&gt; Are we having fun yet? The rollercoaster ride of 2022 continues, as the furious rally off the June 16 lows has taken a breather, with the S&amp;P 500 Index finding resistance right at its 200-day moving average, a logical place for a break after a big bounce. Worries over a hawkish turn from the Fed at the Jackson Hole Symposium later this week, housing suggesting the economy is falling quicker than expected, the war in Eastern Europe, and stubborn inflation have all been listed as reasons for the recent weakness. But after a 17.4% rally off the lows, maybe it was just time for a break.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Graph-1-082522.png))**

&gt; We aren’t surprised stocks have to take a breather after the bounce since mid-June, but we continue to think that stocks have likely made their low for the year, and higher prices before year-end are quite possible. In fact, we discussed two reasons we feel this way in Two Reasons the Bulls Should Be Smiling.

&gt; Will it be easy? Probably not (It never is). One of the bigger near-term worries is simply the calendar. Historically, August and September are two of the weakest months of the year. Buckle up, as we could see some usual seasonal volatility once again, but the good news is later in the year stocks tend to do well, something we anticipate to play out again.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Graph-2-082522.png))**

&gt; Now for some good news! The S&amp;P 500 made up more than half of the bear market losses, something that indeed should have bulls smiling. As we show below, since 1950, stocks have never gone on to make new lows after this happened. Now, this doesn’t mean they will go straight up from here, but the past 15 bear markets never moved back to new lows once this feat took place. Even more incredible is the S&amp;P 500 was never lower a year later either, up 19.3% on average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Graph-3-082522.png))**

&gt; So there you have it, yet another clue that June 16 was likely the lows, and stocks potentially could be a good deal higher this time next year. The Carson Investment Research team continues to overweight stocks here, anticipating continued strength.

&gt; # Sentiment Slide*

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 pivoting lower in the past week, sentiment has reflected the move as the AAII sentiment survey showed bullish sentiment drop from 33.3% last week down to 27.7%. That marked the first time bullish sentiment fell in three weeks, and it was the largest single-week decline since an eleven percentage point drop the week of June 9th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/082522-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment picked up the bulk of that decline as the reading topped 40% for the first time since the last week of July. At 42.4%, it is at the highest level since July 14th. Although that marks a shift toward more pessimistic sentiment, reversing a trend of improvement from the past few weeks, the current reading on bearish sentiment is well below the highs from throughout the spring and early summer.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/082522-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Nonetheless, after coming within only a few points of a positive reading in the past month, the bull-bear spread took a sharp turn lower as a result of this week's results. The spread fell to -14.7 which is the lowest reading since July 14th. That was also the first double-digit week-over-week drop in the reading since June. Additionally, with a move deeper into negative territory, the spread is a week away from becoming tied for the second-longest streak of negative readings on record.

The Nasdaq led markets lower, plunging 2.6% in afternoon trading. The S&amp;P 500 shed roughly 2.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased more than 600 points, with both indexes pacing towards their worst day since June.

""Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time,"" Powell said in his remarks at the gathering in Wyoming. ""The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.”

In a note to clients following Friday's speech, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro wrote, ""In one line: Nothing for doves.""

""Chair Powell’s speech forcefully reiterated the Fed’s intention to tighten policy enough to bring inflation down to target and then keep it here,"" Shepherdson wrote.

Investors had been bracing for hawkish messaging from the U.S. central bank chief on the Fed's ambitions to tighten monetary conditions and restore price stability as inflation holds near a four-decade high.

Federal Reserve officials have asserted that imminent policy decisions will be guided by economic data on a meeting-by-meeting basis – and so far, many readings on economic activity have affirmed the central bank is likely to proceed with further tightening of monetary conditions.

On Friday, data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed consumer prices fell slightly last month. Headline PCE dropped 0.1% between June and July with a 4.8% decline in energy prices driving the index lower. On a year-over-year basis, headline PCE rose 6.3% in July.

Core PCE, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, rose 0.1% month-on-month in July and 4.6% from the prior year, marking the lowest annual increase since October 2021. Economists had expected core PCE would rise 4.7% against the same month last year.

In his annual Jackson Hole policy speech, Powell added that higher interest rates likely will persist “for some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.”

The remarks come amid signs that inflation may have peaked but is not showing any marked signs of decline. Powell said the Fed will not be swayed by a month or two of data.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered a stern commitment Friday to halting inflation, warning that he expects the central bank to continue raising interest rates in a way that will cause “some pain” to the U.S. economy.

In his much-anticipated annual policy speech at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell affirmed that the Fed will “use our tools forcefully” to attack inflation that is still running near its highest level in more than 40 years.

Even with a series of four consecutive interest rate increases totaling 2.25 percentage points, Powell said this is “no place to stop or pause” even though benchmark rates are probably around an area considered neither stimulative nor restrictive on growth.

“While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” he said in prepared remarks. “These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.”

Stocks briefly extended losses as Powell began his speech, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off nearly 200 points. The market later steadied, with the Dow off narrowly. Treasury yields were off their highs of the session.

The remarks come amid signs that inflation may have peaked but is not showing any marked signs of decline.

Two closely watched gauges, the consumer price index and the personal consumption expenditures price index, showed prices little changed in July, owing largely to a steep drop in energy costs.

At the same time, other areas of the economy are slowing. Housing in particular is falling off rapidly, and economists expect that the huge surge in hiring over the past year and a half is likely to cool.

However, Powell cautioned that the Fed’s focus is broader than a month or two of data, and it will continue pushing ahead until inflation moves down closer to its 2% long-range goal.

“We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2%,” he said. Looking into the future, the central bank leader added that “restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.”

The economy is coming off consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, a commonly held definition of recession. However, Powell and most other economists see the underlying economy as strong if slowing.

To the point

The speech was unusually brief.

Whereas Fed leaders, including Powell, often have used the Jackson Hole symposium as an opportunity to outline broad policy shifts, Powell’s remarks Friday clocked in at just six pages. He introduced the speech by noting that his “remarks will be shorter, my focus narrower, and my message more direct.”

“Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy,” he said. “Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.”

Markets are awaiting the Fed’s next meeting in September to see if the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to see if it will enact a third consecutive 0.75percentage point increase. Powell said the decision “will depend on the totality of the incoming data and the evolving outlook. At some point, as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases.”

Traders are currently pricing a close call between a half-point and three-quarter-point increase. As of Friday morning just after Powell’s speech, the probability for a half-point move was at 51.5%, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch measure.

Looking to history

The Fed is using a lesson from the past as its guidepost for current policy.

Specifically, Powell said the inflation of 40 years ago provides the current Fed with three lessons: That central banks like the Fed are responsible for managing inflation, that expectations are critical, and that “we must keep at it until the job is done.”

Powell noted that the Fed’s failure to act forcefully in the 1970s caused a perpetuation of high inflation expectations that led to the draconian rate hikes of the early 1980s. In that case, then-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker pulled the economy into recession to tame inflation.

While stating repeatedly that he doesn’t think recession is an inevitable outcome for the U.S. economy, Powell noted that managing expectations is critical if the Fed is going to avoid a Volcker-like outcome.

In the early 1980s, “a lengthy period of very restrictive monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the process of getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year,” Powell said. “Our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now.”

One concept molding Powell’s thinking is the concept of “rational inattention.” Essentially, that means people pay less attention to inflation when it is low and more when it is high.

“Of course, inflation has just about everyone’s attention right now, which highlights a particular risk today: The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched,” he said.

Investors who fund the machines, the drilling and the digging expect profits. For good companies with good assets like Sierra Metals, the highs always come. But there have been periods like today, where the lows seem to last longer than they should.

Unfortunately for Sierra Metals, mother nature and remnants of COVID reared their heads once again – to push out what had planned to be a strong recovery by one more quarter.

However disappointing Q2 results may appear, stock investing is a game of expectations not results. Though lower than expected production and the suspension of the dividend are both tough pills to swallow for investors, the future looks especially bright given the severely beaten down value of this company.

The old investment adage, “price is what you pay, value is what you get” has never been more true than when you look at Sierra Metals.

Though the company is dealing with rising costs as COVID continues to snarl supply chains and was hit with flooding in the Bolivar mine this quarter, both issues are fading away as the year progresses. Given that Sierra trades for only 3x this year’s EBITDA and 2x next years (a 67% discount to small/mid copper miners), very little has to go right from here to see upside in the stock.

[Valuation Metrics](https://preview.redd.it/9oiryhcl42k91.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98c4acf346addcd48a3cb9734ab108f0a743553b)

More importantly, potential buyout catalysts are starting to surface in the copper sector. BHPs recent $5.8B bid for Oz Minerals at a 50% premium, shows that the big players understand the huge amounts of copper that will be needed to supply the world’s move to renewable energy.

Given that Sierra trades at a significant 90% discount to a net asset value of $4.43/share (as per the company’s 2020 PEA), it is ripe for a buyout by a larger producer hungry for cheap copper. Even if we haircut the net asset value due to mining costs that are up 40% so far this year, the company is still worth over $2.00/share, making it one of the most discounted small cap miners.

[Net Asset Value](https://preview.redd.it/fye49ckw42k91.png?width=866&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3efb6b4b38d1a9aa6d4766e2e8cb0d388deff4c9)

There is a reason well known investors like Leon Cooperman of Omega family office are circling the company, he owns 6% of the company currently (Source: Bloomberg). They know that a company with high quality assets can’t trade at a discount this big for long.

Recent investors to the story likely missed the fact that the company was entertaining offers for assets within the company back in early 2021, when the stock was 6x higher.

With the operational bar set low after a difficult six months and copper merger activity heating up, we think focusing on difficult results in the past clouds the the clear value opportunity within the stock.

**Q2 Results Review**

Reviewing Q2 results, average realized metals prices were mixed – copper was down 2%, silver was down 15% and zinc was higher by 34%. Production, EBITDA and cost guidance were revised this quarter, due to lower-than-expected performance at the Bolivar and Cusi mines. This was offset by higher throughput and grades at Sierra’s flagship mine Yauricocha.

[Q2 Average Realized Prices](https://preview.redd.it/1b039e5q52k91.png?width=867&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f728dca16cd6f6ab9bb41f9f3c25250aa6a8d16)

 For Q2, 48% of the company’s production was copper, 20% zinc and 20% silver. 17.8 million pounds of copper equivalent pounds produced resulting in revenue of $49.9 million and EBITDA of $1.4 million. 

[Revenue Mix](https://preview.redd.it/u22eyld062k91.png?width=803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b28926f004e4e37bcef6fbeb678a7860d32efff)

**Yauricocha**

At the Yauricocha mine the company processed 317K tonnes – inline with Q1, resulting in 12.1 million pounds of copper equivalent produced.

The company is expecting higher production for the year, raising guidance to 49-53 million copper equivalent pounds. The focus will be on meeting max permitted throughput of 3,600 tonnes per day.

**Bolivar**

At the Bolivar mine the company processed 256K tonnes, an increase of 37% vs Q1 – resulting in 4.2 million pounds of copper equivalent produced.

Operating constraints at the mine led to revised 2022 production guidance of 14-16 million copper equivalent pounds. Management is focused on the continued turnaround and increasing throughput at Bolivar north-west and El Gallo Inferior.

**Cusi**

At the Cusi mine the company processed 67K tonnes, 24% lower vs q1 due to unexpected flooding. The mine produced 283K silver equivalent ounces.

The flooding issues have been now resolved and the the company is proceeding with plan. The focus will be on meeting current throughput of 1,100 tonnes per day.

**Revised Guidance**

The turnaround in Bolivar is making progress but is taking longer than expected, due to operating restrictions and limited ventilation related to delays on a new raise bore in Bolivar NorthWest. Unexpected underground flooding at Cusi also impacted production results for the first half of 2022.

While these are considered temporary setbacks, management believes that they warrant downward revisions for the production sites for H2 to be conservative.

Copper equivalent production is now expected to fall between 70.0 to 78.0 million pounds (13% lower than previous guidance). Production guidance for silver, lead, zinc and gold have also been revised to factor in the quarter’s impactful events as per the table below.

[Guidance vs Production](https://preview.redd.it/opldcmsg82k91.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a03810045c30f8575a5ea31b4017823c1af24e48)

On a brighter note – Yauricocha’s tonnages and grades are expected to improve (due to mining in Fortuna), resulting in positive adjustments to production for the next half of the year.

Copper guidance for the year at Yauricocha has risen to 49 – 53 million tonnes, from 45 – 49 million tonnes.

Although the company is facing a challenging year, with lagging production there are no uncertainties with expected production and cash generation over the next 12 to 15 months. Sierra Metals is laser-focused on their turnaround plan at Bolivar.

[Revised 2022 Guidance](https://preview.redd.it/22gatrvq82k91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=022ea17933417064f7404f81582b1316c159976f)

**A Note on the Dividend**

Sierra Metals decided to suspend the dividend for 2022 to both make sure adequate cash was available for the turnaround program at Bolivar, and so they are well positioned to manage through any further weakness in commodity prices over the next 12 months. Any dividend cut hurts investors, but we would rather see a management team realistic about capital needs during a commodity price selloff, than one pretending everything is great right up until capital is permanently impairing for stockholders.

By suspending the dividend payout, Sierra is saving close to $5 million a year which will pay for 14% of remaining CAPEX needs this year. With remaining CAPEX of $37 million and cashflow generation of at least $20 million for the remainder of the year as production improves, the company should have adequate cash to fund operations."|1.0|2|0|2

Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery said many of Musk's data demands were ""absurdly broad,"" amounting to trillions of data points that ""no one in their right mind has ever tried to undertake such an effort.""

The judge said Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc, has had data and documents needed to pursue his case, much of which was provided before he said on July 8 he was terminating the deal in part because Twitter was withholding information.

""My overall impression is that plaintiff has agreed to produce a tremendous amount of information to defendants, and that the information plaintiff has agreed to produce is sufficiently broad to satisfy most of plaintiff's obligations,"" wrote Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery.

Twitter was ordered to turn over data from 9,000 accounts sampled in a fourth-quarter audit to estimate the number of spam or bot users on the social media platform.

Twitter had said that data no longer existed and it would be burdensome to recreate it, although McCormick gave the company two weeks to produce it.

""We look forward to reviewing the data Twitter has been hiding for many months,"" said Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, in an emailed statement.

Twitter declined to comment.

Musk, the world's richest person, has said he wants to test that audit's accuracy because he believes the company fraudulently misrepresented that only 5% of its accounts were spam. He wants McCormick to rule he can walk away from the deal.

Twitter wants McCormick to order Musk to close the deal at the agreed price of $54.20 per share. The shares briefly rose about 1% after the ruling and ended up 0.6% at $41.05.

#[Stock futures slip ahead of Fed Chair Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were lower on Friday, dimming hopes that the S&amp;P 500 could grind out another positive week.
*****
&gt; Stock futures dipped Friday as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 87 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures traded 0.4% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped by 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The moves followed an up day for the major averages in which the Dow jumped about 300 points, and the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.4%. The Nasdaq Composite was the outperformer, advancing 1.7% as a pullback in yields helped tech shares.
*****
&gt; “Overall, it remains a really attractive moment to invest in equities. Underlying company performance is strong for the highest quality companies, and multiples are down because of macro fears. That’s the setup every long-term investor looks for,” Robert Cantwell, a portfolio manager at Upholdings, told CNBC.
*****
&gt; Nevertheless, all the major averages are on pace for their second straight down week. The Dow is on track for a 1.2% decline. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are heading to slightly smaller declines of 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.
*****
&gt; All eyes are on Powell’s widely anticipated 10 a.m. ET speech at the central bank’s annual symposium in Wyoming.
*****
&gt; Investors are hoping for new guidance about how the Fed will act this autumn, but expectations are lower, with many expecting Powell to reiterate the Fed’s promise to slow inflation by raising interest rates. Opinion’s divided on whether the Fed will bump rates by half a percentage point or three quarters of a point at its next policy meeting in September.
*****
&gt; The personal consumption expenditures, one of the Fed’s favorite inflation measures, will also be watched ahead of Powell’s speech Friday morning.
*****
&gt; “We’re likely to see a relief tomorrow unless we get a big shock from what Powell says,” Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “One thing I would keep an eye out on if we look to next week and into the fall… implied bond volatility is still very, very high for where it normally is in late August, suggesting that actually we’re likely to continue seeing a lot of action in the yield curve, which could affect stock markets in the fall.”

He is likely to address hottest inflation (CPI growth at 8.5% and PCE Price index growth at 6.8%) since 1982. The fed does not have other choices but to raise the interest rate higher to fight the inflation. According to CME Fed watch, there is 62.5% chance the fed is going to hike 75bps, pushing the target rate to 300-325bps.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uk2tukjn01k91.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3563599263ff931b2f602abe3d58ac7654cbc7d

Stocks rallied substantially after Powell’s comments following the July meeting and bond yields fell, signaling that markets perceived the chairman to be more dovish. However, last week, bond yields have risen on a chorus of hawkish comments from other Fed officials. As Fed watch tool chart shows, it is very likely to raise 75bps and it might cause the tumble again. In fact, not only the US, the central banks from the rest all likely tight the monetary policy to fight the inflation.

[Chinese Stock List to Watch](https://www.ainvest.com/screen?q=Region%20is%20China%3B%20%20%20Market%20Cap%20%3E%205B%3B%20%20%20Market%20Cap%3C%20400B%3B%20%20%20PB%20%3E%201.8%3B)

On the other hands, China is probably the only place that actually has loose monetary policy. In addition, the Chinese stocks listed in the US are cheap in terms valuation. In the last year and half, Chinese companies are down 50%-90% due to tight China regulations, worsening China-US tensions and the possibility of delisting. 

However, the trend can turned quickly due to three reasons. First, Chinese government has emphasized to provide more friendly policy on the internet player including Alibaba (BABA), JD(JD), Pinduoduo(PDD), Baidu(BIDU) and Bilibili. Second, Chinese central bank has just cut key interest rate to stimulate the economy. Third, China is in the pole position in the clean energy industry including EV (Electric Vehicle) and solar energy space. The US listed stock including EV companies NIO, Li Auto(Li), XPeng Motors (XPEV) and solar energy company Daqo New Energy Corp (DQ) and Jinko Solar Holdings (JKS). The clean energy space is expected to be very hot towards the end of 2022 as Europe’s gas prices have broken a new record due to the tight supply. On Aug 25th, Chinese has gained substantially on the back of the hope that US and Chinese will reach an agreement to avoid delisting according to Bloomberg.

“Since the June lows, nothing has happened that would shatter the illusion — or reality — of a bottom,” Cramer said, noting that oil has remained well below $120 and “the vast majority of companies” that reported earnings in July and August “did fine.” In fact, he said there’s been “very few true disappointments.”

“Without a spike in oil, which would cause a collapse in corporate earnings, then I think the June lows will hold. Notice I didn’t say they should hold, I said they will hold. The trial will come when the Fed starts selling its own bond holdings with reckless abandon as they keep raising rates. That could create a test of the lows in September, again, but I’m confident they’ll hold.”

The launch event will be streamed on Apple’s website. Apple has held virtual pre-recorded launch events since the start of the Covid pandemic in 2020. Apple is also inviting people to watch the launch at its campus in Cupertino, California.

Apple could also announce new Apple Watch and AirPods models at the event. The company is reportedly preparing new Mac and iPad models as well, but those are sometimes announced at a separate October event.

Apple is expected to release four new iPhone models that will likely be called the iPhone 14. The new devices will have improved cameras, and the more expensive iPhone 14 Pro versions could have a smaller pill-shaped cutout on the top of the device’s display, versus the “notch” that current iPhones have, and will reportedly include always-on displays.

Analysts will be closely watching the pricing of Apple’s new lineup to see if the company has raised prices during supply chain uncertainty and high inflation.

Apple could also announce new Apple Watch models, likely called the Series 8. Bloomberg said in July Apple is planning to release a more expensive and rugged “pro” version as well. Reports suggest that Apple could include a body temperature sensor in this year’s models for sleep and fertility tracking.

Apple also typically releases the new version of iOS for iPhones after its September event. This year, the software includes the ability to customize the phone’s lock screen and the ability to unsend or edit iMessages.

The report is in line with Nvidia’s preliminary earnings two weeks ago. The chipmaker warned that it would miss Wall Street estimates and that growth had slowed significantly because of disappointing gaming sales driven by macroeconomic conditions. It also warned its gross margin would drop.

Nvidia missed on revenue but Refinitiv estimates didn’t change after the company warned on guidance and said it expected to report $6.7 billion in the quarter. Nvidia stock fell over 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how Nvidia did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates:

EPS: $0.51, adjusted, versus $1.26 expected

Revenue: $6.7 billion versus $8.10 billion expected

The chipmaker said it expected $5.9 billion in sales in its fiscal third quarter, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates of $6.95 billion.

Nvidia’s gaming department revenue was down 33% year-over-year to $2.04 billion, which was a sharper decline than the company anticipated. Nvidia said that the miss was because of lower sales of its gaming products, which are primarily graphics cards for PCs.

“Macroeconomic headwinds across the world drove a sudden slowdown in consumer demand” for the company’s gaming products, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on a call with analysts.

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were higher Thursday morning after all three major averages ended higher during the daily trading session.

&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 118 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Snowflake jumped 17% after posting a beat on revenue. Shares of Nvidia slid 4% on the heels of a quarterly report that missed Wall Street’s expectations. Salesforce fell more than 6% after the company provided a disappointing forecast for fiscal 2023.

*****
&gt; The market action took place as investors await the start of the Jackson Hole economic symposium, which begins Thursday with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to speak the following morning. Traders will be listening for more information about how the central bank will combat high inflation and if policymakers may cut rates when the current hiking cycle is over.
*****
&gt; “It’s steady as it goes, it’s way too early for the Fed to consider a pivot,” said Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, on CNBC’s “Fast Money.”
*****
&gt; Investors are also waiting for key economic reports scheduled to come out later in the week, including jobless claims Thursday and the personal consumption expenditures Friday. The PCE report is one of the Fed’s favorite inflation measures, and it could influence its actions going forward.

EPS: $0.51, adjusted, versus $1.26 expected

Revenue: $6.7 billion versus $8.10 billion expected

3QFY22 Revenue guidance: $5.9 billion versus $6.95 billion expected

[Nvidia News](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/nvda/financials?ainvest_channel_token=082502)

Nvidia stock fell over 4.57% in extended trading. The report is largely consistent with Nvidia’s preliminary earnings two weeks ago. Nvidia warned it would miss the Wall Street estimates due to slow gaming sales amid the macroeconomic condition. From the guidance perspective, the chipmaker said it expected $5.9 billion in sales in its fiscal third quarter, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates of $6.95 billion.

For the gaming part, second-quarter revenue was $2.04 billion, down 33% from a year ago and down 44% from the previous quarter, which was a sharper decline than the company anticipated. Nvidia has commented that the miss was due to the lower sales of its gaming products, primarily graphics cards for PCs. “Macroeconomic headwinds across the world drove a sudden slowdown in consumer demand” for the company’s gaming products, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on a call with analysts.

For the data center part, second-quarter revenue was $3.81 billion, up 61% from a year ago and up 1% from the previous quarter, driven by strong demand from what the company calls “hyperscale” customers, which are big cloud providers.

Overall, Nvidia’s weak earnings and guidance has warned the weak economic condition. Investors should be cautious on the investments with higher than market multiples (P/E, P/S, P/B) stocks."|1.0|2|0|2

## What Are Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPS)?

The term long-term equity anticipation securities (LEAPS) refers to publicly traded [options contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) with [expiration dates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expiration-date.asp) that are longer than one year, and typically up to three years from issue. They are functionally identical to most other listed options, except with longer times until expiration. A LEAPS contract grants a buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell (depending on if the option is a call or a put, respectively) the [underlying asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp) at the predetermined price on or before its expiration date.

t3_wwu4as|1661373552|StockMarket|These are my thoughts on APE...shorts don't want you to know|"I feel APE shares is free money.

It's called a dividend. Traditionally, the company issues it, and it gets delivered to your brokerage account. Do you ever argue with the company when you see that payment in your account? No. And usually, the share price of the ticker (i.e., AMC) gets reduced by the amount that was paid out. 

AMC lost a bit more than what shareholders got back in APE. If you sold at $10+ when APE debut, then you made out pretty good. But at $7 now, it's still profit. Shareholders didn't pay for APE. The money was simply added in terms of shares to your account. 

The only question is, do you want to cash out?

You can keep your APE shares. Do nothing. The shorts would love that! Whatever you cash out is money they have to pay. Oops...did I just blurt that out?

They want you to believe that APE will go to the moon, and hold forever. But fact is, APE is backed by nothing. It is just money laying on the highway. Pick it up, or it will get blown away.

I would like to hear a rebuttal to this. But generally, when a stock falls (like AMC did from $18 to $10), that is just a typical stock market event. THIS HAPPENS FOR ALMOST EVERY STOCK. What do you do? Well, you either sell into panic...hold and don't worry...or buy more at discount. This happens with EVERY stock. Key difference....all those other stocks that fell 30% didn't also give you APE shares that you could cash out :-)"|0.33|0|0|0
t3_wwtoc9|1661372463|StockMarket|$PSHG is ready for another climb|"Performance shipping (Ticker symbol $PSHG) just announced a deal to purchase a 7th ship. This time delving into the refined petroleum market where rates are in “excess of $40k” a day. This will bring them to 6 ships operating in the spot market, making a killer profit on each ship. They also have a ship charted on a two year contract, also at a significant profit, albeit less than the spot market profitability.

Part of Performance Shippings business plan is to raise capital for ship acquisitions. They have had 3 recent offerings, which caused turmoil in the stock price. Before the most recent offering, there was a substantial climb in price surrounding the $3.7 million profit they posted and the time charter contract they signed. The most recent offering was at $0.45, and the stock oversold to the low $0.30 ranger, even dipping slightly under. 

The last two offerings were direct offerings to institutional buyers. It would be incredibly reasonable to assume a recovery to the $0.45 cent price isn’t the short term. In the bigger picture, they are massively undervalued. They did raised money, but the shares were also trading under cash value before this latest ship acquisition. On top of that they are wildly profitable as they operate in the spot market which has gone and is still going crazy right now. Compared to equity, the share price is about 3.5x undervalued if all warrants exercise. Currently, it’s about 6x undervalued compared to equity per share.

Performing in the spot market makes them subject to volatility, but with the shipping market entering a major upwards trend, they have started to reap the benefits of that volatility. Based on available figures for aframax spot rates, and the addition of another tanker ship earlier in the quarter, they should at least double their profits from last quarter. 

Depending of the financing terms for the ship announced today, they could potentially still have enough cash on hand to pay dividends this quarter. That remains to be seen, but at the very least we’re looking at sequential quarters of revenue and profit growth. 

This offering seems to have provided another buying opportunity on a massively undervalued company that is at the turning point of massive profit generation. 

They have a very simple balance sheet and a very informative, yet slightly outdated investor presentation available on their website. If you’re willing to do some dd, you’ll see this is a pretty good entry point into this sector."|0.83|8|0|8

In its first foray outside of its core direct-to-consumer business, Peloton starting Wednesday will be hawking a selection of its connected-fitness equipment and accessories on Amazon’s website in the U.S.

That will include its original Bike, which retails for $1,445. It will also be selling its strength product known as Peloton Guide, which costs $295. Excluded from the tie-up are its more expensive Bike+ and Tread treadmill machine.

Peloton’s stock rallied more than 18% in early trading.

Peloton’s Chief Commercial Officer Kevin Cornils said there are already about half a million searches on Amazon each month for Peloton’s products, despite its lack of presence on the site before Wednesday.

“Post-Covid, the retail environment — online and in stores — is continuing to evolve, and that’s something that we’re trying to understand better to make sure the Peloton of the future is calibrated appropriately for that,” Cornils said in a phone interview.

“We want to make it as easy as possible to get a Peloton,” he added.

In a research note, Goldman economists said the message will be the same as laid out in his July news conference and in the minutes of the July Federal Open Market Committee meeting released last week.

""He is likely to balance that message by stressing that the FOMC remains committed to bringing inflation down and that upcoming policy decisions will depend on incoming data,"" the note said, adding that policymakers saw the easing of financial conditions since July as unhelpful to keeping the economy on a below-potential growth trajectory.

Goldman expects the FOMC to hike rates by 50 basis points in September, and by 25 bp in November and December, less aggressive than the 75 basis-point hikes at each of its last two meetings.

Traders in fed funds futures are pricing in a 52.5% chance of a 75 basis-point (bps) rate hike at the Fed meeting next month. \[FEDWATCH\] On Monday the odds favored a slightly better-than-even chance of a 50 bp hike in September.

In March with the stock trading around $180 per share. Although the stock has been more than cut in half since, the short seller sees further downside ahead.

Chanos initially shorted Coinbase on the basis that the company would not be able to maintain its high trading fees.

""That's kind of the scary thing about this story is that we have not seen retail fee compression at Coinbase yet,"" Chanos said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Fast Money Halftime Report.""

The dollars per transaction on the retail side of Coinbase's business were actually slightly higher year-over-year, Chanos noted.

""That compression is still ahead of them,"" he said.

Chanos acknowledged the stock has been cut in half since he announced his short position, but so have revenue estimates, he said.

""This is still an incredibly expensive stock for a company that, let's be clear, is losing a billion dollars a quarter,"" Chanos said. ""And at the end of the day, that's the real problem.""

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong responded to Chanos' comments in an interview on CNBC, saying the company continues to diversify its revenue streams into services and subscriptions, which should offset any future fee compression, but the short seller didn't buy it.

Chanos told CNBC that services and subscription revenue has been flat for the last four quarters.

""It's a wonderful thing to sort of have you look elsewhere into the core business, which is of course declining, but services and subscriptions is not growing,"" he said.

What's Next: Chanos pointed out that Coinbase shares trade at a ""stratospheric valuation"" relative to other brokers like Robinhood Markets Inc

**""The tangible book value at Coinbase is about $20 a share, but it's going down at the rate of $4 or $5 a share per quarter, so Coinbase is going to have a tangible book of about $10 at the end of the year,"" Chanos said.**

With the stock trading above $70 per share, the short seller believes the risk/reward opportunity is skewed to the downside.

""Investors are taking huge amounts of risk here for what I think will be paltry levels of reward and that's of course before we get commission compression,"" Chanos said.

t3_wwjjsm|1661347559|StockMarket|Tesla’s stock on a split-adjusted basis will begin trading tomorrow, August 25, 2022.|"Shares of Tesla (TSLA) will now become more affordable to investors after the stock split takes effect. Tesla’s stock on a split-adjusted basis will begin trading on August 25, 2022. Every shareholder of Tesla as of August 17, 2022, will get 2 additional shares of common stock for every one share held. After the closing session on August 24, the additional shares will be credited to the shareholder account.

Tesla stock price is quoting around $874.36 after the share closed 2.26% higher on August 23. TSLA shares are up by 14% and 41% over the last 1-month and 3-month periods. Over the last year, the share price of TSLA is up by 25 percent but is still down by 15.84 percent since January 2022.

Stock splits are popular among retail investors and help them add more to their portfolio and also bring in a new set of investors. As retail investors have expressed a high level of interest in investing in Elon Musk’s Tesla stock, the Stock Split will also make the stock more accessible to the retail shareholders.

Elon Musk holds 23.5 percent while The Vanguard Group holds 6 percent of Tesla’s shares. It remains to be seen how the stock price reacts once the share starts trading on a split-adjusted basis.

Prior to the Tesla stock split 2022, the company had enacted a 5-for-1 stock split in August 2020, after which TSLA shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis. After the previous stock split by Tesla, from August 2020 to June 6, 2022, Tesla’s stock price rose nearly 43.5%.

A 3-for-1 stock split of Tesla shares has already been approved by Tesla’s board of directors and the shareholder’s voting took place at Tesla’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on Thursday, August 4, 2022, at Tesla’s Gigafactory Texas.

A stock split has no fundamental change to the company’s financials other than increasing the number of shares that are outstanding by issuing more shares to the existing shareholders. After the stock split, the price falls, however, there is no change in the market capitalization of the company as the number of outstanding shares get increased.

# Tesla Stock Split: Everything You Need to Know About the Upcoming Split

**When will the Tesla stock split officially go into effect?**

Let's start with the question that shareholders clearly care about the most: ""When will Tesla's forward stock split take effect?"" The answer is (drum roll) ...tomorrow. On Aug. 25, 2022, prior to the opening bell, Tesla's shares will officially begin trading at their post-split price.

Something for current and prospective investors to keep in mind is that stock quote providers, and even some online brokerages, can take a couple of hours to perhaps even a full day to recognize that a forward stock split has taken place. It's possible you might wake up and see a quote for Tesla down 65% to 70%. It's also possible the value of your portfolio could plummet if your online brokerage hasn't properly adjusted for the coming stock split and Tesla represents a sizable position. Either way, these are nothing more than data errors that should be corrected within 24 hours. Don't panic.

**How many extra shares will you own?**

The next big question is probably along the lines of, ""What does Tesla's stock split mean for my position?"" With the company announcing a 3-for-1 forward split, and shareholders approving said split at the company's annual meeting on August 4, it means the number of shares held in your portfolio will increase by a factor of three. Conversely, Tesla's share price will be reduced by a third following its August 24 close.

For example, if you owned 20 shares of Tesla at $890 per share as of this past weekend, your split-adjusted stake would be 60 shares of Tesla held (three times your existing position) at $296.67 per share (a third of the previous price). You'll note that Tesla's market cap doesn't change despite the share price and outstanding share count being adjusted.

As of August 25, a single share of Tesla should be considerably more affordable for everyday investors without access to fractional-share purchases through their online broker.

**Does this stock split affect Tesla's business in any way?**

You might be wondering what impact Tesla's stock split could have on its day-to-day operations, balance sheet, or operating income statement. The answer is, very simply, none whatsoever.

Think of stock splits as nothing more than window dressing that allows companies to make their shares more accessible for retail investors. It's also a way of encouraging higher average trading volume, which CEOs like Elon Musk understand can keep Tesla at the heart of the conversation on online message boards and within investing communities.

Tesla's share price and the number of shares it ultimately has outstanding have absolutely no impact on the company's ability to produce and sell EVs or innovate. Although stock-split euphoria can, indeed, push the share price of imminent stock-split stocks higher in the short run, it's going to be Tesla's ability to grow its sales and profits, maintain its competitive advantages, and innovate, which'll determine the direction its share price heads over the long-term.

**Is there anything else investors should know about stock splits?**

Lastly, Tesla's shareholders and prospective investors should understand that stock split-mania is a short-term event. Although investors are hyped up at the moment, a stock split doesn't mask the fact that one of the most widely held stocks on the planet is facing a slew of headwinds.

# [Stock futures flat following the S&amp;P 500′s third straight losing day](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/23/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Wednesday as investors await more guidance from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on the central bank’s tightening path.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were all roughly flat.
*****
&gt; Both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 declined for a third straight session Tuesday amid relatively thin trading volumes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished Tuesday little changed. The S&amp;P 500 is about flat on the month after rallying more than 9% in July.
*****
&gt; The three-day Jackson Hole economic symposium starts Thursday with Powell slated to speak Friday morning. Fed watchers expect him to reinforce the central bank’s goal of squashing inflation and keeping expectations about future prices gains in check.
*****
&gt; “Financial markets will remain in choppy waters until Fed Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech on Friday,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “He may struggle to convince markets that he is comfortable with tightening policy and triggering a recession. The economy is clearly slowing but it is still too early for the Fed to signal that they will be less aggressive with tightening policy.”
*****
&gt; Investors will also monitor incoming data to gauge the health of the economy. Durable goods and pending home sales are on deck for Wednesday.

t3_wwh4to|1661340803|StockMarket|Twitter will be investigated by the Congress, Justice Department, and SEC in connection with the whistleblower complaints.|"A whistleblower’s complaint opens up new political and legal challenges for Twitter Inc. in Washington, as lawmakers and regulators examine possible responses to the social-media company’s alleged missteps.

The complaint from former Twitter security executive Peiter Zatko was filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, which are expected to investigate.

The complaint was also sent to lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence committees, who pledged to conduct their own investigations.

“If these claims are accurate, they may show dangerous data privacy and security risks for Twitter users around the world,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D. Ill.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. “I will continue investigating this issue and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.”

A Twitter spokeswoman said Mr. Zatko’s complaint, which was earlier reported by the Washington Post and CNN, was rife with “inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context.”

Twitter declined to comment on possible congressional investigations.

The complaint comes as Twitter wages a legal battle in Delaware with Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk, who sought to buy the social-media company but has accused it of misrepresenting the prevalence of bots and fake accounts on its service.

Mr. Zatko’s complaint echoes some of what Mr. Musk has already alleged or questioned about Twitter’s user base and accuses the company of failing to protect sensitive user data and lying about its security problems.

Any regulatory response from Washington would take time to develop. The SEC in particular takes years to investigate and bring securities-fraud cases, and it isn’t clear whether Mr. Zatko’s claims would rise to that level.

The SEC could investigate Mr. Zatko’s allegations that the company and its executives understated or misrepresented the scope of spam or fake accounts on its platform.

To pursue an enforcement action, the SEC would need to find that any omitted or misleading information was material to shareholders, meaning it could influence a decision to buy or sell.

The SEC tends to probe many whistleblower tips and, if investigators find wrongdoing, can punish public companies that misled shareholders about material risks or financial metrics. Whistleblowers are eligible to receive payments equal to 10% to 30% of the fines collected if their information is original and helpful to an enforcement action.

Mr. Zatko’s decision to publicize his complaint is unusual for SEC whistleblowers, whose identities are kept secret by the SEC. Some whistleblowers choose to go public with their allegations because it can create more political and public support for an investigation.

It couldn’t be learned how much of Mr. Zatko’s information would be new to the SEC. Mr. Musk has waged a monthslong campaign to raise questions about how Twitter estimates and discloses the percentage of its monetized users who are bots or spam accounts.

“This reads like an overreach to make known and logical issues that likely have been the subject of regulatory scrutiny for months to appear as ‘original’ information under the SEC’s whistleblower statute,” said Jacob Frenkel,

“The SEC’s investigative process will get to the core of what actually was said to whom and what was not disclosed and why,” he added. “SEC enforcement will separate financially motivated spin from fact.”

An SEC spokesman and a Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. The FTC didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The summer stock market rally looks to be almost over, according to a recent note from Bank of America chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett, who points to data suggesting that recent gains are a “textbook” bear market rally which is poised to soon run out of steam.

The S&amp;P 500 has jumped more than 15% since hitting a low point for the year in mid-June, in large part thanks to better-than-expected economic data—including a strong jobs report and cooling in consumer prices—in recent weeks.

Despite investor hopes that the worst has passed after a brutal selloff in the first half of 2022, analysts at Bank of America are among experts ramping up warnings in recent weeks that stocks still have further to fall.

“Everyone is bearish but no one has sold stocks,” Hartnett says, pointing to irrational trading activity in meme stocks and adding that after four straight weeks of gains, the market is showing many characteristics of what is likely to be a “self-defeating rally.”

The Bank of America analyst points to the fact that out of 43 bear market rallies since 1929 in which the S&amp;P 500 gained over 10%, the average increase is roughly 17.2% over 39 trading days—meaning that the current rally appears to be maxed out, according to historical data.

What’s more, even after increasing the federal funds rate by 2.25% so far this year, the Federal Reserve is “nowhere near done” with rate hikes to combat inflation, he warns, which will likely put a ceiling on recent market gains.

WHAT TO WATCH FOR:

Other analysts at the firm have issued similar warnings in recent days. Bank of America’s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, Savita Subramanian, said in a note to clients on Tuesday that stock market valuations remain far too high for the bear market to be over. A sustained bull market remains “unlikely,” she wrote, citing indicators that instead signal a looming end to the recent bear market rally.

SURPRISING FACT:

A bear market rally tends to “always narrow” in terms of leadership, Hartnett adds, pointing to the fact that the likes of Apple, Amazon and Tesla have accounted for outsized portions of the market’s recent rebound. Those three stocks have each risen by more than 30% since the market low point on June 16, far outpacing the benchmark index.

I have a pretty good financial cushion at this moment in time, so I am looking to take out a portion of my returns and play with them in more high-risk investment strategies.

I know you can find investment info within more publicly accessible websites like blogs, forum posts, social media pages, etc, but with the amount of data we can access, I want to be a little more strategic with my investment decisions. A buddy of mine who works at a larger investment firm told me that they've been using alternative data to help infer potential investment opportunities. These firms are utilizing sources of information from SEC filings, government contracts, congressional trading, all the way to things like credit card transactions, web traffic data, jet tracking, as well as web-scraped social media data.

So, is it possible for individual investors to get access to this data? My assumption to going about this is either creating a web scraping script, purchasing datasets, or finding alternative data sources manually and fitting them into my investment thesis (i.e looking at recent employment, price of products increasing or decreasing, etc).

I'm curious about what people's experiences may have been, what sources of information you were able to utilize, as well if you achieved any significant ROI on specific investments. Hopefully this isn't something that's locked behind a 25k/yr Bloomberg Terminal.

The disclosure, sent last month to Congress and federal agencies, paints a picture of a chaotic and reckless environment at a mismanaged company that allows too many of its staff access to the platform's central controls and most sensitive information without adequate oversight. It also alleges that some of the company's senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter's serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.

The whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter ""Mudge"" Zatko, who was previously the company's head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter's leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users' data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don't have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk's attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk's claims).

After this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, ""We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.""

By early Summer, Tony Dwyer began to see the first sign of those oversold conditions. The Canaccord fund manager took to CNBC once again to call an upcoming bounce in the market, specifically in beaten down sectors like tech and consumer discretionary.

“We are going to get an oversold bounce. Sentiment and my tactical indicators are about as bad as they get \[...\] What’s done the worst could bounce the most.”

In the following month, that’s exactly what took place. While the S&amp;P rallied as much as 17.5% off the June lows, stocks within Tony’s target sectors like Amazon (a top holding in both the tech and consumer discretionary sector) would ultimately rally far more — running more than 41% off the June lows in the case of Amazon.

But what does Tony think now?

Tony Dwyer Says Don’t Rush in and Buy This Rally Until the “Fall-fall”

Despite the market delivering on Tony Dwyer’s tech-heavy summer rally, this analyst isn’t issuing the all-clear for markets just yet — especially at these prices. In August, Tony Dwyer said in an interview,

“Our call is the Fall-fall. So, once we look through the Summer rally (which I think we’re pretty close), you get the Fall-fall. \[...\] Not only has the Fed not started easing — they’re actually telling you they’re almost going to double rates from here. So I’m having a hard time wanting to buy stocks when they’re up 14%.”

One week later, following the soft July-CPI print, Dwyer gave yet another interview where he expounded on his end-of-year thesis. Asked by CNBC anchor Sara Eisen, “So you think this is just the final innings of the Summer rally?”, Tony said,

“Yeah I do. But forget about my opinion, you know I’m about the data. Remember the indicator that we use — the 10-day rate of change on the S&amp;P 500. When you have it drop by 15%, and then pivot higher \[...\] the only time where you don’t have some retest of the lows \[...\] is when the Fed already started easing. Obviously, that’s not the case.”

What Tony Dwyer’s saying is that history suggests the market might pull back from here to retest the June lows, which clocked in at $3,636.37. Tony Dwyer believes this potential second-half dip (Or the “Fall-fall”, as he calls it) will be triggered by economic weakness as the effects of consistent Fed rate hikes begin to take effect.

Tony Dwyer has accurately predicted the S&amp;P 500's plunging price action &amp; the summer rally. He now says ‘once we look through the Summer rally, you’ll get the Fall-fall’. He believes there’ll be a second-half dip (Or the “Fall-fall”, as he calls it).

The DXY is still skyrocketing. As this continues showing strength with no pullbacks the market will continue showing weakness without bouncing as we saw yesterday.

Now on to the SPY, we can clearly see how we opened exactly at 417.4. I would argue as long as we stay below 417\~ that any pop is a shorting opportunity. Bulls had no standing yesterday and that tells me big money didn't want to step in to fight the selling pressure.

417 in my opinion is a massive bull/bear line and being bullish below 417 is the equivalent of trying to catch a falling knife, there's no use doing that and that is just hero trading.

# [Stock futures inch higher after major averages suffer worst day since June](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/22/stock-futures-inch-higher-after-major-averages-notch-worst-day-since-june.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures inched higher Tuesday as the market tried to recover from its worst day since June.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 40 points, or 0.1%, while S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also gained 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Palo Alto Networks surged in the premarket on the back of strong quarterly results, while Zoom Video shares slumped after the video conferencing company lowered its full-year forecast.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a downbeat session, as a summer rally continued to fade amid mounting rate hike concerns.
*****
&gt; The Dow dropped more than 600 points Monday, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell more than 2% each. Those were the biggest one-day drops for the Dow and S&amp;P 500 since June 16. The Nasdaq suffered its worst session since June 28.
*****
&gt; Monday’s sell-off was broad-based, with all 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closing lower, led by declines in information technology and consumer discretionary stocks. A slide in tech stocks weighed down the tech-heavy Nasdaq.
*****
&gt; “The global growth story is in shambles right now,” said Ed Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda. “That’s what’s really kind of weighing on risk appetite right now because you can’t have the U.S. continue to be attractive while the rest of the world is crumbling.”
*****
&gt; This sentiment will continue to put pressure on big tech and consumer discretionary stocks, he said. Moya, echoing other investors, expects another round of hawkish pushback from Fed chair Jerome Powell when he speaks Friday at the central bank’s annual Jackson Hole economic symposium.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues Tuesday with results from Macy’s, Nordstrom and Dick’s Sporting Goods. July new home sales will also be reported, along with August manufacturing PMI and the August Richmond Fed survey.

The Intrinsic Value of NIO I got using the data from above, gives a Market Cap of $37.9 Billion, or $22.40 per share.

Some of the assumptions I used may appear conservative considering NIO are expecting to be a luxury brand, particularly the Net Income margin. I decided to go with the industry average and implement it in 2023. This assumes profitability at industry average from next year, an unlikely target. I only went with 7.5% as NIO has not yet proved themselves to be a profitable and competitive company yet so to assume a high end margin would be setting high targets for such a young company in a very competitive industry

The revenue assumptions may appear low, but I got them from the source I linked above.

**Risks**

There are several risks that can be seen with NIO that not many people seem to be highlighting

1. Currency Fluctuations. NIO is a Chinese company and as China is a net exporting company they benefit from having a weaker currency meaning a higher likelihood of NIOs revenue to be negatively affected from the perspective of a non Chinese citizen
2. Shares Outstanding have increased by 60% in the past 2 years. This dilutes you as a shareholder decreasing the value of your stock
3. Many companies in the Automaker industry have high debt. NIO doesn't currently have much debt, however in order to compete in a competitive industry and to keep growing they may have to take on much more debt in the future
4. Chinas weak economic outlook. China has been one of the fastest growing economies in the world over the last couple of decades, unfortunately their fast economic growth has caused a large housing bubble in the country. A recession like 2008 could cause growth in China to stall, and weak infrastructure to collapse resulting in a lower demand for high end electric vehicles
5. Tensions with the western world may cause the Chinese government to force public companies to become nationalized. NIO has heavy ties to the Chinese government
6. Hydrogen cars. Hydrogen cars could become a large competitor to the electric vehicle market due to their similarity to ICE vehicles and fast refueling time
7. High competition. Many new car companies have recently entered the market such as NIO, Lucid, Li Auto, Rivian, Xpeng, Nikola and Fisker. Some of these and other more mature car companies will be competing with each other. This will force margins down. Others may be forced to merge or fail. How do we know NIO wont be one to fail?

Considering all these risk factors, a high margin of safety may be needed in order to ensure money wont be lost when investing in NIO. 

Margin of safety is always subjective to an individuals confidence in their projections and risk tolerance, however the more confident you are the more at risk you are at being cocky when it comes to investing. That is why whenever I evaluate a business I always make sure there is at least a 25% margin of safety. 

That would give NIO a buy price of $16.80.

That is using my standard margin of safety though. Personally due to the high risks involved in a stock from a foreign country that has tensions with the west, is in a competitive industry, has been disappointing with deliveries so far this year and isn't profitable yet a margin of safety personally for me would go up to 45 - 50%.

That would give NIO a buy price personally of $11.20 - $12.32, which is near their 52 week low of $11.67"|0.6|1|0|1

Dorsey stepped down as Twitter CEO for the second time last November and handed control of the company he helped create to Parag Agrawal. He’s running Square and Block and, reportedly, egging on Musk’s attempt to buy Twitter in private messages.

It’s tough to say what information Dorsey has that Musk couldn’t obtain by just texting him! But with billions of dollars on the line, Musk’s legal team is casting out all lines to support his (weak) argument the company is not telling the truth about measurements of bots and spam among the daily active users on its platform. The subpoena lists what information Dorsey is being asked for, which includes documents related to “the impact or effect of false or spam accounts on Twitter’s business and operations, Twitter’s use of mDAU as a Key Metric,” and “any process or workflow, other than the mDAU Audit and the suspension workflow, that Twitter uses, has used, or has discussed or considered using to detect and label accounts as spam or false.”

A recent ruling by Judge Kathaleen McCormick also gave Musk’s team access to information from the former Twitter head of product Kayvon Beykpour, and in a separate filing today, Musk’s team subpoenaed the other Twitter exec Agrawal fired on the same day as Beykpour, Bruce Falck.

""The signing of the Inflation Reduction Act was the equivalent of 'Christmas in August' for Elon Musk &amp; Co., as we peg Tesla as the biggest winner from the new law, as most versions of the industry's two bestselling EVs (Tesla's Model Y and Model 3) become eligible for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit effective January 1, 2023,"" Nelson wrote in a note to clients. ""Previously, all Tesla vehicles had phased out of tax credit eligibility after hitting the 200K units per manufacturer cap.""

Nelson lifted his price target on Tesla's stock to $1,245 from $1,125, which now assumes a 43% upside from current trading levels. Tesla's stock is Nelson's top pick from the auto sector.

The Inflation Reduction Act serves up a $7,500 tax credit to consumers for EVs priced up to $80,000 for trucks and $55,000 for cars. To qualify for the tax credit, buyers must earn less than $150,000 in household income if single or $300,000 as a household if married. The tax credit applies only to EVs assembled in North America.

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Monday following a halt in the summer rally last week, as fears of aggressive interest rate hikes returned to Wall Street.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 321 points, or by 0.95%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 1.22% and 1.57%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Those moves come as European markets experienced steep declines, driven in part by worries of rising inflation and higher interest rates around the world.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 closed down 1.29%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 292 points, or 0.86%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.01%. The major averages also posted weekly losses.
*****
&gt; Investors are anticipating what could be a volatile week of trading ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s latest comments on inflation at the central bank’s annual Jackson Hole economic symposium.
*****
&gt; “Fed Chair Powell is likely to sound meaningfully more hawkish during his Jackson Hole speech on Friday morning at 10am ET than he did at his July 27th press conference, when he said the fed funds rate is already back to neutral,” according to a Monday report from Wolfe Research’s Chris Senyek.
*****
&gt; On the earnings front, traders are expecting Palo Alto Networks and Zoom Video to report results Monday after the bell.

&amp;#x200B;

Markets red across the board, -1% on the SP500, -1.4% on tech as of 7:10am.

First things first, we are not algorithmically overextended to the downside on the ES (SPY) on a 4 hour chart.

 As you can see we are opening outside of the lower level, usually when this happens at the bare minimum we return back to the lower bband line. So I'm expecting some sort of a bounce in the early AM, but that can happen before NY opens so I'm expecting us to bounce around 417-419. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the SPY itself, you can see we have come straight to the 417.4 area of support. You'd have to be crazy to try to heavily short at support, ,after a big move down. If you want to play the momentum to the downside, you should not do so with size and ideally wait for retests of resistance.

This is why I will be leaning more bullish at the open for a bounce to 419-420 which is where I think the market will make a decision. Hoping for the market to remain as red as possible before we open!

If on the SPY we open below 418 I would like to grab some lotto weekly $423-$425 calls.

I'm also expecting decent sized moves in the early morning price action but overall you have to buy calls at support and that's where we are!"|0.62|2|0|2

Between 1971 and the early 1980s, the postwar monetary order anchored on Bretton Woods fell apart, currencies gyrated, inflation surged, and so too did unemployment. The disorder was brought to an end after 1979 by hiking the federal funds rate to 19 percent, which squeezed inflation out of the system by making credit scarce, which precipitated a major recession.

To emphasize this key point about the persistence of the Fed's inflation fight, consider the period from 1970 through 1982 in the chart below.

The inflation rate was rising sharply heading into the 1970 recession, and the Fed Funds rate was rising accordingly. But once the economy fell into recession, the Fed started cutting interest rates just before the inflation rate had peaked. So while the inflation rate declined during and after this recession, it bottomed at an elevated rate before turning back higher again.

The Fed once again raised interest rates as inflation surged into the 1973-74 recession, but once again the Fed started cutting interest rates around the time that the inflation rate peaked. Inflation eventually came down after the 1973-74 recession, but once again topped at an even higher level before rising again.

In 1979, inflation was raging out of control, and the public was deeply angry. It was the time when Paul Volcker was nominated to take G. William Miller’s place as chair of the Federal Reserve. After his nomination, on September 30, 1979, Volcker attended the International Monetary Fund’s annual meeting in Belgrade. He watched former Fed Chair Arthur Burns’s [lecture](http://www.perjacobsson.org/lectures/1979.pdf) explaining that central banks were impotent to control inflation because society simply wouldn’t tolerate the recession that would be necessary.

Volcker left the conference early and returned to Washington to put the finishing touches on a new approach. One week later he convened a rare off-schedule Saturday meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The program they adopted was the central banking version of shock and awe, designed to break the inflationary psychology that had gripped the country.

The Fed raised interest rates to combat the spiraling inflation problem, but even after the inflation rate was definitively coming down, the Fed kept its foot on the gas. It continued to raise interest rates for a period, then keep interest rates high until the pricing fever was finally broken and inflation came back down to much lower levels. This was a process that played out over a few years, not a few months.

The victory would be neither quick nor cheap. It would provoke protests and the highest unemployment rates since the Great Depression. But it would also lay the foundation for the Great Moderation, an unusually tranquil period in the macroeconomy characterized by solid income growth, shallow recessions, and strong stock price gains.

Volcker understood that central banks have the ultimate responsibility for controlling inflation, and he was prepared to take the aggressive action required to do it.

the looseness of US monetary policy during the 1970s strongly suggests that – in spite of the obvious inflationary impact of food, and especially oil price shocks during that decade – an excessively accommodative monetary policy might have played a crucial role in allowing US inflation to take off and endure. Counting on inflation to fall could lead to policy errors that could actually prevent it from happening.

### Lessons from the Great Inflation

1. The experience of the 1970s informs today’s mainstream view that it is important to act preemptively to forestall the buildup of inflationary expectations. This is crucial because it is the expectation of future inflation among workers and industries that drives wage and price increases, which in turn generate further inflation.
2. The stability of inflation expectations should never be taken for granted. The US experience of the second half of the 1960s is, in this respect, especially illuminating and sobering: with inflation steadily increasing, from slightly above 1% at the beginning of 1965, to more than 5% in the early 1970s, inflation expectations, which had remained remarkably stable until the mid-1960s, started to drift progressively upwards, in reaction to actual inflation outcomes. This clearly shows that just a few years of systematically disappointing inflation outcomes can rapidly unanchor inflation expectations.
3. The importance of the reputation and credibility of the central bank, according to Alan Blinder, depends on “matching words with deeds”, i.e. validating policy announcements with actual outcomes. In fact, policy-makers of the 1960s and 1970s were perfectly aware of the crucial importance, for the purpose of keeping inflation expectations firmly anchored, and maintaining a strong anti-inflationary reputation, and that the only way to achieve that was to actually deliver low and stable inflation. In his February 1965 testimony to the JEC, for example, Federal Reserve Chairman Martin warned about the dangers associated with an upward drift in inflation, and with the resulting, likely loss of credibility and dislocation of inflation expectations, warning that failure to prevent an upward drift in inflation might set off an inflationary spiral. His words proved prescient, to the point that only four years later, in the same venue, he concluded that “public skepticism about the Government’s ability to “do something” about prices has its roots in this history of ever-quickening in action.

### The Federal Reserve has to implement the 1970s playbook in bringing down the inflation

The Federal Reserve has lost control of inflation, and the cost of bringing it back on target may well be a recession. Worse news: Whenever the next really serious downturn hits, the Fed won’t have adequate tools to fight it.

That one-two punch risks blowing a giant hole in the Fed’s credibility. What, the American public might reasonably ask, is the point of a central bank that allows the inflation rate to reach 9%, and then also can’t protect jobs?

Even more concerning are new signs that families have lost faith in the Fed’s policies. Consumer sentiment in June sank to a low not seen since the 1980 recession, [according to](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/) a University of Michigan survey.

The Fed must bring back its credibility and if the Fed is following the playbook learned from its past inflation fights, the game plan calls for continued rate hikes even after the high inflation fever is broken, and keeping rates high for a stretch even after inflation has come back down.

More importantly, Investors should know that given the lessons of past inflation episodes coupled with where the current inflation rate is relative to the Fed Funds rate, the Fed has essentially no room to start cutting interest rates anytime soon. Instead, they need to maintain interest rates as high as they can reasonably raise them well after the inflation rate comes back down to help protect against any future inflation resurgence that may be inevitable anyway given how late they were in starting to respond and how far behind they remain in the process.

If the Fed betrays this strategy and becomes distracted by slowing growth and/or falling financial asset prices, they run the risk of making matters far worse for far longer by clearing the way for an even bigger inflation spike the next time around.

It’s also possible to imagine that the Fed will face a very different environment in the years ahead. De-globalization, aging populations, and the fight against climate change could shift the balance in the economy and require a higher federal funds rate to keep inflation in check. That would make it harder for the US economy to grow, but also give the Fed more space to cut rates when recessions hit. That’s an intriguing possibility. For now, though, it’s not one that the Fed—or the markets—are betting on.

**First, the Fed must** bring down inflation—even at the expense of a recession. Then it’s essential to rethink fiscal stimulus, financial regulation, and the Fed’s tool kit. None of the options is easy. Still, the choice is between a US economy where the Fed has credibility as an inflation fighter and—working with Congress—the tools to fight recessions, and one where it does not.

The right path is obvious. The hopeful message from 109 years of Fed history is this: The failures of the current crisis might galvanize the political will to take it.

If we take as a reference the fall of the Great Recession of 2007, it was a fall of 57% during 518 days that means 17 continuous months of fall, the situation was terrible.  
Extrapolating it to 2022, taking into account that the fall lasted that long and the fall was -57%, it replicates so far the trend and movements of 2007.

# **Stocks fall Friday to notch weekly loss, S&amp;P 500 snaps 4-week-long rally - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/18/stock-market-news-live-updates-futures-open-to-close.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks tumbled on Friday as Wall Street’s summer rally faltered and rate hike fears resurfaced, leading the major averages to end the week on a sour note.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.29% to close at 4,228.48, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 292.30 points, or 0.86%, to 33,706.74. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.01% to settle at 12,705.22.
*****
&gt; For the week, the S&amp;P edged 1.21% lower, while the Dow slipped 0.16%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed out the week down 2.62%.
*****
&gt; Friday’s halt in Wall Street’s summer rally came as minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting and comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard indicated that the central bank would likely continue hiking rates in the near term, putting a damper on investors’ hopes of a slowdown.
*****
&gt; Despite the week’s moves, many investors and traders are holding out hope for a bounce back.
*****
&gt; “I wouldn’t expect a complete reversal going back to the June lows or something like that, however, the choppiness we’re seeing today and this week does reflect a lot of the bear case that’s out there,” said FBB Capital Partners’ Mike Bailey. “I think seeing the market trade sideways or seeing a bit of a pause in that rally definitely makes sense based on some of the facts that we’re seeing out there.”
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares cratered more than 40% after Ryan Cohen dumped his entire stake in the retailer. The move seemed to dampen sentiment among meme stock traders who have bet big on the company in recent months.
*****
&gt; In other news, about a $2 trillion notional value worth of options contracts expired on Friday. Options expirations can add volatility to markets as some holders may be forced to move into their positions.

&gt; Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble madness. Although September’s overall rank improves modestly in midterm years going back to 1950, average losses widen for DJIA (–0.8%), NASDAQ (–0.8%), Russell 1000 (–1.0%) and Russell 2000 (–0.8%). S&amp;P 500’s average September loss improves slightly from –0.5% to –0.4% in midterm years. Although September 2002 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA has declined in 11 of the last 18 midterm-year Septembers.

&gt; # Total Return vs Price Change Spreads

&gt; As we mentioned in today's Chart of the Day, there can be a wide spread between total returns and price change based on dividend yield. Although it doesn't always make financial sense for a company to pay dividends, they can certainly magnify returns all else equal. Click here to start a two-week trial to Bespoke Premium and receive our paid content in real-time.

&gt; The table below outlines twenty S&amp;P 500 stocks that have seen a high percentage of their returns over the last twenty years come from dividends. The average stock on this list has seen over 80% of their gains over the last two decades come from dividends alone. Although the average stock on this list has only seen a price gain of 61.1% since August of 2002, their average total return when factoring in dividends re-invested has been 278%.

&gt; # Bulls Set a New High

&gt; Bullish sentiment continued its recent run of increases according to the weekly AAII individual investor sentiment survey. Hitting 33.3% this week, bulls are at the highest level since the last week of 2021. That 2022 is nearly 2/3 complete and we still haven't seen a bullish reading over 33.3% tells you how negative investors have been this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081822-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Bears also ticked up this week reaching 37.2% versus 36.7% last week. While bearish sentiment has only been below 40% for three weeks in a row, that is the longest stretch of sub-40% readings since the start of the year.

&gt; With both bulls and bears higher, neutral sentiment was the only reading to fall this week. Neutral sentiment dropped 1.7 percentage points from 31.2% down to 29.5%. That was only the lowest reading in four weeks as neutral sentiment sits the closest to its historical average of 31.4%.

&gt; # 10-Day A/D Line Overbought for 15 Days

&gt; In an earlier tweet, we pointed out the elevated readings across 10-day advance decline lines in our Sector Snapshot. Not only is the 10-Day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500 approaching one-year highs (as of yesterday's close), but it has been ""overbought"" for the last 15 trading days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-10-day.png))**

&gt; Going back to the start of our data in 1990, there have only been eight other times in which the S&amp;P 500's 10-day A/D line has been overbought for 15 days in a row or more. The last time such a steak was observed was at the start of 2019 which ended at 22 days. That tied for the March 2016 streak for the longest on record back to 1990. We would also note that other than one streak in the first couple of months of 1991, nearly all of these long streaks with an overbought 10-day A/D line occurred since 2010. In other words, consistently impressive breadth by this measure has largely been a recent phenomenon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Streak1.png))**

&gt; This is not the only impressive breadth signal we have covered of late. For example, in yesterday's Chart of the Day we highlighted that more than 90% of S&amp;P 500 stocks were above their 50-DMAs. Prior times when we've seen that reading spike above 90% have been followed by strong returns in the months and year ahead. Looking at the past times in which the 10-day advance decline line has been overbought for 15 days in a row, forward performance of the S&amp;P 500 has not been considerably stronger than the norm. From that 15th day, the S&amp;P has risen half the time one week out. One and three month returns are more consistently positive but weaker than the norm on a median basis. In the year after the long overbought A/D streaks listed below, though, the S&amp;P was higher 7 of 8 times for an average gain of 11.1%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Table.png))**

&gt; Below is a chart of the S&amp;P 500 since its 2009 Financial Crisis low. As shown, most of these overbought A/D line streaks have occurred as the index was recovering from some sort of sell off. Only one of them (in early 2018) came about at the time of a notable peak in the index.

&gt; # Moving Averages Putting Up a Fight

&gt; Just as the S&amp;P 500 ran into some resistance yesterday at its 200-day moving average (DMA), we've seen the same pattern play out in a number of commodities. Two of the more high-profile ones have been copper and crude oil.

&gt; Copper fell out of bed in the late spring and early summer, losing a third of its value. Along with the equity market, copper has seen a late-summer rally, but things came to a screeching halt right at the 50-DMA last Thursday. Copper has been down on two of the last three trading days and hasn't been able to trade back above that elusive 50-DMA since.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-Copper.png))**

&gt; Crude oil has been just as weak as copper lately, trading in a well-defined downtrend and breaking below its 200-DMA in early August. There was a little bit of a bounce last week, but resistance came into play at the 200-DMA, and after making another lower high, it has since made another lower low.

&gt; When stock, commodity, bond, or any other asset class is in a well-defined downtrend, the first thing they have to do to break out of their funks is clear resistance at key moving averages like the 50 and/or 200-DMA. In the case of copper and crude, they have both recently come up short. The S&amp;P 500, again, is facing some resistance at its 200-DMA, but at least it has managed to clear its 50-DMA which it did in the second half of July.

&gt; # Summer Rally Top: Almanac Aggregate Cycle

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/7e8069b2c2bd4e8de914d770f3d6de87/4c5d67735406068a-67/s500x750/5166d3e30c8566f6c5b3725cdf1409b76e765d5a.jpg))**

&gt; Bear market rally or new bull, the 2022 summer rally looks like its run it’s course. With the summer rally pushing DJIA up 13.5% from the June low with S&amp;P up 17.2% and NASDAQ up 23.3% here’s what we are looking at.

&gt; This impressive comeback rally pushed through technical resistance at the June highs. But our indicators and cycles analysis suggest another leg down that culminates in a lower low or retest of the lows at some point in the weak seasonal period August-October ahead of the midterm election.

&gt; Last week’s inflation numbers were certainly encouraging. But we would like to see further confirmation before moving into the bullish camp. We are bullish for Q4 and 2023 but remain vigilant about the potential for another leg down that either tests the June lows or makes a new low.

&gt; In preparation for the 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac, we developed this brand-new Stock Trader’s Almanac Aggregate Cycle index (STAAC). STA Aggregate Cycle is a combination of the 1-Year Seasonal Pattern for All Years, the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle and the Decennial Cycle. In the chart here STAAC is all years, midterm years and second years of decades post-WWII from 1946-2021.

&gt; # Housing Descending

&gt; Updates on Building Permits and Housing Starts were mixed relative to expectations for July. While Building Permits exceeded forecasts by 34K, Housing Starts missed forecasts by 81K falling to the lowest annualized rate (1.446 million) since February 2021. Housing represents a large share of the US economy on both a direct and indirect basis, so its health says about the state of the overall economy, Below we have updated our chart of Housing Starts on an average 12-month basis overlaid on top of recessions. Every recession since the late 1960s has been preceded by a rollover in the average rate of Housing Starts, and usually, the rollover starts well in advance of the recession.

&gt; For the current period, Housing Starts remain right near their highest levels of the cycle, but if you look real closely, you can see that the level peaked three months ago. Looking out over history, there are plenty of other periods where Starts declined for a few months but didn't roll over. In other words, based on what we've seen so far, Housing Starts have yet to show signals of an imminent recession. Based on this month's reading and the readings from a year ago, barring a major rebound, the 12-month average is likely to keep declining in the months ahead. Another factor to keep in mind about the historical relationship between Housing Starts and recessions is that in most cases, the recession didn't usually begin until months after the peak of Housing Starts.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Housing-Starts-12-M.png))**

&gt; Taking a closer look at recent trends, the chart below shows the 12-month average of Building Permits and Housing Starts since the start of 2010. It's easier here to see the decline in Starts over the last few months. Building Permits, meanwhile, have continued to trend higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Starts-and-Permits.png))**

&gt; On a single-family basis, though, both Building Permits and Housing Starts have shown signs of rolling over. Single-family Housing Starts have been moving sideways for over a year now and have just recently seen an acceleration in the rate of decline while Building Permits have been trending lower for a full year now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081622-Starts-and-Permits-Single.png))**

&gt; Finally, the chart below compares the performance of Housing Starts over time to the performance of homebuilder stocks using the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) as a proxy. While the two have tended to track each other over time, over the last couple of months, ITB has rallied while Housing Starts have been dropping. Either the market knows something about future developments in the residential housing market or investors have gotten a little offside in their positioning.

Fundamental Research released a new research report on GCM Mining Corp. TSX: GCM / OTCQX: TPRFF - formerly Gran Colombia Gold 

The report focuses on the possibility of an acquisition; here are some highlights. 

GCM is trading at a 60% discount to junior gold producers, and remains one of the very few dividend-paying junior gold miners. Its forward yield of 5.4% is 85% higher than the average of senior producers. Forward EV/EBITDA is 1.0x vs the comparables average of 3.4x.

Shareholders of both GCM and Aris Gold (TSX: ARIS) are meeting next month to vote on the proposed acquisition of Aris by GCM. 

The analyst at Fundamental Research believe GCM shareholders are likely to approve the deal due to the attractive valuation metrics.

Finally, Fundamental Research’s analysts are expecting a rally in gold prices as the Fed is likely to take a less hawkish stance in its meeting next month due to weaker economic activities and GDP growth and as inflation has started to taper.

Production that increases efficiencies for manufacturing will have an advantage as their customers transition to lower their carbon footprint.

Let’s look at a mining company that is able to take advantage of the growing demand for renewables and greener applications  – Largo Inc. and there Q2 performance.  

**Great Production Results**

Largo Inc. (TSE:LGO) (NASDAQ:LGO) reported an improvement in both production and sales results for the second quarter highlighted by a net income increase of $18.0 million, which represents a 113% growth year over year increase from the comparative quarter in the previous year.

Production increased a strong 26% over the Q1 2022, while sales volumes were up even more, increasing almost 50%. The improvement in production and sales in Q2 2022 was due to improved operational stability at the Company’s vanadium plant as well as the re-establishment of inventories after the abnormally elevated levels of rainfall experienced in Q4 2021. As a result of strong vanadium prices during the quarter, overall revenue doubled quarter over quarter and was up 56% over the same quarter in 2021.

[Largo Q2 2022 Snapshot](https://preview.redd.it/sakka5u1loi91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fe436b5245d501dcc8b0425ce77571a939eef54)

**Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries (VRFBS)**

Largo continues to set new milestones with its strategy to advance the commercial rollout of its VCHARGE Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB) technology. After the quarter, the company announced they have signed a non-binding MOU with Ansaldo Green Tech for the manufacturing and commercial deployment of VRFBs throughout Europe, The Middle East and Africa power generation markets.

Further complimenting this strategy includes the award in funding by the Department of Energy to Largo Clean Energy of US$4.2 million. The funding is to develop and demonstrate efficient manufacturing processes, scalable to the high production volumes needed to meet the projected demand for VRFBs. This tells us the US government likes the technology enough to make sure it can be produced at scale.

Largo expects to complete the DOE project in three years.

[VRFBs - Funding &amp; Commercial Deployment](https://preview.redd.it/c6eg4id7loi91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d67797dc8eb4ffa9add1a384c0b784961bfa365c)

Largo generated close to record production in the second quarter hitting a production level of 3,084 tonnes of V2O5.

**Vanadium Prices, Business Strategy**

Largo has full leverage to the spot price of vanadium, which was demonstrated by their solid performance this quarter.  The company significantly increased revenues to $84.8 million from sales of 3,291 tonnes of V205; compared to 3,019 tonnes from the same period last year.

Largo has a 2-pillar business strategy – one consisting of a top-tier vanadium supplier, and two as an emerging clean energy business deploying Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries (VRFBs), for grid-level energy storage use.  Demand in these key markets have remained strong, reflected in the robust vanadium price this quarter.

The average benchmark price per lb. of V2O in Europe was $11.08 in Q2 2022, an increase of 35% from the average of $8.19 seen in Q2 2021.  Vanadium prices have decreased since the period, coinciding with a slowdown in consumption of the green metal in the steel sector.  Demand in the steel making process is the largest source of demand for vanadium, but Largo is working to diversify its industry weighting over time.

[Largo's lines of Business](https://preview.redd.it/ocmotmrlloi91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15fb4bc27589adad89523ee53a2a9c7d99638b1b)

On their recent earnings call, management shared that they’re experiencing a significant increase in demand from the aerospace chemicals and energy sectors.  Although these smaller sectors provide lower volumes, they require high purity products which sell for a premium price – Largo is uniquely positioned to be the supplier of choice for these markets.

Q1 2022 demand from the aerospace industry is more than 30% above Q1 2021.  V2O3 is demand is closely linked with high purity markets, so adding it to the Largo portfolio drives volumes, which drive premium margins.  As one of the only approved producers for the aerospace industry, Largo has a big opportunity to diversify while also increasing revenue and margins in the coming quarters.

So, despite a slowdown in the steel sector, the overall supply/demand dynamic provides strong support for a healthy vanadium market over the next decade.

**Future Revenue Opportunities** 

Q1 2022 demand from the aerospace industry is more than 30% above Q1 2021.  V2O3 is demand is closely linked with high purity markets, so adding it to the Largo portfolio drives volumes, which drive premium margins.  As one of the only approved producers for the aerospace industry, Largo has a big opportunity to diversify while also increasing revenue and margins in the coming quarters.

Overall Largo remains one of the most exciting companies playing in the green alloy and renewable energy sectors today. Largo produces a product with some of the strongest C02 emission reduction properties within steel as an alloy on the market and is truly thinking outside the box to push the adoption of vanadium-based technologies forward.

With a strong cash position, consistent share buybacks and expected cashflow generation based on future growth projects, Largo is well positioned to become a key holding for any fund or investor focused on a low carbon future."|0.75|2|0|2

Shares of the badly struggling retailer cratered 45% in pre-market trading on Friday as it was disclosed late Thursday Cohen's RC Ventures sold his entire position in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Cohen, who is also the chairman of GameStop, had about an 11.8% stake in the company.

Cohen's exit caps off an otherwise insane week of trading for a retailer not too far away from entering a grave alongside Sears, Kmart, Borders, and Circuit City.

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stock skyrocketed by nearly 70% in intraday trading on Tuesday as a result of a massive short squeeze. BBBY stock finished that session up 29% in a volatile day. From Tuesday's close to prior to Cohen's disclosure after Thursday's session, shares had gained another 17%.

Cohen initially disclosed a 9.8% stake in the company in March, and the recent resurgence of BBBY stock involved the meme community once again rallying together to counter institutional forces that hold opposing views on the stock and the underlying business.

On Monday, Yahoo Finance reported on signs of financial stress at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond locations in New York — and received colorful feedback from BBBY fans. On Tuesday, B Riley slashed its rating to Sell on Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Analysts at UBS and Wedbush also reiterated their sell ratings on the stock this week.

But with Cohen now out of the picture, the market may turn back to focusing on Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's bleak near-term outlook.

And, as we've previously reported, it's brutal.

After a failed push in 2021 and most of 2022 into stocking stores with private label goods no one had heard of while also closing stores and firing workers, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond ended its most recent quarter with a little more than $100 million in cash, tanking sales, weak store traffic, and a badly damaged brand.

There is currently an interim CEO running the business, which came about after the booting of former top Target exec Mark Tritton, and some observers are wondering whether vendors will continue to ship all of the merchandise that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond needs for the holiday season amid the retailer's severely weakened financial state.

t3_wsc2nx|1660910049|StockMarket|IIROC has clarified that naked short selling is not allowed|"[https://www.iiroc.ca/news-and-publications/notices-and-guidance/guidance-participant-obligations-have-reasonable-expectation-settle-any-trade-resulting-entry-short](https://www.iiroc.ca/news-and-publications/notices-and-guidance/guidance-participant-obligations-have-reasonable-expectation-settle-any-trade-resulting-entry-short)

**Guidance on Participant Obligations to have Reasonable Expectation to Settle any Trade Resulting from the Entry of a Short Sale Order**

# Executive Summary

This Guidance Note (**Notice**) provides guidance on the obligation of a Participant to have reasonable expectations, prior to the entry of a short sale order, that sufficient securities will be available to allow the Participant to settle any resulting trade on settlement date. This Notice confirms that the entry of a short sale order by a Participant without a reasonable expectation that they will have access to sufficient securities to settle any resulting trade on settlement date, which generally is two days following the trade date, is prohibited by UMIR 2.2 – Manipulative and Deceptive Activities.

**Definition of Short Sale**

A [short sale](https://www.iiroc.ca/rules-and-enforcement/umir-rules/11-definitions) is generally defined to mean the sale of a security which the seller does not own either directly or through an agent or trustee. For additional clarity, among other things, a seller is not considered to own a security (and any sale of such securities would be considered a short sale) where:

* the security held by the seller is subject to any restrictions on sale imposed by applicable securities legislation or by an Exchange as a condition of the listing of the security, or
* the settlement date or issuance date pursuant to:
   * an unconditional contract to purchase,
   * a tender of a security for conversion or exchange,
   * an exercise of an option, or
   * an exercise of a right or warrant

would, in the ordinary course, be after the date for settlement of the sale.

&amp;#x200B;

**Manipulative and Deceptive Activities**

Part 2 of Policy 2.2 enumerates a series of activities that may constitute a violation of UMIR 2.2(2) [1](https://www.iiroc.ca/news-and-publications/notices-and-guidance/guidance-participant-obligations-have-reasonable-expectation-settle-any-trade-resulting-entry-short#footnote1_hzed0or) . One of these activities is entering an order for the sale of a security without, at the time of entering the order, having the reasonable expectation of settling any trade that would result from the execution of the order. This includes short sale orders.

IIROC expects that prior to the entry of a short sale order a Participant has reasonable certainty that it can access sufficient securities for it to settle any resulting trade on settlement date, which generally is two days following the trade date. If the Participant knows or ought reasonably to know that it is unlikely that sufficient securities will be available and accessible to deliver on settlement date, the order is not permitted to be entered. For example, a Participant may not be able to demonstrate a reasonable expectation that sufficient shares would be available on settlement date in cases where:

* the person on behalf of whom the short sale order is entered has previously executed trades where shares were not available to deliver on settlement date, or
* the securities being sold short are difficult to borrow.

For added clarity, where a client expects to receive securities after the settlement date of a short sale trade, the Participant is not permitted to rely on those securities to establish a “reasonable expectation” to settle because the securities would not be available to deliver on the settlement date of the short sale trade.

&amp;#x200B;

**Frequently Asked Questions**

1. *I own securities that are subject to statutory resale restrictions that expire in 30 days. Can I rely on these securities to establish a “reasonable expectation” to settle a short sale where the settlement date will take place in two days?*

No. The definition of “short sale” considers a person who owns securities subject to statutory resale restrictions to be a short seller where the settlement date of a short sale takes place before the resale restrictions expire. Securities subject to a statutory restriction are not in an acceptable form to settle a short sale trade. Because the securities subject to a statutory hold will not be available to settle any resulting short sale trade on the settlement trade, this would not support a reasonable expectation to settle. In all instances, a Participant must have a reasonable expectation, prior to the entry of an order, that sufficient shares would be available and accessible to settle any resulting trade on settlement date. This may include arranging to borrow securities as appropriate.

1. *I have a client who subscribed to purchase shares of a secondary financing, but the financing has not yet closed. Can I rely on the client’s commitment to purchase shares off the financing as “reasonable expectation” to settle a short sale despite the closing date of the financing occurring after the settlement date of the short sale trade?*

No. Prior to the entry of a short sale order, a Participant must have a “reasonable expectation” that sufficient shares will be available to settle any resulting trade on settlement date. Because the financing will not have closed when the short sale trade is scheduled to settle, those shares will not be available on settlement date of the short sale trade.

* [1](https://www.iiroc.ca/news-and-publications/notices-and-guidance/guidance-participant-obligations-have-reasonable-expectation-settle-any-trade-resulting-entry-short#footnoteref1_hzed0or)UMIR 2.2 (2) - A Participant or Access Person shall not, directly or indirectly, enter an order or execute a trade on a marketplace if the Participant or Access Person knows or ought reasonably to know that the entry of the order or the execution of the trade will create or could reasonably be expected to create:  
1. a false or misleading appearance of trading activity in or interest in the purchase or sale of the security; or  
2. an artificial ask price, bid price or sale price for the security or a related security."|0.79|13|0|13

**Good Morning!**

I'm new here but excited to continue sharing insights alongside the great traders here!

Red start to the morning, markets are down -1% across the board.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

SPY 422-423 is a major level of support where we've fallen to this morning! Below that is 420 then 417. A break of 417 then all bets to the upside are done.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vd3tc7j9sni91.png?width=1228&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b868d71748a60ee1d3fc0e64c1b2e3006ea3883e

 

This morning I'm looking at the various Chinese names, namely BIDU to play a bounce.

 

https://preview.redd.it/uljzbusasni91.png?width=1228&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5162e5b3611031f6be4ebc2ef47fc36250edb37d

 

Lets see which camp they reward early in the morning. Most likely we should bounce off support for a retest of prior resistance levels at 425-426 then we make a decision to see if we make another leg down back to 420-422 on the SPY.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If that is not the case (less likely), then we just simply flush downward. Should be a very fun morning!"|0.75|6|0|6

One is **buying** stock...any stock for that matter. The second action is **holding** that stock. Holding until *what price*, you ask? Well, again...99.99999999% of those posts are either vague about that OR they put some outrageously high target that even a 5-year-old will laugh when hearing that number. Nowadays, most just say ""moon""...whatever the fuck that means.

In any event, why do you never post about selling a stock? I'm not talking about short selling! I'm talking about the basic ""buy low/sell high"" strategy that every single person in the stock market has learned about. If you bought STOCK G at $45 and posted that, you would get thousands of upvotes and everyone replying positively. A week later, you post that you sold STOCK G for $55, and you get downvoted and negative remarks. Why is this? You made a profit...isn't that the point?

Strangely, say STOCK G went down to $35 and you posted you sold for a loss. You'll get tons of people giving you their condolences or telling you that you were a weak hand and should have held or bought more. But nobody will get angry with you.

You sold at $55, people hate you. You sold at $35, people will not hate you. Someone please explain this. But more importantly, let's discuss why the concept of selling and the posting of that is taboo on most (if not all) message boards."|0.67|2|0|2

t3_wrrd89|1660848365|StockMarket|University student makes $110mn trading meme stock favourite Bed Bath &amp; Beyond|" The article below explains how an investor, Jake Freeman, purchased $27 million worth of Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY) stock at $5.50 per share.  


This equated to almost 5 million shares.  


Yesterday, BBBY opened at $26.94 and traded within a range of $30 and $22.50 before closing at $23.08. At this point the investor had an unrealized profit of $110 million.  


How does the investor manage the position now?  


The investor has the traditional options:  


1) Sell all  
2) Sell a portion  
3) Do nothing  


However, Subnani Investment Research, LLC advises that there is a 4th and more ""Savvy"" option than the above three. The 4th option would be to trade the stock's high volatility by entering into a covered call trade as follows:  


To recoup the cost basis in one attempt, the investor would've been advised to sell the at-the-money or roughly 25 strike call option trading between $13-$14 set to expire in January 2024.  


The investor's position of approximately 5,000,000 shares would've warranted the sale of 50,000 25-strike Jan calls at $1,300 per option for a total cash/premium inflow of $65m:  


50,000 x $1,300 = $65,000,000  


Either two scenarios can occur thereafter the sale.  


1) The stock rallies higher to $50, gets ""called away,"" and the investor receives an entire gain of $32.50 per share or $162.5m  


2) The stock falls beneath $5.50, the investor keeps the shares and a gain of $13 per share or $65m  


Regardless of stock direction, the investor keeps the $65m premium but has more upside potential in one outcome.  


Subnani Investment Research, LLC's investment process centers on performing the 4th option in a majority of it's firm's positions."|0.29|0|0|0

**SAN DIEGO / GLOBENEWSWIRE / August 18, 2022 / KULR Technology Group, Inc.** (NYSE American: KULR) (the “Company” or “KULR”), a leading developer of next-generation lithium-ion (“Li-ion”) battery safety and thermal management technologies, has received two orders from a leading Fortune 20 e-commerce and cloud computing company for its next generation Li-ion battery powered commercial drone delivery fleet. 

The first order was for the proof of concept of KULR’s design; the second follow-on order is for prototype, field testing and certification trials. Pre-production is scheduled for 2023 with full ramp-up set to start in the second half of 2024. These drones will feature improved safety and longer flight time. In March of this year McKinsey &amp; Company asserted, “As of early 2022, we estimate that more than 2,000 drone deliveries are occurring each day worldwide.

KULR’s VP of Sales and Marketing Greg Provenzano added, “This project dovetails nicely with our focus on specific high-growth markets where our differentiated products provide a design and production solution for safety and performance. Drone delivery is still in its early innings and e-commerce companies will only continue to implement this form of delivery logistics into their platforms as the commercial drone ecosystem continues to build out.”

According to a Form 144 that was signed and dated Tuesday and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, RC Ventures proposed selling 9.45 million shares of the company, which is the total amount it holds in Bed Bath. A Form 144 acts an official notice of a proposed security sale.

The aggregate purchase price of the 7.78 million shares directly owned by RC Ventures is roughly $119.4 million, excluding brokerage commissions, according to earlier SEC filings. And the aggregate purchase price of the firm's call options exercisable into 1.67 million shares owned directly by RC Ventures is about $1.8 million, also excluding those commissions.

Call options give a buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase stock at a set strike price. Cohen's options were for strike prices of $60, $75 and $80.

If Cohen hypothetically managed to sell all of his Bed Bath common stock at Wednesday's closing price of $23.08, he'd net about $60 million, according to a CNBC calculation. Cohen's hypothetical profits could may been larger if he also sold the options contracts.

Cohen first revealed he held a nearly 10% stake in Bed Bath through his activist firm in early March. FactSet says his holdings amounted to 11.82% as of late March.

At the time, Cohen, the GameStop chairman and founder of Chewy, wrote a letter to Bed Bath's then-CEO, Mark Tritton, saying he believed the home goods chain was struggling to reverse market share declines and navigate supply chain woes. He also urged the retailer to consider selling its Buybuy Baby chain.

Later in March, Bed Bath said it struck a deal with the activist's firm to add three people chosen by Cohen to its board of directors, effective immediately.

# [Stock futures tick higher as Wall Street tries to resume rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock market futures were slightly higher Thursday as investors tried to regain their footing a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped a five-day winning streak and a recent market rally appeared to fade.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow were 39 points higher, or 0.11%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.16% along with Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the Dow fell roughly 172 points, or 0.5%. The S&amp;P 500 declined 0.7% for its first negative session in four. The Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.25%. The tech-heavy index and S&amp;P 500 are now both on track to snap a four-week winning streak.
*****
&gt; Those moves came as traders parsed through the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting. The central bank remains committed to fighting inflation, but indicated it could adjust its pace of tightening based on market conditions.
*****
&gt; Investors have been hoping that the Fed might slow the pace of its rate hikes after July’s consumer price index reading showed inflation cooling slightly. But not everyone is convinced.
*****
&gt; “We’re in the camp that the Fed is not going to pivot,” Scott Wren, senior global market strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “The minutes didn’t make us change our mind at all. We think a 75 basis point hike is likely in September, and we’ll see more hikes at the end of the year ... we think the market is a little lofty right here,” he added.
*****
&gt; The latest batch of earnings report didn’t help traders’ sentiment during Wednesday’s session. Target’s quarter missed estimates, with results from Lowe’s coming in mixed.
*****
&gt; Some key economic data will also be released Thursday, including weekly jobless claims and existing home sales.

The market feels like it is climbing up a mountain. As it goes higher up, the steeper it becomes. And at the top it becomes completely vertical.  


**This implies 2 things:**

1: We are still climbing up the mountain (Momentum is bullish, becomes weaker as we get closer to the top and that is currently happening)

2: One slip can bring us tumbling back down (To major levels of support 417, 420, 422 SPY)  


&amp;#x200B;

The market popped and then faded the move upward from the FOMC minutes yesterday but as of 730am it seems like we will open flat/green.  


Always keep an open mind, follow the big money and history often does repeat itself. If it repeats itself once again it's only a matter of time before Mr. Market slips and falls down the mountain back to &lt;400 SPY."|0.78|5|0|5

I'm trying to explain that this is not a great option due to (1) virtually none of them beat the S&amp;P500, and (2) the cost of managing the money. She sees a fee of 1% and thinks it's no big deal. 

So let's operate on a couple assumptions here, namely that the advisor/manager is actually able to match SPY (average 10% annual growth) and that the fee is 1% of AUM. 

On the first year, that's a $5,000 management fee. She sees that as no big deal. But I see that $5k compounding at 10% for 30 years is $87.2k she won't have. Now, moving on. Let's say her account grew 10% over the year and the next year's fee is now $5,500. Over 30 years compounding at 10%, that would be $95.97k she doesn't get. Third year. Account now up to $605k, fee is now $6,050. Over 30 years that's $105.5k. And so on for 30 years. Sl

Is there a general guideline for the amount of experience in trading or amount of liquid capital to be approved for level 3 options trading? 

Context:

Until the last few years, I've really only maxed out my 401(k) that the employer matches and hadn't done much else. I also have a Roth IRA that I contribute to and use that as a self guided way to play around with higher volatility investments. About a month ago, I started reading about options trading and it got me interested. 

I blindly applied to be allowed to trade options through Merrill and read the 95 page doc that the OCC provided. I had applied for level 3 options trading because buying calls and puts was what I'd like to do, but didn't realize they look for previous experience and was then not shocked when my application was denied. 

So I am looking for some advice about getting into it and what targets I should be looking to meet prior to applying again. Is it worthwhile for me to apply for level 1 and start writing some covered calls to build up?

Musk, the world's richest person, said early on Wednesday that he hadn't been serious when he tweeted hours previously that he was going to buy Manchester United Plc (MANU.N), now languishing at the foot of the English Premier League as fed-up fans urge current owners, the American Glazer family to sell up.

""No, this is a long-running joke on Twitter. I'm not buying any sports teams,"" Musk posted when asked by a user if he was serious about buying the club when he had posted, ""I'm buying Manchester United ur (sic) welcome.""

# [Stock futures fall as Wall Street rally looks to take a breather after Dow’s 5-day winning streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell on Wednesday as a rally that has propelled equity prices higher since mid-June appeared poised for a respite.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 209 points, or 0.61%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.84% and 0.96%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Dow notched its fifth straight day of gains Tuesday. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 is going for its fifth positive week in a row as investors continue to gauge how much strength this rally has. The broad market index is now up 18% from its June lows.
*****
&gt; “This market has been so resilient,” Brynn Talkington, managing partner of Requisite Capital Management, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “As we’re coming to a close on earnings, earnings are going to beat by a median of about 7%.”
*****
&gt; Though giving her “a great deal of pause” in this market is the Federal Reserve and its plans to continue raising rates and shrink the size of its balance sheet. “Earnings have still been strong, but…the Fed balance sheet hasn’t budged,” she said.
*****
&gt; Traders on Wednesday were looking ahead to the release of U.S. retail sales data later in the morning. In the afternoon, the Federal Reserve is slated to release the minutes from its most recent meeting.
*****
&gt; Additionally, Wall Street has been poring through corporate earnings from the retail sector. Walmart and Home Depot reported Tuesday, while Lowe’s and Target posted earnings Wednesday morning.

I wanted to ask if anybody is investing in crypto using any ETF Indices (such as the ones run by S&amp;P)? I am considering investing a monthly amount in their S&amp;P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market Index ETF (SPCBDM) as it covers a variety of digital currencies and not just a few. Also, it is run by S&amp;P, so a much lower probability of some fraud or mismanagement of funds.

I am trying to replicate the best investment idea of index investing (best in terms of stress vs. the kind of returns) but in cryptos too.

What are your thoughts? And is anybody already investing in an ETF? What's your experience so far."|0.67|3|0|3

Basically if the Fed stays at an average below inflation by 3-4%, then real rates would be negative 3-4%, which means the nominal GDP will grow faster than the real GDP and something magical will happen…

**You know what’s that magical thing?**

&amp;#x200B;

Debt to GDP as a % will get lower! By keeping real rates negative, the Governments can work their way out of debt (and I personally think that would be more likely). Case in point is post World War II. High debt to GDP % was bought down by running negative real rates for a while."|0.63|2|0|2

The United States has caught itself in a debt trap. We have borrowed way too much money and the cost to service this debt has become unaffordable. [Here are the stats](https://invezz.com/stocks/debt-countries/)

To make matters worse The federal reserve has signaled a policy shift. It is ending its support of the financial markets.

The government will soon have to make some tough choices. We may be forced to cut government spending, probably raise taxes. And cut entitlement programs like social security.

This unfortunately is not limited to just the government. Corporate debt is also a major issue. The russel 300 has an estimated 772 zombie companies. (Companies only alive because of debt)

We are unfortunately not gonna get out of this without some pain. There is no such thing as free. And we have to realize we won’t have some of the things we are used to. Some companies will have to go bankrupt. Companies will have to be profitable. We will probably sustain heavy losses in the stock market.

How much do you think it will be trading by end of this week?|" Walmart on Tuesday said sales grew more than 8%, but profits tightened in the fiscal second quarter, as consumers turned to the discounter for groceries and essentials.

Shares rose more than 5% in early morning trading.

The retailer’s results surpassed analysts’ expectations, but echoed its profit warning last month, when Walmart said inflation-pinched shoppers were buying less high-margin discretionary merchandise like apparel as they spent more on necessities.

Walmart expects those spending patterns to persist. It reiterated its forecast for the back half of the year, even as it sells through a glut of inventory. It expects same-store sales for Walmart U.S. to grow by about 3%, excluding fuel, for the second half of the year, or about 4% for the full year. It anticipates adjusted earnings per share will decline between 9% and 11% for the full year.

“We expect inflation to continue to influence the choices that families make and we’re adjusting to that reality so we can help them more,” McMillon told analysts on a conference call.

Here’s what Walmart reported for the fiscal second quarter ended July 31, compared with Refinitiv consensus estimates:

Earnings per share: $1.77 adjusted vs. $1.62 expected

Revenue: $152.86 billion reported vs. $150.81 billion expected

Walmart’s net income for the quarter rose to $5.15 billion, or $1.88 per share, compared with $4.28 billion, or $1.52 per share a year earlier.

Same-store sales for Walmart U.S. grew 6.5% in the second quarter, excluding fuel, compared with the year-ago period. That was higher than the 5.9% growth that analysts expected, according to StreetAccount.

Dimon reportedly said on a client call Tuesday that the economy was ""strong"" but ""storm clouds"" were on the horizon, including federal monetary policies, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and rising oil prices. The categorization is an apparent downgrade from Dimon's previous comments in June when he warned of an ""economic hurricane.""

""Consumers' balance sheets are in good shape,"" he said, per the Yahoo report. ""Businesses are equally in good shape. When you forecast, you have to think differently. It is a bad mistake to say, 'Here is my single-point forecast.'

The CEO was said to have estimated the chances of a ""soft landing"" to be about 10% and the probability of a ""harder landing"" or ""mild recession"" to be closer to 20 to 30%. He also reportedly estimated a 20- to 30% chance of a ""harder recession"" and a 20- to 30% chance of ""something worse.""

Musk attorneys can interview 41 people who had access to bot information, known as “custodians” in court documents. However, 22 additional custodians will not be available to the defense’s lawyers.

On August 10, Bloomberg reported that Musk’s attorneys were accusing Twitter of hiding potentially key witnesses who were specifically responsible for evaluating the social media platform’s population of bots. The lawyers sent a letter to Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick that requested the names of those employees. Twitter had already handed over the names of 41 employees, including the General Manager of Consumer at Twitter, Kayvon Beykpour. However, they were not “as familiar with the data at issue.” Musk’s attorneys wanted 22 additional names, the letter on August 9 said.

However, McCormick ruled today that Twitter would not be required to release any information from the 22 “additional custodians:”

“Having reviewed the defendants’ letter dated August 9, 2022, and the plaintiff’s letter dated August 11, 2022, it is hereby ordered that the plaintiff is required to collect, review, and produce documents from Kayvon Keykpour. The plaintiff is not required to collect, review, or produce documents from any other of the defendants’ proposed 22 additional custodians. The plaintiff need only collect, review, and produce documents from the 41 custodians to which plaintiff has agreed to date and Mr. Beykpour.”

Crucially, Cohen also purchased 2023 call options on BBBY shares, with strike prices ranging between $60 and $80. For reference, the stock closed on Friday at $12.95 per share. While these bullish bets had appeared outlandish back in March, given the ongoing short squeeze in BBBY shares, it remains within the realm of the possible that Ryan Cohen’s call options enter the in-the-money territory. Even if that does not occur, any rally that takes the stock above $30 – which was the stock’s rough price level toward the end of March – will result in outsized gains for Cohen on the back of the increase in these options’ intrinsic value.

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were little changed Tuesday as traders weighed the earnings reports from two key retailers.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down just 6 points, or 0.02%. S&amp;P 500 futures slipped 0.6% along with Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
&gt; Walmart reported earnings per share that beat analyst expectations, sending the stock up 3%. The company also stuck with its second-half outlook. Home Depot reported earlier in the morning, with earnings beating expectations and the home-improvement store maintaining its 2022 guidance. Target and Lowe’s will report quarterly results Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, shares of ZipRecruiter slipped more than 5% after the company lowered its revenue outlook.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a solid session, with the major averages all rising Monday after a sharp intraday turnaround. The move higher built on the market’s rally off a June low.
*****
&gt; Still, some see the recent gains as a bear market rally instead of the start of a new bull cycle.
*****
&gt; “I think people are not being sensitive enough to this economic slowdown and what it’s going to mean for corporate earnings and profit margins,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said on CNBC’s “Fast Money.”

This would be huge for ALS suffers if Nurown gets FDA approval. I am a little confused though what happened to its stock price today. On Friday, the stock price spiked nearly 19% percent with the news of the erratum that was published. Then, on Monday morning, it spiked to $4.70 because of the BLA announcment. Then it gradually declined until it closed slightly below its opening price this morning.

* Q2 results were weaker than expected. Newmont’s EPS was 10% lower than expected due to lower production and higher cash costs amid inflationary pressures. Barrick’s EPS was 5% lower due to higher cash costs; production was in line.

* We are lowering our EPS and fair value estimates for both producers. 

&amp;#x200B;

* We are expecting a rally in gold prices in H2-2022 as the Fed is likely to take a less hawkish stance in its meeting next month due to weaker economic activities and GDP growth. Business activities in the U.S. contracted last month, indicating that job growth should slowdown in the coming weeks.

Semiconductors|"Acquisitions recently added a 100,000 sq/ft production facility and the potential to double revenues.

Good Day Everyone,

**EMCORE Corporation (NASDAQ: EMKR)** builds advanced optical semiconductors and systems that reside at the heart of today’s leading-edge aerospace &amp; defense platforms and highspeed communication networks.

Current price $2.88 (as of market close 8-12-22)

Last week was tumultuous for EMKR and its stakeholders. Last Tuesday the company shares were trading at $3.27. On Wednesday they released Q322 earnings, missing analysts’ expectations and announced the $55M cash acquisition of the Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG) and Inertial Navigation Systems business segment of KVH Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: KVHI).

The market responded to the revenue miss with a knee jerk reaction, driving the price to $2.45/share on Wednesday. After investors had a couple days of absorbing the news, the company’s shares moved to $2.88 by Friday. I wanted to report to you on EMKR because **I believe the stock may fill the gap created last week. Take a look at the chart (below) I see a potential gap fill at over $5.00/share.**

EMKR missed their Q3 (FYE is September 30) guidance of $25-27M in revenues, reporting $23M. I believe that EMKR, given the high-tech components used in their products, was particularly impacted by supply chain issues. Here is what the company had to say:

“During the three months ended June 30, 2022, unexpected delays and cancellations of key component deliveries required us to source critical components from alternative sources on short schedules and at increased prices, and a COVID-19 outbreak at the Company's Concord facility resulted in production delays and since our last call, the Cable TV business has become more turbulent, with a major customer deciding to exit CATV entirely.”

I’m looking at the bigger picture to guide me on EMKR. In FYE 2018 the company had $85M in revenues and built that up to $158M in FYE 2021 and this year the company has made some acquisitions. I believe the **market has not given the company the benefit of the value in its accretive acquisitions** and has placed too much focus on the narrow Q3 revenue miss.

**It’s my belief that two recent accretive acquisitions, one at the end of April and one last week could add $50M to the company’s annual top line.**

**Accretive acquisitions:**

EMKR just acquired the Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG) and Inertial Navigation Systems business segment of KVH Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: KVHI) for $55M in cash. EMKR reported $74.6M in cash at the end of Q3 on June30th. EMCORE acquired all the intellectual property and outstanding assets and liabilities of KVH’s FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems business segment, including the 100,384-square-foot production facility located in Tinley Park, Illinois. This new business from KVHI is generating over $30.0 million in revenue on an annual basis.

On April 29, 2022, EMKR completed the accretive acquisition of the L3Harris Technologies, Inc. Space and Navigation business for approximately $5.0 million. The acquisition brought Supplier agreement with L3Harris Space &amp; Sensors for the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas and Centaur launch vehicle, and existing products used for guidance on the international space station and classified reconnaissance platforms. In Q3, ended June 30sth EMKR reported $3.5M in partial quarter (2 month) revenues for the L3Harris segment. That could translate into annual revenues of $20M.

EKMR has an extensive product line and serves several industries with a blue-chip list of customers. As a part of your due diligence, I urge you to visit the company website at [emcore.com](https://mailchi.mp/broadstreetalerts/emcore.com), as well as looking at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugsI-RjxoZk) giving an overview of EMKR products and markets. Make no mistake, as you can see in the links, EMKR makes crucial components for the world’s most advanced aerospace, defense and communication systems.

**EMKR operates with two segments:**

**Aerospace and Defense** with two product lines: (1) Navigation and Inertial Sensing, and (2) Defense Optoelectronics. The company reports “Demand in our A&amp;D business segment is strong, and we expect our QMEMS operational issues to improve with a rebound in the September quarter.”

**Broadband** with three product lines: (1) CATV Lasers and Transmitters, (2) Chip Devices, and (3) Other Optical Products. The company reports “We began low volume shipments of data center chips as projected, signaling a new growth phase in Broadband.”

The addition of the new KVHI facility brings the number of production facilities operated by EMKR to four.

EMKR sees their Total Addressable Market at $2.7B and frankly, for much of their business, there isn't a lot of competition. I believe that is why EMKR has seen consistent growth (FYE 2022 may be an exception) and may see much higher revenues after this year’s accretive acquisitions.

**EMKR statistics:**

FYE September 30th, MRQ June 30,2022  
Outstanding shares        37.5M  
Shares in float                  30M  
Cash (mrq)                       $74.6M  
Book value (mrq)            $3.56/share  
Institutional ownership 69%

I note that in afterhours trading in last Friday’s session EMKR shares were at $2.95. I expect the short-term gap may fill quickly creating a momentum swing that could surpass the SMA 200 of $4.70/share.

See EMKR stockchart

EMCORE Corporation (taken from form 10-Q)  
EMKR is a leading provider of sensors for navigation in the aerospace and defense market as well as a manufacturer of lasers and optical subsystems for use in the broadband industry. We pioneered the linear fiber optic transmission technology that enabled the world’s first delivery of Cable TV directly on fiber, and today are a leading provider of advanced products that enable communications systems and service providers to meet growing demand for increased bandwidth and connectivity. The technology at the heart of our broadband communications products is shared with our fiber optic gyroscope (“FOG”) and inertial sensors to provide the aerospace and defense markets with state-of-the-art navigation systems technology. With the acquisitions of (a) Systron Donner Inertial, Inc. (“SDI”), a navigation systems provider with a scalable, chip-based platform for higher volume gyro applications utilizing quartz micro-electromechanical system (“QMEMS”) technology, in June 2019, and (b) the L3Harris Space and Navigation (“S&amp;N”) business in April 2022, we further expanded our portfolio of gyros and inertial sensors with SDI’s QMEMS gyro and accelerometer technology and S&amp;N's FOG and ring laser gyro (“RLG”) technology. We have fully vertically integrated manufacturing capability through our indium phosphide (“InP”) compound semiconductor wafer fabrication facility at our headquarters in Alhambra, CA and through our QMEMS processing and sensor manufacturing facility in Concord, CA, and our FOG and RLG manufacturing facility in Budd Lake, NJ. These facilities support our vertically integrated manufacturing strategy for QMEMS, FOG, and RLG products for navigation systems, and, with respect to our Alhambra, CA facility, for our chip, laser, transmitter, and receiver products for broadband applications. With both analog and digital circuits on multiple chips, or even a single chip, the value of Mixed-Signal device solutions is often substantially greater than traditional digital applications and requires a specialized expertise held by us which is unique in the optics industry.

More on EMKR coming soon,

Lucky

Burry's Scion Asset Management only held a $3.3 million stake in Geo Group, a new filing shows.

Scion owned $165 million of stocks at the end of March, excluding its Apple put options.

Michael Burry, the investor of ""The Big Short"" fame, slashed his US stock portfolio to a single holding in the second quarter, a SEC filing revealed on Monday.

Burry's Scion Asset Management disclosed just over 500,000 shares of Geo Group worth $3.3 million. Geo invests in private prisons and mental health facilities, and commands a market capitalization of less than $900 million.

Close followers of Burry are likely to interpret his decision to effectively liquidate his portfolio as a bad omen. The hedge fund manager diagnosed the ""greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things"" last summer, and warned owners of meme stocks and cryptocurrencies that they were careening towards the ""mother of all crashes.""

More recently, he has cautioned investors not to get too excited about the recent rally in stocks, as previous downturns have seen lots of temporary rebounds before finding a bottom.

Scion's portfolio comprised 11 stocks worth $165 million at the end of March, excluding bearish put options it held against 206,000 Apple shares.

The Scion chief has taken a knife to his portfolio in the past. He pared it from 20 holdings to six in the third quarter of last year, reducing its value from $140 million to $42 million in the space of three months.

Burry shot to fame after his billion-dollar wager against the mid-2000s housing bubble was chronicled in the book and the movie ""The Big Short."" He's also known for betting against Elon Musk's Tesla and Cathie Wood's Ark Innovation fund last year, and for investing in GameStop before it became a meme stock.

2021 was the busiest year for deals since 2000, with a record-breaking IPO rush of 1,035 listings in the US, with the biotech and healthcare sectors leading the way, accounting for 36% of all IPO activity.

While most investors are busy reviewing stocks in their current portfolio, it may come as a surprise which company came in first for stock return. Although it is currently not a household name, any savvy investor should keep this stock on their radar: Regencell Bioscience (NASDAQ:[RGC](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/RGC#NASDAQ)). RGC is the top performing stock of all 2021 IPOs according to stockanalysis.com/ipos/2021/. As of August 1, 2022, RGC is still ranked #1 with a 237% return above its IPO price of $9.50.

[A June 2022 article](https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/22/06/27567868/traders-may-keep-hunting-for-another-squeezable-stock-like-gamestop-how-does-this-tickers-short-i) mentioned that RGC’s total cumulative short volume is over 19 million shares. While the stock has suffered from short sellers’ attacks since its listing, RGC has performed well. RGC has approximately 2.6 million tradable ordinary shares in the market and has maintained a low float as the founder and CEO has repeatedly purchased RGC ordinary shares from the open market. 

RGC’s Solid Foundation

As mentioned above, RGC is closely held by the CEO who owns over 81% of the company. He has used $5.9 million of his personal funds to purchase RGC shares from the open market since its IPO.

His consistent share purchases convey his confidence, commitment and conviction in the company and is putting his money where his mouth is. There are few companies that  have the CEO owning this much of the business.

In a tweet on Sunday, Musk said, ""Congrats Giga Shanghai on making millionth car! Total Teslas made now over 3M.""
The Shanghai factory, which was opened in 2018, crossed the milestone despite temporary shutdowns due to resurgence of COVID-19 restrictions and parts shortages that threatened Tesla's vehicle production. 
Shanghai factory is Tesla's first Gigafactory outside the United States, while Giga Berlin is the first Tesla factory in Europe. The company also has car factories in Fremont, California; and Austin, Texas.
Musk announced recently that Tesla's factory in Fremont, California, its very first car factory, produced its 2 millionth vehicle.
In a June interview, Musk had referred its new car factories in Texas and Berlin to as money furnaces, noting that they were losing billions of dollars as supply chain disruptions affect the electric vehicle giant's ability to ramp up production.
He then had said getting Berlin and Austin functional and getting Shanghai back in the saddle fully were overwhelmingly their concerns.
In its latest second quarter, the company produced over 258,000 vehicles and delivered over 254,000 vehicles, a 26.5 percent increase from last year, despite ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns. Tesla said June 2022 was the highest vehicle production month in its history.
Earlier this year, Tesla had announced plans to increase vehicle deliveries by 50 percent annually.
Musk recently said the company intends to reduce Tesla's salaried workforce by 10 percent in the next three months, but to increase the number of hourly employees. Tesla's layoffs would affect 3.5 percent of the total workforce.
Last week, Musk had sold around 7.9 million shares of Tesla worth around $6.88 billion to avoid an emergency sale of its stock in the event of a forceful Twitter deal. He is facing a legal battle for his intended withdrawal from planned $44 billion acquisition of the social media platform."|0.67|2|0|2

# [Stock futures fall on slowing China economy concern, following 4 straight weeks of S&amp;P gains](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/14/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. equity futures were lower Monday, putting Wall Street on track to take a breather after another positive week, as traders braced for big retail earnings.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 149 points, or 0.44%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.5% each.
*****
&gt; Monday’s moves come after disappointing economic data out of China overnight. The country’s central bank also cut rates unexpectedly, raising concern over China’s economic recovery.
*****
&gt; “The clouds of recession are gathering globally. The Chinese economy contracted in 2Q. The US notched a “technical recession.” The flow of natural gas to Western Europe is restricted. In the past three months, we have revised down our forecast for global growth to 2.5%Y in 2022, which is about 50bp below consensus and 40bp lower than in May. We are edging closer to the bear scenario from our May Mid-year Outlook,” wrote Morgan Stanley’s Seth Carpenter in a note to clients Sunday.
*****
&gt; Last week the S&amp;P 500 advanced 3.25% to notch its fourth positive week in a row and its longest winning streak since 2021. The Nasdaq Composite ended the week 3.08% higher, also for its fourth straight week. The Dow added 2.9%.
*****
&gt; The gains came after economic data showed inflation pressures could be easing a bit. The consumer price index was flat from June to July, the producer price index showed a surprise decline and import prices fell more than expected.
*****
&gt; That helped relax investors that have been eager to call the mid-June lows the bottom of the cycle. Just as many have been quick to call out that the data from one month doesn’t necessarily make it a reliable trend.
*****
&gt; Investors are looking ahead to a week of earnings from big retailers including Home Depot, Walmart and Target, and listening for clues on how their businesses have been affected by inflation and other macro challenges in the most recent quarter.
*****
&gt; Retail sales data is also scheduled to be released this week.

Some investors are starting to believe the worst of this year’s rout might be behind them. Data last week showed gauges of both consumer and producer prices [falling in July](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-july-2022-consumer-price-index-11660077986?mod=article_inline), offering some hope that inflation might be [at or close to a peak](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-definition-cause-what-is-it-11644353564?mod=article_inline). 

The labor market also [remains robust](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/july-jobs-report-unemployment-rate-economy-growth-2022-11659646690?mod=article_inline). Employers added more than half a million jobs in July, while the unemployment rate ticked down to close to a half-century low—hardly things investors would expect to see if the economy were in or on [the brink of a recession](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-this-is-a-recession-we-might-not-know-for-months-11659173402?mod=article_inline).📷

On the flip side, the Federal Reserve [isn’t done raising interest rates](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-raises-interest-rates-by-0-75-percentage-point-11658944935?mod=article_inline), leaving richly valued parts of the market vulnerable.Much of what has surged the past several weeks is precisely what led the market lower during its punishing selloff in the first half of the year. [Meme stocks](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/peloton-rivian-amc-gamestop-stock-market-psychology-11660250193?mod=article_inline) such as [AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC). and [Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BBBY). have climbed 107% and 111%, respectively, since markets bottomed for the year on June 16. Shares of cryptocurrency-related companies such as [Coinbase Global Inc](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/COIN). and triple-leveraged exchange-traded funds tracking the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index have also soared.

The S&amp;P 500 is up 17% over the same period but remains down 10% for the year. With inflation remaining near multiyear highs, some investors worry parts of the market are in for another punishing selloff, especially if the Fed has to raise interest rates for longer than expected. When interest rates were at historic lows, investors got big returns from piling into shares of richly valued, often unprofitable companies.

The fact that bond yields were so low made even the riskiest stocks—as well as other investments, like cryptocurrencies—look like an attractive proposition for many investors. Rising rates reverse that dynamic.“I can’t argue that this pace \[of market gains\] is going to continue,” said Nancy Tengler,chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments. “Whether we are in recession now or are going to be in one in the third or fourth quarter, you know economic growth is going to slow.”That means it is prudent to be even more selective about what types of companies the firm is putting money into, she said.📷

One factor that has clouded investors’ outlook is debate over how far into the future the Fed will have to keep raising interest rates.Since the Fed’s July policy meeting, some investors have bet [the central bank will pivot](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-bet-fed-will-need-to-cut-interest-rates-next-year-to-bolster-the-economy-11658694486?mod=article_inline) from raising interest rates to lowering them next year to boost economic activity again. That has helped spark a rebound in not just stock but also bond prices.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which falls as bond prices rise, fell to 2.848% Friday, down from its mid-June peak of 3.482%.📷

Skeptics, however, warn that it might be too early to assume that the Fed will change tacks in 2023. July’s CPI and PPI readings were good news for the markets. And they certainly gave wind to the idea that the Fed will raise interest rates by half a point at its September meeting, instead of three-quarters of a point as initially expected.📷

But just one or two lower inflation readings won’t suffice in convincing the Fed that inflation is dissipating, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. Some factors driving inflation higher have also yet to ease. Last week’s CPI report showed grocery prices rose 13.1% in July from a year ago, the fastest pace since 1979. Housing prices [also increased](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-housing-affordability-in-june-was-the-worst-since-1989-11660312801?mod=article_inline). 

Given the way the Fed typically likes to see [multiple consecutive economic readings](https://archive.is/o/DRNCC/https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-michelle-bowman-says-large-interest-rate-rises-could-continue-11659802500?mod=article_inline) before changing tack on policy, markets might be running ahead of themselves, Mr. Colas said.Many investors are skeptical the recent rebound in more speculative investments will shake out differently this time."|0.54|1|0|1
t3_wo6w6b|1660485123|StockMarket|High ROE but low Profit Growth over long periods?|"Hi,

Can anyone please explain to me that how exactly is it possible for a company to have a relatively very high ROE but low Profit Growth over long periods, when it's Dividend Payout Ratio is less than 50%?

Take the example of Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders(https://www.screener.in/company/MAZDOCK/). Look at the bottom of the Profit &amp; Loss section in the page and you will find Compounded Profit Growth of 2% over 5 Years but average ROE of 19% over the same period.

It seems to me that that could only happen if the book value of the company is decreasing or not growing as it should be in accordance with the Profits. And it seems that that is probably the case here. Look at the Book Value in the Balance Sheet from Mar2017(Financial Year in India ends on 31st March) onwards and you will get the idea.

If I am right, then thing I am not getting is that how or why the Book Value is decreasing or staying stagnant? Where have all the profits(after deducting Dividend Payouts) gone/vanished??!

My name is Ramtin and I am one of the founders of Bavest ([www.bavest.co](https://www.bavest.co/)).

I started investing during my studies.

In  the process, the following bugged me: When you do stock picking,  financial data is scattered on many sites. Then there are various  websites and apps with tools, such as Stockscreener. In other apps I can  track my portfolio.

Which was quite annoying to me because you had to switch between many websites and apps.

I  thought to myself that this should be better, that you should have  everything in one place: real-time data, financial data, portfolio  tracking, benchmarking, tools like Aktienscreeer, comparison tools,  sentiment data, create watchlists and share them with others, etc. We  want to solve this problem with Bavest. We already have the above  features and some more in the platform.

The platform is still completely free - many of you probably have this problem.

We  need your help: this platform is also built for you, feel free to give  us feedback, ideas or suggestions on what could be done better and also  what other tools you need to make your investment process easier.

Basically I hold large positions Aston Martin and Palantir, and it's weighing down the gains on my portfolio. If I sell, I wipe out 40% of my gains over the last 2 years. If I hold, I continue the risk of just loosing more money, after being roughly 50 - 60% down already on both positions. 

I'm fully prepared to hold for the next 5 - 10 years and DCA every month, but is it worth it? Or should I just sell both positions, and invest in something I think is more profitable/better long term. 

I think Palantir might turn around in the next 5 - 10 years, but I have my doubts about Aston Martin. Both were terrible investments in hindsight.

It operates in the United States, Asia, Mexico, Europe, Africa, India, and the Middle East. The company was founded in 1968 and is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona.  


Although their revenue decreased 1.41% to $452.4m compared to last year's quarter - their net losses improved by 86.2% in the same timeframe with a loss of ($6m).   


As a result, their net margin loss improved from (8.7%) to (1.2%), hovering just below the breakeven threshold.  


TPI Composites has been consistently growing its revenue and has a yearly growth streak of four years since FY17. The company has also been previously profitable in FY17 and FY18, having achieved a small net income of $39m and $5.28m, respectively - before net losses began in FY19 onwards.    


In the short term, the current assets and current liabilities can measure a company's ability to pay short-term debt or obligations due within one year. TPI Composite's short-term liquidity percentage in Q2 was 69.6% (current liabilities/current assets) - which represents unfavourably high levels of short-term liabilities. Current assets and current liabilities were $620m and $431m, respectively.   


However, compared to last year's quarter current assets were actually up 11.2%, while current liabilities decreased by 1.7%. Last year's short-term liquidity percentage was 78.7%.  


Investors should still note that only nine months ago, current liabilities had actually become higher than their current assets. All eyes will be on whether this year's Q3 can avoid the same problem occurring again and ensuring this isn't a cyclical financial strain.   


In the long-term, total assets for Q2 climbed 4.4% to $982m from levels one year ago - while total liabilities decreased by 1.8% to $431m.  This actually represented a much more controlled long-term liquidity of 43.9% than compared with short-term, as well as improving from last year's 46.7%  - however, with uncertainty around where interest rates are heading, companies should be aiming to continue improving their liquidity.     


Total cash levels have actually increased 26% since last year to $155m, slightly relieving investor fears of the company increasing debt or potential share dilution if cash was urgently needed. To have increased total assets and total cash, while decreasing total liabilities simultaneously is a remarkable achievement (if it doesn't reverse).   


 TPI Composites release its Q3 earnings for the year on approximately 07 November, 2022.

Shares of the company surged about 11% in afternoon trade after the company said in a memo it would cut about 800 jobs and reduce its retail presence in North America. Under Chief Executive Officer Barry McCarthy, Peloton has implemented a slew of measures including cost cuts to steady its business as a pandemic-driven demand for its treadmills and exercise bikes quickly fizzles. On Friday, the company outlined a plan to aggressively reduce its retail presence in the United States and eliminate a number of jobs in warehouses and customer support teams.

t3_wnahbh|1660383363|StockMarket|I was correct about predicting inflation peaking and market bottom in June. Now I think there are 3 threats to economy and markets.|"Recent 2 weeks’ declining inflation data and climbing jobless claims in US warranted my previous 2 posts in June that the inflation had peaked and economy started to shrink, and, the market has passed its bottom. 

If you haven’t seen my previous posts and don’t believe I’ve said above, pls check my previous posts in Reddit via the links. 

&lt;https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/v4d3fv/recent\_economic\_news\_and\_data\_i\_think\_would\_make/ &gt;

&lt;https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wbnxe1/told\_you\_the\_inflation\_was\_about\_peaking\_last/ &gt;

I’ve pretty confident the market has already passed the bottom though there could be small pullbacks, but I don’t think there would be anything worse than the June bottom **UNLESS the following 3 threats become real.** 

What I’m worried about are following 3 potential threats to our current economy and markets:

1. Fed’s misjudgment on continuous strong hikes. 

2. Risks on financial institutions in Wall Street have strong financial links with Chinese property and financial sectors.

3. Potential war in next 5 years. 

Let me explain each one:

**Threat 1: Fed’s misjudgment on continuous strong hikes.** 

Not saying small hikes are bad, but continuous strong hikes would be a time bomb. 

Why I think Fed will misjudge the situation and continue to hike strongly is a bomb. Well they had no idea how much credit leveraged in 2008 GFC and I don’t expect they now had a clear picture after printing trillions of $ and decades of economic expansion.

Here is a new word I’ve invented called “Political Inertia”. Policy makers tended to trapped by their own initiatives or political agenda, they tended to slowly make a significant adjustment on their predeclared targets. Why? It’s all due to the fact they lack of instant feedbacks and incentives also, they have to persuaded their fellows with various thoughts. For instance, the US Fed, European Central Bank, AU RBA etc. all made wrong judgement about QE at the mid of 2020, all made wrong claims about the inflation was transitory and all reacted slowly about the high inflation because it would be a humiliation for themselves to make a sudden “U turn” on policies once they’ve declared their initial thoughts. Now they Face the consequences. Likewise, Biden administration also made an incorrect judgment about green energy policy (not saying it’s bad for earth) and reduced own domestic energy supply, which made him in 2 years later and right before the mid election himself had to fly to Saudi and asking OPEC for help. This is all the evidence of what I call “Political Inertia”. Sooner or latterly, Fed would find they had hiked too much and hurt the economy. But I won’t blamed them as the economy is so massive and they only rely on lagging indicators as I’ve mentioned in my previous posts. 

**Threat 2: Risks on financial institutions in Wall Street has strong financial links with (or investments in) Chinese property and financial sectors.**

Don’t know if you’ve followed the news, but let me explain. 

Chinese economy is so massive and so entangled with whole world economy. If there is something big happening to Chinese economy, it would be chain reactions to the rest of the world just like the 2008 GFC. And in fact, I’m discussing the GFC might happened again though a smaller scale than 2008’s (I hope) as it’s also stem from the property market. Property sector contributed 15% GDP in China. And the whole Chinese economy is shrinking much like 1990’s Japan crisis. Now there are massive defaults on Chinese property loans and remember such loans have derivatives. Though some analysts argue that China doesn’t have the same extent levels of derivatives as that in US, I would disagree with this as they may underestimated the “shadow banks” in China and they are the real derivatives and often invisible in accounting, many Chinese developers (small to mid size) borrowed money from shadow banks rather form real banks, this is typical in emerging countries. Additionally, many Chinese banks now restricted savers to withdraw money. These are all signs of incoming crisis. 

What I’m really concerned about is how much Wall Street had in terms of the financial links with these Chinese property developers and banks. I know BlackRock and Bridgewater and other some big Wall Street institutions had huge investments in China but just don’t know exactly how much. Now China’s one of the biggest developers Evergrande has technically bankrupted, it’s just hung in there for government’s bailout. BlackRock Inc., UBS Group AG and Allianz SE etc have all reported holding Evergrande debts. Whereas, Chinese government has experienced shortage of revenue due to its zero COVID policy and slowdown on economy (19% youth unemployment rate). The Wall Street told public that they had less links with those troubled developers but the question is do you believe them. History already told us the answer. 

**Threat 3: Potential war in next 5 years.** 

CCP is not ready to start a war with Taiwan and US in this year, but would be extremely likely in next 5 years. This is rather complicated and it deserves a whole new post, which please have a read via the link if you are interested. &lt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wnah0e/why\_im\_thinking\_ccp\_is\_not\_going\_to\_start\_a\_war/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wnah0e/why_im_thinking_ccp_is_not_going_to_start_a_war/)\&gt;"|0.41|0|0|0

should I only keep my biggest losers and wait for them to turn around and sell near a break even price or by doing so I'm just making my protfolio shittier by selling all the best and keeping just the shit?

*****
&gt; Stocks rose sharply on Friday, clinching the fourth straight positive week for the S&amp;P 500 as investors celebrated signs that inflation may be peaking.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 424.38 points, or 1.27%, to close at 33,761.05. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.73% to finish at 4,280.15, and the Nasdaq Composite surged 2.09% to 13,047.19.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rose 3.26% on the week, notching its longest weekly winning streak since November 2021. The Dow was up 2.92% for the week, while the Nasdaq Composite moved higher by 3.08%. For the Nasdaq, it was also the fourth positive week in a row.
*****
&gt; The averages have been boosted by positive news on the inflation front. The consumer price index was flat from June to July, thanks in large part to falling gas prices, which lowered headline inflation. The producer price index showed a surprise decline. On Friday, import prices also fell more than expected.
*****
&gt; This week’s moves have extended a market rally off its mid-June lows. The S&amp;P 500 has gained 16.7% since the lows, and has cut its losses from the peak in half. The Dow had gained nearly 13% and the Nasdaq Composite has rebounded 22.6%.
*****
&gt; The positive news has bolstered investor confidence, leading some to believe that the recent gains are more than a typical bear market rally.
*****
&gt; “We are not arguing that the market will make new highs this year (we are more in the trading range camp), but we would not be surprised to see a run toward the highs as inflation eases and the Fed slows the pace of rate hikes,” Michael Darda, chief economist and market strategist at MKM Partners, said in a note.

&gt; # VIX and Volatility Have Historically Increased August through October

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/68b1e7f12dc8ccdadd077b69e5bd7c7a/17946972bd670247-1d/s500x750/14cedaf89a9fd48dad4f61e19abee9bc8415ae56.jpg))**

&gt; Historically speaking, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) tends to reach its seasonal low in late-July or early August and slowly begin climbing towards its seasonal high, usually in the month of October. This may be due to the fact that the two worst performing months of the year, August and September (by average performance) precede it. VIX’s seasonal pattern can be seen in the following chart.

&gt; October’s volatility peak is also visible when closing daily percent changes are analyzed. October has hosted the most daily moves in excess of 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 7% and even 10% since 1930. Do not fret over the ten times S&amp;P 500 has moved more than 10% in a single day. Six of the ten occurrences were way back in the 1930’s. Only four have occurred more recently and out of those, two were actually positive days (10/13/2008 +11.58% and 10/28/2008 +10.79%). Only three of the ten days with moves in excess of 10% were negative days: 3/18/1935 –10.06%, 10/19/1987 –20.47% and 3/16/2020 –11.98%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c97cdfde9fdb3ead4650f09a5bfeeadc/17946972bd670247-31/s500x750/d7fc2cba796719dd3d486147337a13ab3fbffb73.jpg))**

&gt; Putting all but the +/-1% moves table data into a bar chart adds a quick confirmation of October’s heightened volatility versus all other months. Volatility’s trend can also be observed as the frequency of sizable daily moves tends to decline from March through July then an increase in August lasting until October.

&gt; # High Short Interest Revival

&gt; As we detailed in last night's Closer, whatever name that it might be given—meme stocks, yolo trades, or ""stonks""—there has been a trend recently in which there has been strong performance of highly volatile names loved by the most risk tolerant retail investor. That is roughly a year and a half to the day of the meme stock mania where highly shorted names saw massive short squeezes driven by the retail community.

&gt; Since the mid-June lows, highly shorted names have again been outperforming. Below we show the chart of an index covering the 100 most highly shorted stocks going back to early 2020. The vast majority of 2020 gains have been erased, however, this index has also risen 46% since its June 16th low (the same date as the broader market's low). On a relative basis, the most heavily shorted stocks have been outperforming the Russell 3,000 in that time resulting in the relative strength line to break out of the downtrend that has been in place since the peak of the meme stock mania in late January of last year. That being said, the index itself has much further to go in order to break out of its downtrend off of that high in price.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081022-SIPF-1.png))**

&gt; Below we show the stocks within the Russell 3,000 that currently have the highest levels of short interest as of the end of July. The only stock with more than 50% of its float sold short is Torrid Holdings (CURV). The next highest is a company that frequently finds itself high up on the list of highly shorted stocks: Dillard's (DDS). While those readings are elevated, they are well below what had been the most heavily shorted stock a month and a half ago. As of the mid-June update, Redbox (RDBX) had an extremely elevated reading on short interest that was closing in on 100%. Today that reading has collapsed back down to a still elevated but less extreme 41.5%. We would also note, however, that RDBX is a messy story at the moment in the midst of an acquisition (confirmed to go through in the past 24 hours) with the potential to save the company from bankruptcy.

&gt; Other notables on the list of most heavily shorted stocks include grill-maker Weber (WEBR), Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY), Upstart (UPST), Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV), Beyond Meat (BYND), Groupon (GRPN), and Nikola (NKLA).

&gt; Below is a look at price charts for most of the heavily shorted stocks listed in the table above. While many of these names are up huge since mid-June, the gains hardly register on six-month charts because they got hit so hard in the first half of the year.

&gt; # The Nature of Risk

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2e7c24f3af99c0197abcfb74fd392c6c/e2f796e9605c0091-8f/s500x750/d2cc94d79f2dab634b5a2cb53aa808454c4d29f0.jpg))**

&gt; Here is a little sneak peek into the 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac from Justin Mamis’ The Nature of Risk that is remarkably apropos now. 2022 continues to track this Sentiment Cycle rather closely.

&gt; Just before we presented at the CMT Association’s 2022 Annual Symposium veteran technical analyst Helene Meisler shared Mamis’ Sentiment Cycle along with her analysis of where in the cycle the market was at the time at the end of April 2022—in that brief pause between disbelief and panic (green circle).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f7776586866f6c633e54944732814347/e2f796e9605c0091-7e/s500x750/5179db6b975ce431bbac4c5ce8484a90afacdd84.jpg))**

&gt; Comparing the current chart of the S&amp;P 500 below we’ve highlighted in yellow that area of disbelief Ms. Meisler pointed out in April. The June low correlates quite well with Panic and we are now hitting the first level of Anxiety.

&gt; This dovetails with our seasonal/cycle outlook for a lower low or retest of the lows over the next three months as we are in the worst two months of the year and are smack dab in the “Weak Spot” of the 4-Year Cycle from Q2 to Q3 of the midterm election year, which sets up the Sweet Spot and the Quadrennial Rally.

&gt; We will know more tomorrow after the big CPI report comes out. If CPI cools considerably that would suggest we have passed the Panic point and are on the other side of Discouragement and climbing the Wall of Worry toward Anxiety before a higher low at Aversion.

&gt; # Inflation Still Top Of Mind for Small Business

&gt; While fewer respondents to this month's NFIB small business survey reported that they observed higher prices, inflation continues to be a front and center concern. The percentage of respondents reporting inflation as their biggest problem has risen further to another record high of 37%. That completely erased June's drop down to 34%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080922-NFIB-MIP-1a.png))**

&gt; While broad inflation is currently the most pressing problem, other inflation-related measures also rose in July. The percentage of firms reporting cost of labor as their single most important problem rose to 9%, although that is still below the record high reading of 13% at the end of last year.

&gt; While we often combine that reading with the percentage of responses reporting quality of labor as the biggest issue as a gauge of labor market health, the latter problem dropped 2 percentage points to net out the rise in cost of labor. On a combined basis, these two concerns are now tied with March at 30% for the lowest level since January 2021 (28%).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/080922-NFIB-MIP-1.png))**

&gt; One other combined reading that we often check in on is the percentage of respondents reporting government requirements or taxes as their biggest issues. Over the past few decades, Republican administrations have usually coincided with lower readings whereas Democrat administrations would see a higher reading. With inflation concerns surging this year, a historically low share of businesses are concerned about government action. The combined reading fell to another record low of 16% in July with the entirety of that drop on account of a 3 percentage point decline in government requirements and red tape.

&gt; # Risk of Default Declining

&gt; We like to use credit default swaps (a product that pays out investors if a reference company defaults) to track risk premiums in the corporate bond market. When risk premiums rise, credit default swaps get more expensive, and the spread implied between risk free rates and CDS rises.

&gt; As recession fears intensified throughout the first half of 2022, both the investment grade and high yield credit default swap indices skyrocketed, gaining 106.7% and 110.5% between the start of the year and the highs, respectively. However, earnings were not as bad as feared, economic data is starting to come in better than expected, gas prices have fallen, and CPI seems to have peaked in June. All of this has caused substantial declines in CDS index spreads, with the risk premium associated with each falling by about a quarter since their summer peak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/CDX-IG-2-081122.jpg))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/CDX-HY-081122.jpg))**

&gt; Although CDX High Yield's spread is well off of its highs, it is still above the average over the last ten years, implying a still elevated risk related to recession and potential defaults. We can also tie CDS indices to the performance of actual corporate bonds. The option-adjusted spread (a proxy for the credit risk over risk-free rates for a given investment) for high yield bonds in the ""cash"" market has a 0.88 correlation to CDS over the past decade. Notably, the CDX HY spread remains above its long-term average, while that High Yield Average OAS is below its average, implying investors may be getting under-compensated for the risk they are taking in the high yield debt market.

&gt; # Normalizing Sentiment

&gt; Sentiment has continued to head back towards more normal levels as equities press higher. The latest reading from the AAII on the percentage of investors that are bullish on the S&amp;P 500 over the next six months reached the highest level since March. At 32.2%, bullish sentiment is now only 5.5% below the historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081122-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The reading on bearish sentiment meanwhile has dropped to 36.7% which is also the lowest reading since the end of March; the last time this reading was below 30%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081122-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Although both bullish and bearish sentiment are closing in on one another, bears continue to outnumber bulls. The bull-bear spread rose to -4.5 this week extending the streak of negative readings to 19 weeks long. At the moment, that is the third longest streak on record and would need to continue for at least three weeks more to tie the second-longest streak on record of 22 weeks ending in December 1990.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081122-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; While the bull-bear spread remains negative for the AAII survey, other sentiment surveys have been showing more bullish sentiment. The Investors Intelligence survey has had a positive bull-bear spread for three weeks in a row now, and the NAAIM exposure index has shown investment managers have been quick to add exposure to equities in recent weeks. Standardizing these three survey results (measuring each one in how many standard deviations from the long-term average they are), the NAAIM and Investors Intelligence surveys are now back into positive territory. In other words, these two surveys are actually showing sentiment as having moved slightly above what has been the historical norm. Meanwhile, the AAII reading is far more negative even if it is trending higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/081122-AAII-5.png))**

&gt; Additionally, those are the first positive readings in some time. For the NAAIM index, the z-score has not seen a positive reading in 15 weeks. That is the longest stretch without a positive reading since the first quarter of 2016 and prior to that, there have only been a handful of other streaks that have gone on as long. For the Investors Intelligence survey, it was an even rarer streak ending at 29 weeks long. That was the longest since one that went on for roughly a year and ended in May 2009. Prior to that, you would have to go all the way back to 1995 to find a longer streak.

&gt; Then there are the AAII results. Still going at 32 weeks long, the z-score has only been negative for as many consecutive weeks once in the survey's history, and that was during 2020. All of this is to say that the AAII survey has been leaning more pessimistically than other surveys even as overall sentiment has largely made its way back to historically normal levels.

t3_wmw7lm|1660338933|StockMarket|ESS Tech (iron flow batteries) post first revenue in Q2 and improved net losses - short-term and long-term liquidity improves|"ESS Tech (NYSE: GWH) is an energy storage company, designing and producing long-duration batteries using earth-abundant materials. Its batteries provide flexibility to grid operators and energy assurance for commercial and industrial customers. Its technology addresses energy delivery, duration, and cycle-life in a single battery platform that compares favourably to lithium-ion batteries. The company was founded in 2011 and is headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon.

ESS Tech reported their Q2 for the year (ending 30 June) on 11 August and for the first time since being founded they reported a revenue - amounting to $680,000 and a landmark moment for the company.  Their share value increased by more than 18% during subsequent daily trading.

Investors should still note the net loss of ($15.6m), significantly higher than their revenue - representing a net margin loss of 2,294%. Net losses in recent quarters have been as high as ($180m). Investors could be betting that the net margin loss will improve ahead of a landmark moment for renewable energy in the US.

If signed into law, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) would allocate $369bn to households and businesses to solely invest in renewable energy sources – a historic amount that scientists estimate will lead to carbon reductions of 40% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels - as well as positively impacting climate-related equity investments.

The first thing worth checking when a company is seeing consistent net losses is how strained its current assets to current liabilities are becoming.

In the short term, the current assets and current liabilities can measure a company's ability to pay short-term debt or obligations due within one year. ESS Tech's short-term liquidity percentage in Q2 was 6.83% (current liabilities/current assets) - demonstrating significant control over short-term liabilities. This significantly improved compared to last year's quarter, which was 8.97%

Current assets and current liabilities stand at $199.4m and $13.6m, respectively.

Total cash for the company is up significantly from recent times, seeing $8.02m as of 30 September 2021 increase to $239m by the end of 2021. Total cash has since fallen to $112.7m for Q2 - however, softened by liquidity.

Total assets were down over the last six months to $216.1m (from $250.2m) - however, total liabilities have also decreased significantly to $29.3m (from $40m).

Long-term liquidity percentage improved in the last six months from 16% to 13.6%.

2021 was also a landmark year for ESS Tech to bolster its balance sheet and get on top of previously elevated liabilities seen in the previous two years. Total assets from FY20 to FY21 increased from $9.02m to $250m (with 95.6% consisting of total cash) - while total liabilities remained fairly flat at $45m.

t3_wmonrs|1660319511|StockMarket|Mark Cuban calls stock buybacks ‘everything wrong with what companies do,’ in response to the proposed tax on stock buybacks.|" The entrepreneur Mark Cuban just took a stand in a debate that's hotly controversial in business circles and Congress.

No subject is more controversial in economic circles right now than taxes. Tensions heighten even more when the specific subject is a new tax aimed at businesses.

Simply put, the business community hates taxes.

No surprise, then, that last week, when the U.S. Senate agreed to a 1% tax on share buybacks as a way to partly finance President Joe Biden's climate and health-care bill, the proposed measure prompted a lot of debate. Opinion on the benefits and disadvantages of buybacks is sharply split.

The House is expected to vote on the bill this week.

Enter Mark Cuban, one of the most listened-to and admired entrepreneurs.

The ""Shark Tank"" star has never made a secret of his aversion to share buybacks. He says buybacks ""are not good for most employees of the companies that do"" them.

Cuban reiterated his dislike of share buybacks in a lengthy exchange, consisting of multiple tweets on Twitter, with Norbert J. Michel, vice president and director of the Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives at the libertarian think tank Cato Institute.

Buybacks Reward Holders Who Want to Sell

""A little-appreciated fact is that most repurchased shares either go to employees, who later sell to investors, or are acquired to reduce equity dilution after employees have sold stock,"" Michel tweeted on Aug. 10. Michel commented on a Wall Street Journal column titled ""The Virtues of Stock Buybacks.""

""Why not just buy back shares from those employees and eliminate their pricing risk when they sell?"" Cuban commented.

""They could do both (compensate with shares and buy shares from them later?)?"" Michel responded.

""But they rarely buy those shares directly from employees,"" Cuban argued. ""And employees can't time their sales to the announcement. So the emps who can least afford the risk and may be the least financially literate, own all pricing risk when they are able to or need to sell.""

*""The BFMA Eastvale Water Treatment Plant required a turnkey solution to replace their dangerous anhydrous ammonia process with a low-risk Liquid Ammonium Sulfate (LAS) system (for monochloramine generation, providing a long-lasting and potent disinfectant residual for the distribution network). The engineers at Progressive Water Treatment worked with BFMA and Entech Engineering throughout the design phase to provide a customized, modular EveraBOX solution.*

*""The EveraBOX unit includes a 2,500-gallon bulk tank (with bulk-fill connection and secondary containment), 130-gallon day tank, transfer pump, three dosing pumps, a pipe and valve manifold and programmable logic controller (PLC), capable of communicating with the existing plant SCADA panel,""* stated Mr. Early.

After a seamless plug-in of the electrical and chemical feed lines, the OriginClear PWT team provided on-site start-up assistance and training for BFMA’s plant operators, including demonstration of the PLC’s alarm capabilities. Currently, OriginClear is assisting BFMA’s systems integrator in flow-pacing the LAS dosing pumps for more efficient chemical use.

*""OriginClear’s PWT team has absolutely been an integral part of the success of this project!""* shared Mark Widdersheim, PE, Senior Project Engineer for Entech Engineering.

Kathy Manning, D-N.C., scooped up thousands of dollars in semiconductor company stock just one day before voting to pass a bill providing massive subsidies to the sector, new disclosures show. One of the companies is already planning large-scale investments made possible due to the legislation.

Manning and her husband purchased up to $30,000 in Micron Technology stocks and up to $95,000 in Nvidia stocks on July 27, the new disclosures show. The next day, Manning voted to pass the CHIPS Act, which will help expand semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the United States while providing the industry tens of billions of dollars in subsidies.

The legislation received plenty of media attention prior to the vote, particularly concerning stock investments made by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's husband.

""I'm proud of my vote to pass this historic investment in American CHIP manufacturing, lower costs, and creating good-paying jobs,"" Manning tweeted after the vote.

Manning's congressional office told Fox Business the investments ""are in accounts entirely controlled by third party managers"" and that she and her husband ""have no discretion or control over the underlying assets held in the accounts.""

""Neither Congresswoman Manning nor her husband exercised, or attempted to exercise, any control or direction over any transactions executed within the accounts,"" the office said.

""Congresswoman Manning supported the CHIPS Act to maintain semiconductor chip manufacturing in the United States because it creates good-paying American jobs and protects national security,"" they added.

 Dow Jones futures rose Friday, looking to cap a solid weekly gain as both the Nasdaq composite and S&amp;P 500 set sights on their fourth straight weekly advance. Tech titan Apple stock is closing in on its latest buy point, as it heads for a six-week win streak. 

On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average trimmed a 1% gain to just 0.1%, while the S&amp;P 500 reversed slightly lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended down 0.6%, after an early 1.3% rally found stout resistance around the 13,000 level. The Nasdaq remains higher for the week, and on track for a four-week win streak."|0.5|0|0|0
t3_wmjzh5|1660307066|StockMarket|FED is creating the next recession...|" It is AMAZING that almost no one is paying attention to how the FED is causing us all to focus only on its short term interest rate.

However, it's mostly about the FED stop purchasing long term bonds, and letting the free market decide what is the rate.

The FED is creating this entire show around interest rates in order to keep everyone focusing on that, instead of focusing on its BRUTAL intervention in the long term bond market.

This intervention is the significant part in holding the market from falling, since once the FED stops buying all these long term bonds, their rates will rise DRAMATICALLY.

This allows the FED to hike rates without TOTALLY COLLAPSING the long term bond market and the housing market with it immediately.

Although it started reducing its purchasing of long term bonds, the FED is doing it EXTREMELY SLOW, while running the ""short term interst rate"" show like it is the most important thing.

Obviously, the media and all of us are totally hypnotized by the FED interest rate show, just like a hypnotized person looking at the pendulum in hypnosis show.

And all of this is in order to show that the FED is fighting inflation.

SHOW TIME will arrive when the FED really pulls out its sticky fingers from the bond market.

If theoretically I sell a single share for 1 cent, this enters the book and becomes the lowest sell order, which turns the bid price to 1 cent.

Can this make the stock value plummet, even for a few milliseconds?

The same question can be asked from the opposite side, I'm a bit fearful with market orders of stocks that don't trade often (not liquid?), what happens if the are not current open sell orders in those couple seconds, except for that one single order well above the ""market price"", let's say 9999 dollars? does that make market orders a dangerous game with illiquid stocks?

t3_wmcptd|1660281061|StockMarket|Investment DISCUSSION: Aluminium|" Hi,

Not an investment recommendation or advice, just some conversation. I am a Macro geek but not so much a stock picker..

Aluminium market is in structurally in deficit as demand has been above production. It already was the case in 2021 and is expected to be the case in 2022, 23, 24, 25 and going forward. In addition, LME stocks are at the lowest level since 2000... 

Recession is coming, according to most experts. I don't challenge the rational, but it seems to be quite priced in commodity markets and economy is not a science (in other terms, there is no determinism like in physics and they could be 'very' wrong). 

Aluminium production is energy intensive: it is estimated (by legitimate banks) that the median cost of production lies at $2,300. Current price is $2,500. The 50% median cost has historically acted as a support to the Al price. 

The median cost is that high because of the energy cost (Aluminium smelting is extremely energy intensive), and I expect (personal view) energy costs to remain elevated in Europe. At current prices, a large part of the production (already in deficit) is at made at a loss. In consequence, more production will be curtailed, and the deficit should worsen. In Europe, electricity prices went up 10-20 fold! (Realize that...) Even Alcoa has some plants producing at a loss, there is no interest for them to feed the market with more supply at a loss, generating a local loss and lower prices globally. 

CONCLUSION:

Supply-Demand rebalance should lead to higher prices. European smelters should be the first to cut production leading to higher prices. American smelters should benefit from higher prices, relative lower costs: Higher margins. 

CAVEAT

There are large regional premiums that bump the price (+$600 in the US, +$550 in Europe). It could also be seen as physical market tightness. 

TANGIBLE MARKET IDEA FOR DISCUSSION Just in case the Market has its pricing correct (recession), I prefer to play it in equities, either outright or medium/LT out the money calls.

Century Aluminium (CENX) is an American Smelter. Despite high energy costs, it should do better than its European peers. It is currently trading at $10, after a recent low of $7. In Q2, volume disappointed but it generates solid net income after several years of loss. To be clear, the company was in bad situation, but if the market behaves (my thesis above) the stock would move from a ""distressed sort of company valuation"" to a cash maker value stock. 

HONNEST ACKOWLEDGMENTS: I am more of a Macro guy and less of a Stock expert. I am seeking advice here as CENX shut down one location in the US due to high Energy costs (still, it has recently generated profits as a company and is compatible with all the above). But: 1) why have they shut down a US plant before the numerous cash burners in Europe? (Maybe hedging makes some Euro company still profitable, but this would be temporary) 

2) Do you see another company in a better position to benefit from this environment?

t3_wm6yxm|1660264263|StockMarket|I have hope for ANOTHER lower CPI report|"The latest inflation report was much better than expected and the next question becomes; will it be ‘too good’ and set the bar too high for the next report?

I’ve been watching closely and I think we’re headed to another shockingly low number.

The last headline inflation number was announced at 8.5% YoY, down from 9.1% the month previous, and with the optimistic estimates of 8.7%.

During this time, up until the last day before the data release, the Cleveland Fed nowcast estimated July’s inflation at 8.82%, so they likely overestimate figures.

I’m not sure what August’s forecast is, if somebody knows it please chime in, but my point is this: Cleveland Fed nowcast for August is currently at 8.38% and dropping daily. You can see a screenshot of their daily adjustments here: https://imgur.com/a/jL0cfKG

Another huge factor in this is oil prices dropping, heavily affecting inflation numbers. The only reason oil went down was because OPEC increase of oil supply; something that we’ve recently agreed to continue and even push harder. Notably, not all countries met OPEC expectations on the increases in the last month, so there’s even more room for improvement than this second increase implies.

My only concerns are that the market might be scared by a potentially inevitable 0.75% increase by the Fed, as they look past the fluff and tackle real inflation. Regardless, we’re not worried about a 1% increase anymore, inflation numbers will be very good on the next report, and there’s a chance (though unlikely) that the Fed does a 0.5% increase instead of a 0.75%, which would be insanely bullish for markets."|0.69|5|0|5

U.S. District Court Judge Cecilia Altonaga in Miami said in the ruling that investors in GameStop Corp, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc and seven other stocks can proceed with a proposed class action lawsuit alleging the restrictions artificially increased the stocks’ supply.

The lawsuit was one of several cases brought against the retail trading platform after it temporarily barred customers from buying certain hot stocks in January 2021, including GameStop and AMC.

Shares of those companies surged to extreme highs thanks to a social media-fueled rally that eventually led Robinhood and others to restrict trading in the affected securities, infuriating retail investors and rattling market confidence. The volatility caused major losses for hedge funds that had bet against the meme stocks.

An attorney for Robinhood did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

On Wednesday, the Walt Disney Company reported that total Disney+ subscriptions rose to 152.1 million during the fiscal third quarter, higher than the 147 million analysts had forecast, according to StreetAccount.

At the end of the fiscal third quarter, Hulu had 46.2 million subscribers and ESPN+ had 22.8 million. Combined, Hulu, ESPN+ and Disney+ have over 221 million streaming subscribers. Netflix, long the leader in the streaming space, had 220 million subscribers, according to the most recent tally.

Disney shares rose more than 6% after the closing bell.

The streaming space has been in a state of upheaval in recent weeks, as Netflix disclosed another drop in subscribers and Warner Bros. Discovery announced a shift in content strategy. While Netflix expects subscriber growth to rebound, uncertainty has left analysts and investors wondering what the future holds for the wider industry.

Also Wednesday, the company unveiled a new pricing structure that incorporates an advertising-supported Disney+ as part of an effort to make its streaming business profitable.

During the fiscal third quarter Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ combined to lose $1.1 billion, reflecting the higher cost of content on the services. Disney’s average revenue per user for Disney+ also decreased by 5% in the quarter in the U.S. and Canada due to more customers taking cheaper multiproduct offerings.

Starting Dec. 8 in the U.S., Disney+ with commercials will be $7.99 per month — currently the price of Disney+ without ads. The price of ad-free Disney+ will rise 38% to $10.99 — a $3 per month increase.

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose on Thursday after all the major averages posted sharp gains in the prior session on the back of a better-than-expected July inflation report.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones added 0.5% or 153 points, while S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.3% and 0.2% higher, respectively.
*****
&gt; Disney shares jumped more than 8% in premarket trading after the media giant posted stronger-than-anticipated subscriber numbers for the last quarter, along with earnings and revenue that topped expectations. Disney also said it would raise prices for Disney+.
*****
&gt; Wednesday’s regular trading session saw all the major indexes rally, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping 535.10 points, or 1.63%, to close at 33,309.51. The S&amp;P 500 added 2.13% to 4,210.24 and hit its highest level since early May, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.89% to 12,854.80, its highest close since late April. The S&amp;P 500 has now rallied more than 15% off its mid-June bear market low and now sits 12% off its record high.
*****
&gt; Hopes that inflation is peaking drove the rally after the consumer price index for July came in at 8.5%, slightly cooler than the 8.7% expected by analysts surveyed by Dow Jones and a slowing pace from the prior month.
*****
&gt; “We’re rallying, and I think it’s really because inflation has been such an overhang for investors and for the market,” Lindsey Bell, Ally Invest’s chief markets and money strategist told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues Thursday with reports from Rivian, Illumina, Poshmark and more. July producer price index data is also slated for Thursday.

Fractional trading can be done outside market hours and is so much easier to use. There’s no daily trade limit or a “cooldown” when u sell something and then want to buy something shortly after and it’s just such a better user experience. My main stocks in Webull are VTI, VOO, and TQQQ along with a few others but I don’t see why I can’t just keep investing in the same large ETF’s in robinhood and have a better experience for any future day trading I might want to do. I don’t get what all the hate on robinhood is and before I make the switch I genuinely want to know if there’s something I’m missing here with potential drawbacks and such.|0.33|0|0|0

I just want to rub it in all your stupid faces that once again, America proved you wrong, ate your lunch and shit in your bed.   


So many anti-American fools kept spouting all this absurd FUD about the dollar collapsing, that America was finished, and China was sure to supplant the Untied States as the greatest force on the planet. 

In the middle of this inflation debacle, so many people kept howling that America's time was up, China was going to run shit, the dollar would be dumped as a reserve currency. I'm also going to guess none of those people bothered to listen to the conference calls of American CEO's, some of the smartest and greediest fuckers on the planet. 

In the middle of the worst pandemic since the early 1900's, the American system once again proved that it was the most formidable socioeconomic system on the planet. China destroyed its status as the world's go-to factory floor by refusing American vaccines and shutting down. China also ruined all hopes of being a reserve currency that the world can trust by declaring a war on capitalism that began with the arrest and torture of Jack Ma. Russia humiliated itself on the world stage by invading a smaller, weaker country and getting it's ass handed to it.   


And where is America in all of this? Coming off GDP growing at a breakneck pace with just a couple quarters of slightly negative growth in exchange for huge decreases in inflation. Stack on top of that huge gains in productivity, wages, and job growth. Oh, and the United States revived commitments the world over to the American-led global system in the wake of Russia's Ukraine invasion. 

The United States is about to enter a major bull market as supply chains adjust and supply catches up with demand. American corporations reporting robust earnings in one of the toughest environments was a marvel to behold. Despite all odds, corporations generally met or beat expections. If you think the bull is running fast now, just wait until those corporations report a quarter where wages have risen and prices have fallen."|0.53|16|0|16

Some additional data:
- I have some losses carried over from previous years
- shares in taxable account would be mostly long-term gains
- shares in Roth I bought two days ago (lol 🚀), but short/long-term doesn't matter here right?
- as of today's close, NVTA is ~25% of my Roth holdings (doesn't include 401k Roth and other tax-deferred holdings); and a much smaller percentage (4%) of all my stock holdings across my portfolio
- I have more than enough in my taxable holdings to meet my short/mid-term needs
