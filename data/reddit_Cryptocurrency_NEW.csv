t3_xcvhbm|1663036002|CryptoCurrency|What determines the value of a coin?|"
As the title states, what determines the price of a coin? I know that it's based on supply and demand and other factors but is there a formula or algorithm that exchanges run to determine the price? If it's based on supply and demand why is the price so unpredictable because supposedly if more people buy in the bear market, there is more demand, thus resulting in the price jumping up.

On top of that various exchanges have slightly different rates. For example for btc/ usdt as of the time of writing this:

Binance: 22,191.89
KuCoin: 22,185.39
Huobi: 22,188.85
Ftx: 22,190.99
Gate.io: 22,193.83

What causes the difference in price for the exchanges and is there a single ""true"" BTC price?"|0.67|2|0|2

At this point after the just there is no way to deny the ""coinbase effect"" is real.  

Hbar has an advanced technology unseen within the rest of the crpto market as it's a ""hashgraph"" and not a block chain and a governing council that includes IBM, Google, Boeing, dla piper, and ubisoft as well as 20 other fortune 500 companies

# HOW I WAS CHEATED BY HUOBI

Huobi liquidated some of my positions when its server was down (It‚Äôs said to be manipulated maliciously later by many other Huobi users. you can check it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOY38UFjIf8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOY38UFjIf8)). and caused me lost 50k+ USD merely in this way.

&amp;#x200B;

[some of my orders liquidated forcedly during Huobi server downtime](https://preview.redd.it/71r195d5zhn91.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2d9308d05f3e37b48a77cbc99bd9013dc344ef8)

[some of my orders liquidated forcedly during Huobi server downtime](https://preview.redd.it/2mto0bf6zhn91.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b52fd613fef8340dcd7262eb3689d1c3b74855c5)

Huobi itself posted many articles about its server issues and maintenances. Below is the one during when my IOST positions liquidation happened and lost 4308USD.

[one Huobi system maintenance notice](https://preview.redd.it/23t6btkp0in91.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=374ee70ad4d96000bde2b217a2eda8b08b47f79d)

Huobi has the policy that Huobi will compensate users whose positions are liquidated forcedly because of Huobi‚Äôs server downtime during prices surging/plumping.

&amp;#x200B;

[Huobi states Huobi will compensate users whose positions are liquidated forcedly because of Huobi‚Äôs issue.](https://preview.redd.it/5ow1tf3r0in91.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=927ce788e9f93e15ce662d2a15a875dd0ad69239)

Then I went to Huobi‚Äôs Beijing office to ask for refunds for some of my abnormal orders, on 11 5&amp;8, 2021.

In the 2nd negotiation, a Huobi‚Äôs agent named Jin Guangtong promised that he will get the refunds to me before when Huobi retires its China users, which is 12 31, 2021. Here is the recording of our talk: [https://www.tiktok.com/@cryptosafett/video/7141557823531437313](https://www.tiktok.com/@cryptosafett/video/7141557823531437313?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7142610754924004910)

But I didn‚Äôt get a penny from Huobi till now, 9 months later than the deadline we agreed on. What‚Äôs more, now both Jin Guangtong and Huobi support refused to admit they promised that.

Huobi admitted their problems, promised to refund, but just never kept it.

# THE RISK FOR YOU

Malicious downtime is only one of the 3 tricks Huobi played to scam future traders on Huobi. I disclosed Huobi‚Äôs dirty business in China and got to know hunders of #HuobiScam victims. And finally I realized a shocking fact!

**Huobi has beening scaming its users in these 9 ways since 2018 to date:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZuwSFachRA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZuwSFachRA)

[I‚Äòm responsible for the authenticity for every Huobi‚Äôs issue disclosed in this video!](https://preview.redd.it/c8x3pktn1in91.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e83a4be3f04f8b4a05adc1127bb9d268f0d50ce)

They are all from every Huobi users‚Äô real feedback. Some lost money on investing in shit coins on spot trading like MDEX, CUBE, HT, HPT, BAGS, etc.. some on mining, more on futures trading.

But as you know, Huobi was expelled out of China in 2021 because of its high risk to people! So to keep its income, **Huobi has shifted its target from China to America, India, Russia, Turkey, South-east Asian countries and more!**

Check the 1 or 2 stars review on Google Play Store or App Store, you‚Äôll know better about Huobi, cuz most 5 stars reviews are left by Huobi trolls with a referral code each.

# LAST WORD

If you are already scammed or cheated by Huobi, report your case to your local regulators and ask for a refund!

t3_xcffs1|1662995713|CryptoCurrency|Lendingblock WARNING: another CeFi company refusing to process withdrawals but never announced it.|"I had a little bit of crypto in Lendingblock thanks to their seemingly generous referral program and high interest rates. It's not a huge CeFi company, not compared to Celsius, but the red flags are now there.  

In January, I deposited some Bitcoin and earned about $133 in referral bonuses. Last week I tried to withdraw it, and they refuse to process it! First they told me I broke their terms and conditions and they could no longer provide me with service. The e-mail said they couldn't even tell me the term/service I broke. To me, this sounded sketchy as hell, so I emailed them back politely asking for more information. They replied back that, after further research, that my account HAD NOT broken any terms, but that they still refused to process the withdrawal because it consisted of referral bonuses, and they ""have paused paying out referral rewards.""  

The only problem is, they haven't announced this ANYWHERE. Even their last tweet on their twitter account August 15th states that business is going as normal:  https://twitter.com/lendingblock/status/1559246797742264323  

And they are STILL advertising their referral program here with an update as of 4 days ago: https://lendingblock.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410223263890-How-does-the-Lendingblock-Referral-Program-work-  

They have since gone silent and are not replying to my e-mail/ticket anymore.  
I have referred several people to LendingBlock, but now I am urging all of you to stay away from it due to these red flags.

The Merge Mosaic is a *student-built*, *no-money-grab* NFT project to celebrate the **Ethereum Merge**! Create art on our 500x500 pixel canvas and have it forever immortalized when Ethereum switches to PoS. Participate by mobilizing your community and minting up to 500 **on-chain** pixels for free!

It's like [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) but with **proof of ownership** &amp; **no censorship!** Come and paint the canvas before the Merge!

&amp;#x200B;

**ü¶Ñ How it works**:

1. Launch the app and connect your wallet
2. Choose up to 500 pixels anywhere on the canvas for free (as long as they're not already taken!)
3. If a pixel you want is taken, bid a minimum of 0.001 ETH to overwrite that pixel!  

   1. If someone else bids on your pixel, all the bid amount is YOURS!
4. Celebrate the Merge ü•≥
5. Claim your NFT when ETH 2.0 launches!

As the title says, I can't be the only one here that is so tired of hearing about the eth merge and what it will and wont do for eth. 

I just want it to be over and done with and continue on with business.

Don't get me wrong, I realize this is a big deal. I don't think any chain has moved from PoW to PoS before (correct me if I'm wrong). Let alone the 2nd biggest crypto moving to PoS.

But I feel like there is just soooo much hype that its bound to fail (well at least not live up to the hype). Not epically fail, but there will be major bugs to fix and probably hacks. Which will send the price down.

I do think its a sale the news event (i hope not) but I think it will be.

But what else would we expect from such a devoted WEF slave such as JT?

He states the following; ""Telling people they can opt out of inflation by investing in volatile crypto currencies is not responsible leadership. By the way anyone who followed that advice would have seen their life savings destroyed.""

First of all, one cannot opt out of inflation we are all stuck paying ridiculous prices thanks to the reckless spending of politicians such as JT who has cumulatively spent the most out of any prime minister in history with no signs of slowing down. We can however, invest in more deflationary assets to protect purchasing power.

Secondly, I tripled my savings by investing in the bitcoin ETFs and crypto miners in early 2021. Not to mention the countless people who have attained financial freedom, and equality thanks to crypto. He makes no mention of volatile nature of tech stocks and other sectors as well as overall market conditions that have contributed largely to the decline in prices.

As mentioned above, Trudeau and his deputy prime minister Freeland (ironic I know), are deeply embedded with the WEF, and will do anything it takes  to maintain their fiat privilege that the majority of the world are suffering at the hand of.

Needless to say, this drama teacher has no experience with financial management, has a record of reckless and irresponsible spending, and is doing everything he can to make sure Canadians are divided, and economically screwed for the years to come. He has near-single handidly instilled a hate for my own countries political system, as well as social circumstances. I will continue to advocate for bitcoin, crypto and financial equality/inclusion for all. 

Ignore the noise, no matter who it's from and keep stacking sats. At least we can sleep at night knowing we aren't enslaved by corrupt fiat loving dinosaurs."|0.49|0|0|0

On September 10th, 2022 the first Centralized exchange listed MOONs the shit coin of the future.

Things started off pretty bad with a sale around $0.05 which set the starting price really low, Fighting the bad start moons were still able to reach respectable yet disappointing to many price of around $0.17 hitting a short spike of around $0.25.

After the start things began going bad for moons, the price has been consistently falling since then hitting a low of $0.088 earlier today.

pricing is currently around $0.098 and seems to be climbing.

Here at Moon News Network (MNN) we predict that moons will still reach $1.00 by end of 2022, which means it's a great time to buy. ^((not financial advice))

Mind you, these aren‚Äôt some small time companies with no significance. I‚Äôm talking about Fortune 500 companies with hundreds of billions of dollars at their disposal.

Plus you also have to think about the fact that all of these major companies have entire departments responsible for taking important financial decisions for these companies. And if they‚Äôre seeing that investing billions of dollars into crypto is the right choice, then who am I to fight with a department of financial experts?

We‚Äôre starting to see institutions and companies enter the market more than we‚Äôve ever seen before and at an ever increasing rate. This alone gives my trust in crypto by a lot.

Facebook, Disney, Coca Cola, and Stripe, and (just today) Starbucks partnered with Polygon making them the business development side of Ethereum. While Reddit, the website you're reading this post on, rolled out community points on Arbitrum. Ethereum has positioned itself as the de facto L1 in the space, and L2s will pave the way for mass adoption.

NFT sales on Solana and Polygon spiked by massive amounts, a lot of which was boosted by the presence of these billion dollar companies and fired up communities.

These companies have an extremely strong influence over a gargantuan number of the world population. And as Starbucks mentioned today, you will hardly notice that you're using a blockchain.

So that potential audience is starting to see these companies join crypto and Web3. Awareness is starting to grow.

Yet it‚Äôs no secret that the crypto market hasn‚Äôt been performing well the past year or so and that seemed to spark some concern (especially for the new comers that haven‚Äôt been through crypto bear markets before) for the future of crypto.

But price action alone is NOT an indicator of how a market is heading. Development and fundamental growth is arguably more important than any other indicator and right now I think the crypto market is killing it in that regard. You miss a bull run once you're absent in bear.

TL,DR: Don't worry about your blue-chip bags, mass adoption is just starting and the potential is massive, with a future that's looking brighter every single day (except for that day when they sanctioned Tornado)."|0.86|218|0|218

My latest obsession is the bear market as I have been trying to understand everything I can about the bear and past bear cycles to identify potential bottoms. While studying, I have come across some peculiar similarities between the key 2015, 2018, and 2022 bear markets. It is as though history rhymes if not often straight out repeats itself. Let me give some examples of what I mean:

&amp;#x200B;

**1) The cross of the weekly 50 moving average below the 100 moving average**

Every time the 50 week moving average (green) crossed down below the weekly 100 moving average (orange), the bottom had already been in a couple of weeks before. I marked these key moments with a blue vertical line. This cross just happened a couple of weeks ago, a little bit after we made the June low, which many perceive to be the bottom but time will have to tell if it is. It happens like clockwork and the time between the low and the cross is very similar in all three instances, differing only one or two weeks between the three times this happened at a cycle low.

&amp;#x200B;

[The cross of the weekly 50 \(green\) down below the weekly 100 \(orange\) moving average \(picture made with tradingview, source BlockChainBacker\)](https://preview.redd.it/zdinaqsyygn91.png?width=2093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7873e98a48d6f382a3fe31211d2cf37cc6254ec2)

**2) The cross of the weekly 20 and 100 moving average**

Every time the 20 week moving average (green) crossed down the 100 week moving average (orange), the bottom was in within a week. Some people predicted this would happen months months ago and then like clockwork, a dump followed and the bottom was in in June. It happened all three times. This one is even more peculiar, because it really bottoms in a week.

[The cross of the weekly 20 \(green\) down below the weekly 100 \(orange\) moving average \(picture made with tradingview, source Coinskid\)](https://preview.redd.it/zqxtm1b28hn91.png?width=2091&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e552f2d7e6aa8f7218d55f5ed7f2058732e0de4)

**3) Weekly RSI always dips to the same point and then bounces**

RSI is a strengh index and high = lots of relative strength while low = very little relative strength. Everytime we hit oversold levels with very low RSI (under the purple area in the chart below) we bounced and the bottom was in. It is almost like clockwork.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin's weekly RSI chart. RSI below. \(Picture made with tradingview\)](https://preview.redd.it/s34b1apozgn91.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2613288ac92c7821b6969263832751b3c62cdfa)

&amp;#x200B;

**4) The Puell Multiple always dips hard once into the green and then does a retest\*\***

The Puell Multiple is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of bitcoins (in USD) by the 365-day moving average of daily issuance value. This is quite technical and I will not elaborate too much to keep it short. The red upper band reflects miner revnues being higher than historical norms while the green band below signifies that miner revenues are significantly lower than historical norms. Every bottom has a big dip in the green zone, then bounces and does a little bit of a retest. After that its off to the races.

[Puell multiple chart \(source: EmmyMoonie\)](https://preview.redd.it/oitmj57e0hn91.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59999cab6dd1f08269c5bad31a16f6ba0e31b36c)

&amp;#x200B;

**5) The duration from cycle all time high to the bottom of the bear is very similar**

There is a strange similarity in how long it takes to get from the cycle top to the bottom of the bear market.

* From the cycle top in 2013 to the bottom of the bear in 2013 took us 59 weeks.
* Similarly, from the peak end of 2017 to the bottom in December 2018 took 52 weeks.

Ironically, if one considers April 2021 the top, which many do because then RSI was a lot higher than November 2021 (see Chart above) and hype was a lot higher than November 2021 (e.g. the Google Searches, attention by media), then we had 61 weeks from top to bottom in June 2022. Very similar to prior bear markets. There is some evidence for this as the fractal that we see now is very similar to the end of the bear markets of the past cycle, including the capitulation moment when Luna and 3AC blew up.

But of course, this point is a lot more speculative, as numerically the top was in November 2021. From that point, we are nowhere near 50 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusions and Questions**

In short, I keep on being surprised to see the chart similarities between the different key bear markets in recent years. I could give more examples, such as the Pi Cycle indicator just about nailing the bottom everytime (which is based on moving averages) and us landing on the total market cap 200 weekly moving average in the last few years for every bottom. But this should be sufficient to  illustrate my point.

**A few questions:**

* **Did I miss any similarities? I would love to learn!**
* **How is this possible? Is it all just a coincidence or is this market psychology and whales keeping an eye on these charts?**
* **Can we derive any meaning from this going forward?**"|0.74|13|0|13

Comparing crypto against traditional credit/debit cards issued by banks, I'd say crypto wins by a long shot. Merchants and businesses are slowly accepting crypto as payment method, so we should see credit/debit cards lose traction in the long run. 

Even VISA announced that it will be using Blockchain tech for its own benefit.

The way I see this will turn out in the future is that credit/debit cards will cease to exist as they're replaced by stablecoins and decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

Maybe VISA, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover will make stablecoins of their own? If credit/debit cards are eliminated, then we'll be on the right path towards a full-fledged cashless society. Instead of carrying with a physical wallet full of paper money or plastic cards, you would only carry a smartphone with a digital wallet containing the coins of your choice.

What do you think? Will cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for credit/debit cards in the future? If not, why? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much."|0.62|7|0|7

First, for those who don't know what impermanent loss is:

Being a Liquidity Provider (LP) for yield farming and liquidity mining can provide awesome returns, but at a risk of impermanent loss. Impermanent loss is where the LP experiences a temporary loss of value due to price volatility of the trading pair. Additionally, it shows the value/money the LP could have realized if they held on to the assets instead of locking them in the liquidity pool.

‚ÄúImpermanent loss‚Äù describes the losses LPs experience due to **price divergence**. The key word is ‚Äúimpermanent‚Äù, the loss due to price divergence **may be reversed** if the price divergence is also reversed. Although, this is not a guarantee that the loss will reverse, again this is the RISK!

Another great ELI5 I read in the past describing [Impermanent Loss with dragons, unicorns and magical fees](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sb7cnx/impermanent_loss_explained_like_you_are_5_years/)!

No one knows how the market will react or move, so it's possible Ethereum will go up from here and never come down or it might hit 10K and swing back down to 1.5K, but who knows? NOBODY!

For LPs starting recently, let's say your Ethereum average value is 1K\~1.5K and expect Ethereum to hit 10K in the next 1\~5 years, are you worried about the Impermanent loss from providing liquidity?

LPs that are bullish may counter that the fees make up for the impermanent losses. For example, if Ethereum doubles and the trading pair stays at the same price, impermanent losses can be calculated to be &lt;6% which could be much less than the rewards from providing liquidity.

Would love to hear your thoughts and worries (or confidence) with providing liquidity and future outlook on Ethereum."|0.5|0|0|0

Joined this industry mainly motivated by the revolutionary potential, and making a real difference in economy and human interactions.

But all this experience has shown that the big players (institutions) such as exchanges, service providers, etc... have made the market become a big auction house where the biggest bidders win.

They masquerade as idealists, but sell their values to the first high bid they face, ignoring many legitimate projects with real solutions, who don't want to play this game.

The ""adoption"" of the crypto market today is largely based on:

***&gt; Which token team pays the most for listing/partnership.***

It's no longer about listing/using projects that solve problems in the best way, but about earning as much USD as possible in the shortest time.

These mechanics are very favorable to the formation of financial bubbles.

The ecosystem is destroying itself without even notice this, as higher bidders aren't necessarily the best projects, and are usually made with unsustainable economics (using money for self-promotion and bribe, instead of development).

Would love to hear your thoughts on this matter.

The team behind ETHPoW updated its GitHub on Friday morning saying they would use the ChainID ‚Äò10001‚Äô after the Merge goes off (even though that ChainID corresponds to *smartbchtest*, **so already taken**) , Though the team also said that the ChainID would remain at ‚Äò1‚Äô (the same as Mainnet) until the day of The Merge in response to Coinbase requesting it be updated.

Here's what could go down if ETHPoW retained the same ChainID and nonce as Mainnet: **all and any trades that go through on the ETHPoW chain could be cloned on Mainnet,** leaving people open to a few exploits that could very well drain their wallets. Any malicious actor could set up a *proxy smart contract* on Mainnet before the merge, then after the merge, upgrade an ETHPoW SC to allow people to say, sell their ETH at a premium as an incentive while simultaneously setting the Mainnet SC to send all received ETH through Tornado Cash.

Then the ETHPoW protocol would obviously get flooded by people tryna offload their ETH and arb the shit out of that premium, but here's the catch, **those txns would be replicated on Mainnet since it shared ChainID and nonce**, and since the mainnet SC would run the ETH through Tornado with no actual token given back to the user in return for the ""sell"", they'd be stuck on ETHPoW with no ETH and a stablecoin that doesn't even support that chain (No stable does so far) **essentially rugging themselves**.

What's worse is that this could all be freaking solved by merely adjusting a few lines of code on ETHPoW **right now** and eliminate any danger, **but given that the ETHPoW twitter account blocked a few** [ETH dev accounts that pointed out this issue](https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1568144432284704768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1568207064752701442%7Ctwgr%5Ebf7c9e831e14f376f273b794b3ae7f1538308014%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptoslate.com%2Ftrading-ethpow-tokens-could-open-users-to-risk-of-losing-mainnet-eth%2F) **I doesn't seem like they care in the slightest**.

There's simply no reason to wait after the merge to fix the code, shit, **they could even fork it right now** but surely they're entertained with mining as many actual ETH as they can *while* they can. Is this the kind of people  you're willing to trust to secure the network you transact your hard earned assets on? What do you guys think of the ETHPoW team? And about forking ETH in the first place?"|0.66|8|0|8

https://bifrost-finance.medium.com/salp-vsbond-the-first-step-of-the-dotsama-ecosystem-in-the-bond-market-da13877bf151


Here is an excerpt from the summary, but definitely have a look into the article to get the full picture:

&gt;Bifrost vsBond market brings an old TradFi classic to the Polkadot and Kusama DeFi ecosystem. With the introduction of the vsBond market, Bifrost started to fill the missing part of a fixed return market for buyers. For sellers, this market provides an opportunity to gain control over their liquidity and bring back flexibility in a system which was originally intended to be inflexible. There are multiple opportunities and strategies for all users from various backgrounds.  Even in these early stages, there is an abundance of opportunities, and the more accepted it will become, the greater and diverse the strategies will be.

Currently I split the life savings by buying some Doge, Algogrand, Aergo, Polka Dot, Amp, Polygon, Solana, Litecoin, Bitcoin, and the usual ones that Coinbase gave me after learning about Sandbox and The Graph (LUNC).

Furthermore, what's the typical period of holding and what is the typical times or days that have the most volume traded? 

I am not new in financial investment or portfolios, I am just new to crypto because well the bear is a good sign for buyers.

If you have anything that'll help me become a billionaire with crypto, please let me know."|0.33|0|0|0

t3_xcdmet|1662991266|CryptoCurrency|A beginners Guide to Cryptocurrency:|"**What is a blockchain?**

It is an ‚Äúimmutable ledger.‚Äù Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked off the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. ‚ÄúMining.‚Äù Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.

But its not all bad. POW is still the oldest and most battle tested consensus algorithm, and many argue it‚Äôs more secure because of it.

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed ‚ÄúConsensus‚Äù algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure ‚Äúlottery‚Äù consensus mechanism to ‚Äúelect‚Äù the next ‚Äúslot leader‚Äù to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each ADA coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It‚Äôs so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. Hopefully this summer with the ""merge."" In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. Tezos has its Emmy+, and the list goes on.

Each have their own way of doing things. But ‚Äúgen 3‚Äù is¬†not¬†Proof of work.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no ‚Äúdecentralized network of immutable ledgers.‚Äù Which is because that‚Äôs just fancy talk for machines running our code to support the blockchain.

**What are Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That‚Äôs it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you may see a $65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you‚Äôll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway).

Currently there are 19,118,581 BTC out there at a cost of 24,340.01.

That means, the market cap is 24,340.01 x 19,118,581 = 465,346,452,725.81 (465B)

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 33,739,028,516. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 130B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it‚Äôs \~6700X more. DogeCoin also makes 10,000 new coins a minute.

At a price of .50 that means the market cap for Cardano is .5 X 33,739,028,516 =16,869,514,258 (16B).

You'll need a 1 Trillion Market Cap for Cardano to hit 30

33,739,028,516 \* 30 = 1012170855480.

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa ‚Äì 499B

Adobe ‚Äì 250B

Amazon ‚Äì 1.7T

It‚Äôs very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even ‚Äúburn‚Äù coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I ‚Äúget in early?‚Äù**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we‚Äôre only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 1.23 Trillion. That‚Äôs only 0.11% of the world‚Äôs wealth.

When looking for ‚Äúwhat could be the next big thing‚Äù, find something with a low market cap regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech; the two Ts.

Also ask yourself:

What are these coins use cases?

Who is their target audience for adoption?

Who is funding them?

Who is their team building it? What is their history?

Do they have a good plan?

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.‚Äôers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that ‚ÄúHold On for Dear Life.‚Äù These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to ""Average Down."" Or Dollar cost average (DCA) by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only ‚Äútake profit‚Äù buy selling a small portion when price is really high.

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often ‚Äútest‚Äù the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are ‚Äúweak hands.‚Äù Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.

Take Luna for example. You probably lost your investment. Period. But, you never know.

Look at Ripple. Look at Shib.

Both were thought to be dead, but they live.

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What are things to look out for?**

Do your own research. There are now more then 4K types of crypto currencies. You can create your own in about 30 minutes with the right free tools.

The mortality rate of new coins is super high this year. Lots of people trying to do Pump and Dumps.

There is nothing in life that goes up for no reason, if it does, it‚Äôs a Ponzi scheme.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.

Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.

Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.

But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.

When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.

Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn‚Äôt much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the ‚Äúdream‚Äù is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Lastly, there is the notification of ‚Äúpassive income‚Äù and ‚Äúinterest.‚Äù

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to ‚Äústake‚Äù their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you‚Äôd have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With chains like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

‚ÄúSmart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.‚Äù

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party ‚Äútrusted agent‚Äù like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is ‚ÄúANY Code‚Äù that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

Games, sure, put in the chain. Check out CryptoKitties.

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can‚Äôt be messed with.. Ever..

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens are metadata attached to an asset.

The metadata are things like who created it, and when. Along with the most important piece the link to the asset.

The asset is what most people think of when they talk about NFTs.

Its a digital file. Like a jpg or a mov file.

But its not stored in the blockchain like most assume.

Instead they are stored, most often, in IPFS storage.

IPFS is very cool, but its not blockchain, and thus not ""immutable.""

So what‚Äôs the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the ‚Äúinternet.‚Äù That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.

What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.

Let us sit and think about that for a second.

De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. ‚ÄúA diamond NFT is forever‚Äù

Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.

It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in Decentraland, a virtual world.

That of course is the rosier outlook on NFTs.

Unfortunately, in practice there are many gaps today.

The first I already mentioned; The asset is not stored in the blockchain.

What that means is that the IPFS provider could ""unpin"" your asset, and if its not saved anywhere else, you'll end up with an NFT that has metadata that points to a url that has nothing there.

The second problem, is that there are thousands of blockchains. People can take your asset, because its publicly pined, and then go create an NFT on another blockchain, and then claim theirs is in fact the original. You'd have to check every chain that supports NFTs to ensure it was in fact the first first.

Or people have taken hard artwork, like paintings, and then minted and sold them as NFTs.

**Terminology?**

HODL = Hold On for Dear Life

Hopium = Represents the belief that the situation will someday improve.

FOMO = Fear of Missing Out

FUD = Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt

Bear/Bearish = ""Bears"" believe that an asset, for example a digital currency, will decline in value.

Bull/Bullish = If a trader believes that an asset will rise in value, he or she is a ""bull.""

**Who the hell are you?**

Who me? I‚Äôm not a finical advisor. I work for a major software company as my full-time job, and manage Microsoft Active Directory and Azure AD.¬†üì∑I do however love the idea of blockchain, and what it can bring to the world.

I'm currently using Coinbase as a way to accumulate these coins, and while I'm fine paying the fees that Coinbase has I'm not OK with the cut APR that Coinbase gives out. The most insulting one is ATOM which normally pays out 10%, I'm only getting 5% (!) through Coinbase. To get the point, what should I do to get the full APR?

***‚ÄúGuys, I‚Äôve found an actual actionable arbitrage on Pancakeswap to boost your CAKE yields by 20X‚Äù***

Naturally, all the financial geniuses of CC pooh pooh it with one of the main counter-point was how is the high yield sustainable? 

Let‚Äôs take a look at CAKE price in the last few weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hk92fj5qnfn91.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=feec268aea69a0bf4861d7048aa6c2bd9e485bca

You might be wondering how does an inflationary reward token managed to maintain its price and climb the BTC ratio. The simple answer is because **THE MAJORITY OF CAKE HOLDERS CAN‚ÄôT SELL**. 

&amp;#x200B;

[PCS Cake Staking pool](https://preview.redd.it/0pbz085xnfn91.jpg?width=429&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1208263f20e4497940d500e41b4cb9fc84b818d5)

They all got baited in to lock for 1 year at Pancakeswap last April when the  1 year lock APY was +200%. Stop looking at charts and drawing funny lines on it, prices go up because people buy and prices go down because people sell. What happens when people can‚Äôt sell? price may not go up but it won‚Äôt go down which is pretty good if you‚Äôre earning high APY.

Hence my strategy to yield arbitrage the Pancakeswap syrup pools yields

https://preview.redd.it/07hi1ugnmfn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=758f8b6824c554af7ece11f134c79852f68b40aa

Is doing quite well earning good APY without locking you in.

And if you don‚Äôt have the time and 5 figures of capital to spend, just use my dapp‚Äôs vault, [https://happyhippo.farm/](https://happyhippo.farm/) 

Compared to other large Dapps in BSC

PCS requires you to lock for 1 year and ALPACA needs 2.5X leverage just to give you a measly 7% APY. The  strategy that I presented here and implemented in hippo‚Äôs vault leads the pack for pure flexible cake yields without any locking or using leverage thereby greatly reducing your risk.

  

**5 Days results**

https://preview.redd.it/wp9k0nytmfn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f72347ff90ffeefe61b44363ab39c6aa8e76c52

Averaging 0.12% per day so far

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is the vault APY falling?**

The APY depends primarily on the relative price of CAKE vs the tokens in the syrup pools, as CAKE price rise has outpaced the other tokens in the pools so the APY has fallen a bit. However if the tokens price rise again, the APY will go back up again.

**How long will this last ?**

The WOM syrup pools is set to expire on October 29th but when it does you can just move to the other pools.

**What‚Äôs the maximum capacity ?**

Looking at the current pool liquidity, probably about 10-20MM USD or about 2.5-5MM CAKE before the APY starts to drop significantly

**Is stacking CAKE a good idea ?**

PCS has introduced a supply CAP of 750MM token for CAKE and its price seems to have bottomed out. If you get out before the majority of locked CAKE tokens unlock +-40 weeks from now, you should do alright as the APY will make up for any potential price correction.

Crypto is even close to becoming mass adopted like the stock market is. 90% of people I know IRL don‚Äôt know about any other crypto than Bitcoin. Some have heard of Ethereum but not many. I‚Äôm a fairly young guy and most of my friends invest in the stock market but are absolutely oblivious to crypto. I used to think crypto was more mainstream but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm here on crypto Reddit and other crypto social media streams. 

I will say that crypto IS growing a lot and more and more people know about it than say 5 years ago. However, you can‚Äôt really use crypto in everyday life. You can‚Äôt buy food at a restaurant or use crypto to buy clothes at the mall. That is when crypto is truly going to be adopted.

Crypto is on a good trajectory. I‚Äôm not saying it can‚Äôt be or is not being adopted. What I‚Äôm saying is that we‚Äôre farther away than what a lot of people think. Fiat isn‚Äôt going anywhere anytime soon or maybe ever.

t3_xcd89e|1662990250|CryptoCurrency|"The Rainbow Chart did it again: We dipped below the ""Basically a Fire Sale"" level and bounced hard"|"The Bitcoin Rainbow Price Chart is one of the most famous charts in all of crypto, that was made in 2014 and despite popular belief has not been adjusted since then. The Rainbow Chart started as a meme in response to PlanB's S2F model. While PlanB's S2F model has clearly failed -and in my view never had any predictive validity to begin with due to its huge standard deviations- the Rainbow Chart has done an impressive job at identifying good moments to sell and good moments to buy. It is particularly good for identifying great moments to buy, as the dark blue level of ""Basically a Fire Sale"" has always provided us with the best opportunities for buying.  

After dipping below the Basically a Fire Sale level once in March 2020, we just did it again. Similar to in 2020, we immediately bounced back up. See the following charts:

[The Bitcoin Rainbow Price Chart](https://preview.redd.it/l6lwgmehjfn91.png?width=1264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c61e04ebae0039716b98cf5bcff73ee21280209)

Hence, the ridiculed meme chart did it again. It is pretty crazy to think that all one had to do over the past years was follow the rainbow chart, and that despite all the macro issues and uncertainty in this world we are still finding support on the bottom of this rainbow. Is this just a fluke or should we attribute meaning to this development? Do you expect this model to fail? 

Lastly, want to know something even more crazy? Even the ETH rainbow price chart identified the bottom very well this year. ETH already bounced to the next level of Undervalued.

t3_xcd1sz|1662989776|CryptoCurrency|Most of us will miss the next bullrun (DCA crew not included)|"It's simply impossible to perfectly time the bottom, but still people try to do so. Most people in this sub seem to agree on one thing: the bear market will be long and prices will continue to build lower lows.

The end result? People will buy Bitcoin at $50k again, because that's when they finally realize that the bear market is over.

I'm not saying it's impossible we could see $10k Bitcoin, but how likely is that? Nobody can see upcoming news or how deep the recession will be.

But what do we know? We know that Bitcoin (for example) has shown us it's not impossible to reach $69k (which is nice). We also know that right now the price is much lower.

Do the math. Let's pretend BTC will reach $90k some day (you can replace it with one of your shitcoins and do the same):

* $1k invested at a BTC price of $20k =&gt; +$3,500
* $1k invested at a BTC price of $10k =&gt; +$8000
* $1k invested at a BTC price of $50k =&gt; +$800

Now think about it, is it worth it to wait, when you still think BTC will make new ATHs? Or will you kick your own ass for missing the train again?"|0.65|17|0|17

## TLDR
Ethereum Mainnet will merge with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake system, ending of proof-of-work (mining) for Ethereum. [Finematics TLDR video](https://twitter.com/finematics/status/1569311652067135489?s=20&amp;t=3Z5AAWitUca7ArOm62YoVA)


## The Merge!
The Merge represents the joining of the existing execution layer of Ethereum (the Mainnet we use today) with its new proof-of-stake consensus layer, the Beacon Chain. (Formerly called Eth2)

It eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining and instead secures the network using staked ETH. A truly exciting step in realizing the Ethereum vision ‚Äì more scalability, security, and sustainability. This will reduce Ethereum's energy consumption by ~99.95%.

The Merge is scheduled to happen on block 58,750,000,000,000,000,000,000 (that's a lot of zeros), so the actual date/time is a little bit of a moving target, but there are a few websites to help predict when that will be:

* https://bordel.wtf/
* https://wenmerge.com/

This is the first time a blockchain has swapped its concensus mechanism for another, live, uninterrupted.

## FAQs

* Will this effect transaction fees? Gas fees will not change
* Will there be downtime? Zero downtime
* Will transaction speeds change? Not noticeably

## Do I have to do anything?

If you own any Ethereum, ERC-20s (tokens), or ERC-721s (NFTs):

* Nope, enjoy :)

If you are a validator:

* Make sure your Beacon Chain Client is updated (lighthouse/lodestar/nimbus/prysm/teku)
* Make sure you have a *suggested-fee-recipient* configured
* Make sure your jwt secret is set properly from your execution engine client (geth/nethermind/etc...) in your beacon chain client config
* If you want to sanity check your setup, Somer Esat has great guides: https://someresat.medium.com/

If you a running a node:

* You will need to run a consensus client also, geth guide [here](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/consensus-clients) and consensus guides [here](https://someresat.medium.com/)

If you are a miner:

* After the merge, blocks won't be produced by mining anymore, thus no block rewards.
* You will need to run a consensus client (see ""running a node"") if you want to keep running a node.

I get that the merge will change it to proof of stake, as I was still new to the industry I didn‚Äôt stake my coins for the merge and have trialled it now with a little bit, with the merge being days away is it worthwhile to stake the rest now? 

As I saw the price depeg I was a bit dubious and don‚Äôt understand how the conversion back will work afterwards, does it mean I‚Äôm going to get less back for what I put in? 

Thirdly and lastly, how will I get the new ether? Will it just be swapped out or will I have to pay some crazy gas fees to get them swapped on some platform or does it happen in wallet/exchange?

Tldr; 
Is it still worthwhile to lock up ether for merge?

This are just small tips on how to manage bear , when it comes to bear people are always scared of losing money scared of taking risk while some use it as an opportunity to make more fortune once they can hold while some become broke , selling during bear losing much amount of funds due to reasons some taking loan to invest e.t.c and so many other reason so am going to share some tips on how to overcome or manage bear.

-Remember that cryptocurrency markets are dynamic
If you look back in history bear always follow after the bullish experienced  and the market is always made up of four phases which are the

- accumilation
- makeup
- distribution
- markdown

-During market lulls, enlighten self.
During this period of experiencing bear learn more about crytocurrencies and also blockchain technology and also do more research on projects you considering to invest there are different platforms and books you can learn from during this period.

-Leave the graphs alone.
Once you keep steering at the charts then you start thinking and start worrying whether to hold or sell, put the charts away and set parameters  when to buy and when to sell it also helps.

-Take into account the long term goal . (HODL)
Think of the profits you will make when the price goes up when dealing with crypto you have a target once you want to go into trading of any form of investment holding for a long time is actually a good one and concluding during this experience make sure you are active  and educate your self more  , on things and guidelines that will help you succeed in any of the seasons either bear or bull."|0.61|5|0|5

This 35 million was invested in a project by the name of Hodlnaut. Yes, the name doesn't inspire much confidence. Basically, Hodlnaut functions like Celsius, the comparison is mostly used to describe only the similarity in their business operations, as they acted as a bank basically by taking user deposits and paying users interest and also lending those deposits to other users on margin. That is from what I could gather as eerily their faq page is currently down. The company claimed 20,000 users and around 250 million in assets with an interest APR of 7.5% with instant withdrawals which would be okay except we were/are in a nasty bear market.

Unfortunately, also like Celsius they suspended user withdrawals and are now in a legal process to determine if, when and how users will be reimbursed. They have also announced the cutting of **80%** of their staff. and dropped their interest rates to **0%.** They are technically not in bankruptcy but in something called ""interim judicial management"" where generally a company was mismanaged and is currently insolvent or seriously in financial distress but is expected to make cash to be able to pay off the debt in the future. So the company in essence receives new managers to ""fix"" the company who are external/unrelated to the company. They are not expected to go into liquidation i.e. sell large amounts of assets. For simplicity, it is not exactly inaccurate to think of it as something akin to restructuring or Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, however.

Algo claims this represents less than 3% of their assets and virtually wouldn't affect their operations or liquidity as far as users would experience. That may remain to be seen. But the real problem is this. Algorand invested in Holdnaut and Holdnaut invest in***...****drumroll please...* everyone's unfriendly neighbourhood crypto company **Terra.** As a matter of fact, Hodlnaut puts their financial distress down to the crash of UST in their media release. Another point to consider is that it is easier for these companies to have you believe it's all Terra fault since everyone hates UST right now and they make a good scapegoat and you won't be too mad at the company. I'm not saying they're lying but clearly a lot of these guys can't be trusted. The fact that they are in judicial management means Hodlnaut definitely had poor management so they are clearly culpable.

We know a lot of these crypto companies invest in each other but the more we find out the worse it feels. I really feel the people who ask questions on how to do your own research when a lot of the specifics of the info just aren't public. A good rule of thumb is just if it seems too good to be true it probably is. And even if it isn't you have to be realistic about and can't ignore market conditions. And if you can, try out a *truly* decentralized project, not something that functions on the whims of a few people at the top.

I'd love to hear what the general sentiment of Algo is.

Billionaires, not millionaires. JFC.

So I'm going to do some math do let you know the amount of x??? you would have to get from the next bull run!

Let's assume a 25'000$ as initial investment (which is already above average, I'd say).

Let's say that you entered crypto in 2017, before the crazy bull run at the end of the year.

You buy 25'000$ worth of ETH. That is more or less a coin for every 100$, which means you now own a whopping 250 ETH! Nice!

At the all time high (4891.70$) you had 1'222'925$! It's good, isn't it? Well you're still missing 998'777'075$, but anything is possible! Let's say that ETH on the next bull run reaches 100'000$ per coin (opium intensifies). You would now have 25'000'000$... 

To become a BILLIONAIRE with crypto with an investment of 25'000$ you would have to get a x40000, which means that ETH should sit at 4'000'000$ per coin! 

Unless you've invested since the early days, there's basically no way (other than being the luckiest person alive and getting a moon shot before it happens) to become a billionaire with crypto.

Just forget it and become a millionaire instead."|0.63|31|0|31

Recently, I noticed that shops around me are starting to accept cryptocurrency coins and even to the point where even jobs that my wife got came from acquiring funds through an Initial Coin Offering. The company didn't turn out to be successful but it's still a start. I also noticed that bookstores are selling blockchain related books just a few hours ago.

So I've started dabbling with copy-trading day traders on Bybit and so far it's been working out very well. I had to tweak a bit here and there with the settings and finding the right trader. But I have to say I'm loving the fact that I don't have to worry about the ups and downs of the market and make the difficult decisions of when to buy, hodl or sell.

But a part of me thinks that this is too good to be true. A literal money printer, churning out USDT.

So what do you guys think? What are the risks here? Bybit going bankrupt and locking my funds? USDT depegging? Trader going awol and making bad trades?

Is there a way to hedge against the risks? E.g. another copy-trading platform other than Bybit, preferably with USDC as the trading pair?

So basically I am treating this sub as a personal journal, in hope that the usual voices which are answering are kind of real this time.

1. Impermanent loss. Since most of the defi project got hit hard during the bear market and already lost a lot of feathers. I've seen project losing 80-95% in value and a shitload of people got rekt... I assume it's rather unlikely that this happens again, since the bear market is crabbing around with the usual -/+10%. 


2. It's rather easy to sort of the trash project from the ""good"" ones.  I see a lot of flat lining projects with no sign of a slight recovery and some projects with the usual bear market trends. This makes it easy to have some triage :)

3. Is it with the hassle?! I mean, I could just slam some money into the biggies, eth and btc and just wait it out, rather than to search for good projects and reasonable APYs.

4. Taxes, taxes,taxes... In Germany it's already complicated with staking, but auto compounding and defi in general? Yooo, GL HF doing your taxes....

Yeah... So what do you guys think? In which defi are you invested in and why? Is it a good timing to get into defi?"|0.69|6|0|6

t3_xc1e6d|1662951162|CryptoCurrency|AI + Crypto Concept|"As someone who has been into crypto for a while but has also been big into using AI like Midjourney and StableDiffusion, I thought it would be interesting and valuable to merge them.

With Banano for example, they have Folding@Home which lets you lend computing power to medical research and earn the Banano crypto currency as a reward. This is really cool but google's AI Folding seems like it's going to eliminate the need for it in time. The idea of contributing computing power for a productive purpose like that and getting a reward is still useful though and would be perfect to combine with an AI such as stable diffusion. 

The main issue with the AI is that most people's computers dont have a graphics card with enough VRAM for larger images and so they can't generate images at home. With a Folding@Home type system people could lend computing power by generating the images for people who pay a small amount of crypto in return. A small fee per generation is already how some AI companies operate for this purpose, but if we could take it out of a centralized system and allow anyone to provide the service then that would be valuable to everyone and give a crypto utility that helps draw non-crypto people in. If you have a computer with a good graphics card you could do something akin to mining the currency except that no printing of the token is done since there is someone paying for their art to be generated and the computing power isn't wasted.

I'm open to criticisms of this idea or other ideas to tack onto it. I just thought it could spark a useful discussion and perhaps, if someone feels it's a good enough idea to implement, they will."|0.55|2|0|2
t3_xc1b8c|1662950916|CryptoCurrency|This is not a bear market|"Sorry, bit of a rant. Felt frustrated, might delete later. 

I don‚Äôt know why it annoys me but the current crypto market being referred to as a bear market does. 

I think Crypto holders who paid too much during a giant run up want to feel better about their huge losses. I get it. If I bought something and it halved it quartered I‚Äôd want to give it some kind of label that indicates I didn‚Äôt fuck up by buying into a crowd based trend.  

This is, at best, a correction.  A bear market is a term for a prolonged slump with prices below intrinsic or fundamental value brought on by external forces reducing demand.  This isn‚Äôt that. 

Crypto prices are down from their highs because they were really fucking high. Super overbought by wannabes suffering from serious FOMO and hype on top of hype. 

They aren‚Äôt even down that much. Ether at $1500 is arguably super inflated and far above any intrinsic value. It hung around $250 for a long time. Bitcoin at $20k is magnificently inflated from its historical prices. 

I know folks want to feel like there‚Äôs some other reason for crypto to be down besides a correction from irrational exuberance, but there isn‚Äôt one.

I bought bitcoin because blockchain is interesting tech.  But it is inefficient by design. I love distributed computing, but it has serious limitations. Cloud computing has more use cases and is more efficient. 

The pricing of bitcoin has taken it from tech to pure speculation.  It‚Äôs tulip bulbs at this point and has been for a while

Ether I bought because I read the white paper and it‚Äôs an improvement on bitcoin. It is brilliant. That‚Äôs it though. It‚Äôs a platform.  It has a few neat use cases.  But also its pricing is stupid.  Any blockchain with enough nodes can replicate the functionality.  And most of the best use cases are demonstrably not businesses but government such as titling and ownership.  

Anyway that‚Äôs my rant.  It‚Äôs not a bear market. I‚Äôm sorry you lost money.  I really am.  I tried to warn friends not to buy into the hype. But most people I know don‚Äôt even understand the tech and didn‚Äôt buy any.  I‚Äôm lucky and I bought early.  Just luck. Maybe I‚Äôm suffering from survivor bias. Don‚Äôt know, but I strongly feel this isn‚Äôt a bear market and crypto is still way overpriced.

With no lawsuits on the horizon, lets start:

I currently DJ at a club and I get paid half my cut in cash and half in bank transfer. This is because half is my usual ""wage"" and the other half is the cash they took with the ticket prices (we get it split between a few of us).

I want to swap this for crypto, but avoiding banks.

Why? Definitely to see the scalability crypto has done with these kinds of transactions and not to avoid HMRC of course (joking, it would never be enough to go above the taxable threshold).

Im a student ok.

Anyways, I want to find a way to deposit cold, hard, paper cash somewhere so I can get crypto in exchange. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether (ew, but if it has to be), Ripple (ew again), you name it.

The reasoning behind this is because I hate walking around with cash in my wallet as I got a fear of losing the wallet and losing the cash. Yes I can lose other stuff, but that can be blocked. Also, I really do not want to do it always through my bank, as I get my transactions frozen sometimes for ""security reasons"" when I deposit to exchanges and honestly it boils my blood.

t3_xbxo0j|1662940474|CryptoCurrency|Some bear market strategies I use|"What to do in a bear market, I'll give you some strategies which you can take or leave:

# Cover Your Costs

Your top priority 'should' be covering your living expenses. If you‚Äôve been counting on short-term market gains to pay the rent, you aren‚Äôt in a position to make sustainable choices as your portfolio‚Äôs value plummets.

# Diversify

In every bear market, some crypto projects get hit harder than others. Experts say a diverse portfolio can help you minimize losses and take advantage of gains in growing markets. This is the perfect moment to diversify into other coins that took a hard hit. Don't overdiversify though. I'll stick to BTC and ETH for 70-80%

# Don‚Äôt Panic

Experienced financial advisors say it‚Äôs best to take a deep breath and stay in the market. If you have funds which you can afford to lose, invest it, if not, just hold and wait, that's the best advice I can give.

## Make Recurring Buys

Smart investors weather bear markets with a strategy called dollar cost averaging. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which an investor divides up the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase.  *source:* [*https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp)

## Look Beyond Price

Price is not everything, even better, market cap is a more powerful indicator. Price can look very attractive, but don't let it fool you.

# Be Patient

Title explains.

I personally use these strategies all the time during a bear market and it works pretty good for me so I want to share it. Its the most basic ones but I feel like it must be repeated. Also mental health is most important, you cannot recover mental health or you can but it is hard. Wealth is something you can recover and rebuild. Stay strong!"|0.42|0|0|0

t3_xbs676|1662926596|CryptoCurrency|My thoughts on NFT's; their use in gaming, and their 'Value'|"All, forgive me; this is my first time trying to write anything of length on this subreddit. I'd suggest that even within this (Pro-crypto) sub, there may be many people who don't get NFT's and those who swear by them. I know a lot of people don't understand why people might want to spend 100 ETH for a 'picture of a monkey', so let me share some of my thoughts.

I'm also going to find and share some data regarding F2P(Free to play) games and my thoughts on the future.

**First, let's deal with Profile Picture NFT's**. I'm going to try and compare to a current 'real-world' scenario to hopefully better explain my thoughts.

A simple question to start. Why do people like high-value products, more 'upmarket' brands, rarer items (let's use art as an example) and the like? Some of it may be higher quality products that may last longer, but if we're talking about a handbag being $15k, a watch costing $20k its about status, isn't it. The bag does the same as a $20 bag from around the corner, and the watch does the same as my $7 Casio(in fact, I wouldn't expect my Rolex to have a backlight) It's about displaying wealth, about displaying success. It's about saying ""I'm doing well for myself, and I'd like to display that so everyone else I see knows I am, too""

In the example we'll say that you have bought yourself a watch at $20k and wear it to a friends wedding. The average amount of people at a wedding is 167(Last years data from [Weddingstats.org](https://Weddingstats.org)) Imagine you went around and showed everyone your Rolex and those 166 other people think ""wow, r/ra246 is doing well for himself. Good for him!"" It'd be a bit weird and very self-centred to go around and how everyone your watch, but, bear with me.

Now let's look at if you did have a profile picture NFT. In [this article,](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/online-friends-real-life-facebook-social-media-study-results-friendships-a8570326.html) it is stated that the average Briton has 5 close personal friends, and over 500 online friends. Suddenly, rather than spending $20k on a Rolex or Omega and be able to show it to 167 people(many of whom may not appreciate it) in a best case scenario, or 5 people you call your close friends, you can immediately display it to 500 people. From the Wedding Party, that's 3x as many people able to see your success. Or going from close friends to online friends, it's 100x more. It's 100x more people you can display your wealth and success to, and 100x more envy to feel from others, if that's what you're into.

Another example, but I'll summarise for you. Let's say you're an A-list celebrity with a huge mansion and you like to display your wealth and success with art. How many people would you invite to your mansion? Let's go crazy and say 1000 people. (It's a huge mansion, and I'd like to think I'm overestimating, as always. That's what my wife's boyfriend says, anyway.) 1000 people do display your art to. Now lets look at someone who we know is into Crypto and NFT's who might host these huge parties. Let's take the boy who says to Drop it like it's hot, and pop it like it's hot. My boy, *Snoop.* He has 20.4 million followers on Twitter. Suddenly he can share his display picture NFT with 20 million people. He doesn't have to get dressed up, he doesn't have to thing about hosting, he doesn't have to ask someone to organise food. *He doesn't even have to get out of bed.* Yet he can immediately share with 20 million people, anywhere in the world, in any time zone, of any country, in any language.

Of course, millions won't get it, millions will actively disagree with it, but that's how it is.

To many people these 'pIcTurEs of mOnKEys' might not be 'worth' 100 ETH, or $200k if they prefer, but in my eyes, ***they're worth whatever someone would pay for it.***

Some of you may have seen a comment in here from someone last week saying these Bored Apes(he said monkey pictures) are worth $10. Quite a few of us jumped straight on to him saying we'd buy any of his Bored Apes for $10 if he had any. I doubt if he had one he'd have accepted $10 from us, eh!

&amp;#x200B;

**Okay then, now NFT's in gaming. Let's go.**

Some of the biggest income-generating games in the sector are now Free to Play games, which is a master piece of an idea. Make it free to play. Get millions involved, and add micro-transactions of a couple dollars here and there. A brilliant idea; bravo game creators.

Anywho, I wonder how many people spend money on Skins; I've done it in the past. I played LoL a few years ago and I remember buying Heartseeker Vayne, I bought one for Ahri, and I remember buying one for both Caitlyn and Miss Fortune...(Writing it out, it turns out I'm a simp..) I did buy one for Gangplank, too, but I can't remember which. Oh! And Annie's Teddy Bear costume (maybe I'm a furry, too....?) Wow...how did we end up here..

Sorry, I digress. Yeah, I've bought LoL skins and you know what happened when I stopped playing? Nothing. They're in my inventory never to be used again. Now imagine if those people who bought skins were instead buying NFT's. They would truly 'own' a skin, and they would be able to be sold on. As a result, it would need to change slightly; if someone buy's a 'Second-hand' skin then they aren't buying from the creators, but much like the Reddit NFT's, a small part of the cost could go to the original creator(the creator of the game, in this case, such as Riot Games for League of Legends.

An idea I had would be to make some skins 'Time-limited', as this would then ensure that there would be a second-hand market for the items because they wouldn't be available after a certain amount of time. It would ensure that this skin would maintain it's rarity, and therefore would continue to hold a value while people are interested in it. Let's say you've used a skin for 6 months and want to change it. Now you can sell on your skin for some coin to offset the cost of your new skin. (Khajit has skins if you have coin)

I'm sure many of us played RuneScape back in the day. I started around 2005 and probably quit around 2008, 2009? I'd managed to save up for a Santa hat before I quit (first 3000 to 99 fishing, yooooo) I sold that Santa hat when I quit for 20m Coins. A) I should've held on to it as I think they're worth a Billion coins in-game now. and B) *Imagine if in-game items were NFT's.*

I'm not entirely sure where I sit right now on should the items affect gameplay and start to venture towards 'Pay-to Win', or not. I think to a degree it's fair to maintain a level-playing field where possible. On the other hand if people want to throw their money at a game to accelerate their progression then it's their choice on how they spend their money. Maybe they want to buy an item that just looks cool. Let's let them. If it's an NFT then it can be made much rarer, the supply can be realistically reduced and it will hold its value if someone wants to sell on in future.

[Here's an article on most expensive skins sold in gaming.](https://www.svg.com/134331/the-most-expensive-skins-in-gaming-history/) Maybe this has been happening for years, but then I'd say what if you were hacked and someone 'stole' this item. At least on the Blockchain you could see where it went and may have that little bit more hope of getting it back and/or someone receiving some kind of punishment. Very unlikely, I know, but it's more than you would have without the Blockchain.

Thanks for coming to my Ted-Talk; I appreciate any criticism and comments. I hope I managed to convey my thoughts in a way that's easy to understand.  I didn't expect to go on for this long, but hey, stuff happens, right. I see the strengths of NFT's but I do also understand why people don't get them. I haven't even started discussing their other use-cases. Maybe I'll come on to that another time.

t3_xbvdep|1662934318|CryptoCurrency|Where the f is coin-neutral exchange-neutral tech to accept crypto on web stores?|"Imagine this: You are a brick-and-mortar store with an online web store presence using some software like Woocommerce, Magneto, etc. And you want to take crypto. Your options are embarrassingly small.

Option 1: Use a plugin from your exchange, if they even provide one, and pay exorbitant fees. They dictate which coins you can accept and how the whole order flow works. Coinbase, for example, used to make one but then they just suddenly stopped one day.

Option 2: Use a separate plugin for each coin, which may or may not support exchanging coins from one to another, forwarding to another wallet, etc. May require storing all payments in a hot wallet, yikes!

Option 3: Don't accept crypto. This is what most stores do.

The crypto space sorely needs an exchange-neutral, coin-neutral plugin for accepting crypto on your web store. I want to accept BTC, ETH, XMR, GRC, etc it should not be hard. **Accepting crypto** ***should*** **be easier than fiat**. You don't need a bank account, you don't need identity verification, you don't need to go any complex sign-up process, transactions are confirmed nearly instantly and irreversible.

Such a plugin would:

* Take any number of coins based on payment plugins coded by that coin's dev team. You could install as many coins/plugins as you want. Those plugins could have a fee to support their development.
* Quote prices to users in the coin of their choice and convert prices automatically, adding a X% fee to transactions to cover overhead/spread. Part of this fee could be mandatory to support development of this tool.
* Automatically swap one coin to another based on your preferred coin using any number of DEXes or CEXes. Again, a DEX/CEX would make such a plugin and makes money  every time somebody uses their exchange. And adding an exchange means you can now accept ALL coins that DEX supports.
* Automatically turn crypto into fiat using a plugin from your exchange of choice. Again, they charge whatever fees they want. This is particularly important for ""print on demand"" and other kinds of business where shipping a product requires buying something, modifying it, and then sending it to the customer.
* Automatically dump coins to an external/cold storage wallet based on some set thresholds.
* You shouldn't need to run your own full node to do this.

Everybody wins if a tool like this exists. We have lived in a multi-coin economy for many years now. Where TF is the simple integration for users?

Sincerely,

A frustrated web store owner"|0.6|4|0|4

t3_xbtu3v|1662930604|CryptoCurrency|Just a couple of month's ago people were saying that mining's large energy usage is a GOOD thing, but now this subreddit is praising the Merge's huge drop in energy usage. Where is the consistency?|"In recent history, there were many posts and comment's justifying crypto's high energy usage with the idea that it encourages adoption of renewable energy sources etc etc. This was not a minority position, with many posts and comments with hundreds, if not thousands, of upvotes. I was never a fan of this argument, but that's besides the point. 

Now, the Merge is upon us and ETH's energy usage will dramatically drop. With this, many posts are claiming that this energy decrease is great. Noone, however, is suggesting that ETH's energy reduction is a BAD thing, as it will slow the adoption of renewable energy sources. This is odd, as it is surely a natural consequence of the previously cited argument. 

Could it be that the ""encouraging renewable sources"" argument was nothing more than an excuse to rationalise crypto's energy consumption, rather than a true belief? To me, that's all this argument ever seemed. 

It would be interesting to get people's opinion on this and whether ETH's energy reduction is good or bad."|0.56|9|0|9

SEC chairman Gary Gensler who is sometimes a bit bullish on crypto has now officially said that every cryptocurrency is a security ""just like stocks in a company"". Well first of all crypto usually does not have a company like entity that controls every single asset but just a foundation that has a few of those assets for themselves.

Furthermore they want to investigate every single crypto exchnage, which would certainly be hundreds or even thousands as nowadays every crypto makes their own exchnage even meme coins.

They also seem to have an active community, but that community doesn't seem to have been part of building the project as much as its investors. I'm under the impression that it's nearly entirely viable because of the VC money in the project, which leads me back to worrying about the overall decentralization, both as a project and in the tokenomics.

‚ÄúI happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock‚Äôs Siphon Life spell,‚Äù


Siphon Life was indeed removed by World of Warcraft patch 3.1.0 ‚Äî ‚ÄúSecrets of Ulduar,‚Äù the first major content patch for the Wrath of the Lich King expansion that launched in November 2008. Patch 3.1.0 rolled out April 14, 2009. Buterin was 15 years old at the time.

At the time it was nerfed out of the game, Siphon Life would transfer 15 health per 3 seconds from the target to the spellcaster, for a maximum of 30 seconds. Patch 3.1.0 replaced that with a healing effect caused by the Warlock‚Äôs Corruption spell ‚Äî they get healing equivalent to 40% of the damage done by Corruption.


‚ÄúI cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit.‚Äù

t3_xbp6qk|1662919388|CryptoCurrency|The difference between investment, ponzi and pyramid scheme.|"Until lately I wasn't aware that pyramid scheme and ponzi are fundamentally different:

**Ponzi-Scheme**

""Named after Italian businessman Charles Ponzi, the scheme *leads victims to believe that profits are coming from legitimate business activity* (e.g., product sales or successful investments), and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds."" \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme)\]

You may have heard of [Bitconnect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitconnect), that was a ponzi-like scheme. The sub dwellers of r/buttcoin are calling all of crypto a ponzi, which is simply wrong. Did someone say Bitcoin has some hidden business that grants you new ATHs? No.

[shut up and take my money: Charles Ponzi](https://preview.redd.it/dvz7rjeko9n91.jpg?width=309&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5dbdeaa2978df884c7d6c2ecb0a9194bb5aebfc)

**Pyramid scheme**

""A pyramid scheme is a business model *that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying investments or sale of products*."" \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme)\]

Money ""trickles up"" to the top. An example in the crypto world is [Forsage](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-134) (thanks to ExchangeEnough7821)

**Summary**

Does Ethereum claim it had some unknown business in the background generating wealth? Does it pay you for convincing others to buy ETH? No and no? Well, it's not a ponzi and also not a pyramid scheme.

**free fun fact**

In german, pyramid scheme is also called ""Schneeballsystem"" (snowball system). We think of the money as some snowball rolling down a hill, becoming bigger and bigger by accumulating more snow."|0.58|4|0|4

t3_xblrap|1662910895|CryptoCurrency|How to prepare for the upcoming merger|"So as some knows the merger is happening within a few days (Sep 13-15). It is expected more on the 15 side.

Due to this you might get a ton of air drops, you can't mine ETH anymore, and a few taxable events happen depending on your country.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# First thing is first:

It is expected the merger will happen sometime between the 13-15. More on the later side. So what nearly all CEX are doing is freezing buying, selling, withdrawal, and other functions. This is to prevent you from losing your crypto.

It is suggested on the 12, to simply stop using ETH and it's tokens until after the merger. What this will do is it will make sure the chances of anything going back is as low as possible. Note, I'm overkilling how long to stop using your stuff. But I'm sure most don't want to deal with a screw up.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and another thing, I might have missed something. Check the comments and DYOR before doing anything.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# When is the merge:

There is a site showing a count down clock and info around it. [https://wenmerge.com/](https://wenmerge.com/)

https://preview.redd.it/nq5d8fur19n91.png?width=1597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca74043761fe92fac0c3ee47df171c95d1440e00

Just look for that above on the page that links you to.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Air drops (GET FREE MONEY):

So this is a major one. It is known we will get several air drops to our wallet. One being ETH POW. Some being promotional stuff.

Anyways, to maximize your gains it is recommended that you to keep your ETH in your personal wallet. Keeping it on a CEX or outside of your wallet could easily cause it where you miss out on any number of air drops. 

But it should be noted some CEX are looking at crediting your account this one time. Some just for ETH POW, some other things.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why ETH POW is a big deal is unlike other air drops which has very little value. ETH POW is a 1:1.

&amp;#x200B;

# TAX:

First off, I'm not a tax person so backup anything said with one. But talking to tax people IN THE USA, what is said is if the air drop is unwanted. Then it isn't taxable. But by unwanted, you can't sell or use the coins. Sending them to another wallet in an audit could be used to say cleaning the clutter out. But it could trigger something, so even that isn't recommended.

For a CEX, you could ask the CEX to not give you the stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, if it is accepted (you will use or sell it sometime in the future). Then in the USA it is counted as income tax for the value of it at the time you got it. Then capital gains when you sell it (the difference)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# CEX holders:

As mentioned, nearly all CEX are locking the use of it during a given time period. There honestly is nothing for you to do. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Holders in your personal wallet:

Again, it is recommended after the 12 to basically stop messing with it. Most CEX and others are thinking you should be OK up to the 24 hour mark. And what I said is overkill, but again you don't want to get messed over by something going wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, unlike other things where you go from V1 to V2. With ETH you do nothing. Your coins will automatically go to V2. 

# So basically, pick a date and don't touch that wallet until the merger is over.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Miners:

Obviously you can't mine ETH after everything is done. So you need to pick if you want to mine another coin or just put all your effort into staking.

&amp;#x200B;

What some places like minerstat is doing is changing ETH configs to ETC.  This is an email I got from them.

 

## What will happen with the last payout?

Each pool handles the payouts after the merge differently, so make sure to check your pool‚Äôs website to see if and when you are eligible for payout. You can find this information in the pool‚Äôs help or announcement section. If you don‚Äôt find it, use the pool‚Äôs support as minerstat support can‚Äôt help you regarding this.  


Pool.ms will handle it as described on the help page: After PoS we're going to check the transaction fee and if the transaction fee is less than the user's balance, we will withdraw the balance to the user according to the formula balance minus the transaction fee.

## What to mine?

There are several options available to mine after ETH. Unfortunately, at this point, no one knows which option will be the most profitable. To learn about alternatives, you can read our blog post: [What to mine after ETH goes to PoS?](https://medium.com/minerstat/what-to-mine-after-ethereum-moves-to-pos-c3ba8b9175e5)  


The easiest switch for you would be to our Pool.ms ETC pool, but there are other alternatives available as well. You can find a list of pools for each coin on our coin profiles pages: [ETC pools](https://minerstat.com/coin/ETC/pools), [RVN pools](https://minerstat.com/coin/RVN/pools), [ERG pools](https://minerstat.com/coin/ERG/pools), [BEAM pools](https://minerstat.com/coin/BEAM/pools), [NEOX pools](https://minerstat.com/coin/NEOX/pools), [FLUX pools](https://minerstat.com/coin/FLUX/pools), etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2miners said

 

&gt;After the Merge, we will process one last payout to all the Ethereum pool users. It should happen in a couple of hours after Merge. It could be slightly delayed due to possible network issues. ETH was never operated using the POS consensus before. Anything could happen. A lot of cryptocurrency exchanges may suspend ETH deposits and withdrawals for the time of Merge. We use Kraken and Binance to process the payouts in BTC or NANO. Please note that the last BTC/NANO payout may be delayed until one of these crypto exchanges resumes operations with Ethereum. You don‚Äôt need to request the final payout or claim it anyhow. You don‚Äôt need to change your payout threshold too if it was too high. We will pay all the unpaid balances that are over the minimum Ethereum pool payout threshold.

 

\_\_\_\_\_\_

# What to do after:

What to do after is pretty simple. Note any changes. Your ETH balance should be 100% the same before and after. Watch gas prices. It is thought this won't 100% help with that, so keep an eye out.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

# What to do if there is a delay:

At this point I seriously doubt there will be a delay. But lets just say there will be. Simply go and do your normal thing until they fix whatever problem which caused the delay.

Again, I seriously doubt there will be anymore delays in this."|0.63|10|0|10

IMO, After-market ticket sales shouldn‚Äôt even exist. If you bought tix and can‚Äôt make it to the show, find a friend to give them to. This current system of ticket resales has created a system of highway robbery for the average concert-goer. Thanks for reading, Dismounts soap box."|0.71|37|0|37
t3_xbl81c|1662909558|CryptoCurrency|Moon obsession is bad and gives off Ponzi scheme vibes|" Few hours ago there was a post talking about potential 10$ price for Moons. A comment, defending the OP, suggested that there is no need for a use case, all it needs is hype.

Yeah, I agree, once in a while you will get great returns by gambling on a meme coin. However, getting rich by luring future investors in, while lacking an actual product is the definition of a Ponzi scheme.

If you are knowingly betting your fiat in a coin with no utility, you're not a crypto enthusiast, you're a gambler, you're one of the reasons this community gets a bad reputation.

If you cannot offer a few actual use cases of distributed ledger technology, you're not woke, you're part of the problem.

If you do not constantly try to educate yourself and you focus solely on ""how to get rich"", you're better off in a casino.

It's totally understandable that the demographic in 2022 is totally different than in 2016. But, for the love of god, every once in a while, remind yourself of the fundamentals, the value drivers, the actual use cases and the drawbacks of DLT.

Rant over. Bring me the downvotes.

Edit : yes, it was wrong to say it's a ponzi scheme. Still, it's a token with near zero intrinsic value, so at some point ""investors"" are going to get burned. Hoping for 10$ in order to take advantage of ignorant people joining the space is just bad for crypto. The same applies to Doge, Shiba and the rest shitcoins.

We see a nice 9 BTC increase from last week, nothing special happened so I don't know why the increase.  Around 9% of the traded amount in LocalBitcoin (worldwide).

LocalBitcon is the only ""exchange"" that post all its stats, it is not the most used here for sure (maybe years ago when over 2k BTC were traded weekly). Most used is Binance for sure

One BTC trades at 170,000 Bs. (bolivares). No millions anymore because a year ago six zeroes were removed from the currency by law (So it would have been 170,000,000,000 Bs.). 3rd time they done it in the last 15 years (3 zeroes in 2007, 5 zeroes in 2018 and 6 zeroes in 2021).

Yes, I understand it's hard to believe but monthly minimum wage is 16 USD (130 Bs. and exchange rate is 1:8), average wage is around 100 USD and you need around 100 USD monthly ONLY for food according to some NGO (governmet wont publish that information).

We have been using crypto since maybe 2017 when inflation hit hard (over a 1,000,000% in 2018), everything is more stable than Bolivares haha. Volume come from people getting rid of their bolivares, miners exchanged their profit (here electricity is FREE), and people sending remittances from abroad, among others uses.

Some are automaticly airdropping potential forked coins!|"As you might have heard, some are planning to fork Ethereum during / after the merge, which means there may be a new PoW (proof-of-work) blockchain with a new *PoWETH* or *ETHW*. I found some info on this sub but had to research further to find out which exchanges will grant you access to (potentially) forked PoW ETH.

# Binance

&gt;""Binance will support 'The Merge'. In case of new forked tokens, *Binance will evaluate the support for distribution and withdrawal of the forked tokens*\*\*.\*\*"" \[[announcement](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/e23a46cf2ac542cea122178bbb5e05af)\]

Meaning you will automaticly receive potential PoWETH, if they will support it; you can sell it for real ETH ;)

# Coinbase

&gt;\*""\**Should an ETH PoW fork arise following The Merge, this asset will be reviewed* with the same rigor as any other asset that is listed on our exchange. \[...\] We aim to support the Merge with the least amount of friction possible for our users ‚Äî without compromising on security."" \[[blog](https://blog.coinbase.com/the-ethereum-merge-is-coming-heres-what-you-need-to-know-5f3b3045aab2)\]

They don't answer the question if you will receive PoW ETH, so if you're planning to profit from a possible fork, coinbase might not be your choice.

# Kraken

&gt;""If the ETH PoW airdrop is supported on spot, your ETH balance in your Futures account at time of the snapshot will be included. *Your spot account would be credited based on the combined balance of your spot and futures accounts at the time of the snapshot.*"" \[[kraken support](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052734432-Ethereum-Merge-Staking-and-Trading-FAQ)\]

I'm not sure when the snapshot took or will take place, maybe Kraken Support can help. It seems like they will support PoWETH and give you an airdrop.

# Poloniex

&gt;""The Ethereum Merge is expected to be in September 2022. Poloniex was the world's first exchange to list ETH and now the first one to support potential forking of ETH with listing of two potential forked ETH tokens: ETHS &amp; ETHW."" \[[Twitter-post](https://mobile.twitter.com/Poloniex/status/1555085757450272768)\]

Supported, but not sure if you will receive an airdrop.

# OKX

&gt;""In order to support a more comprehensive multi-chain ecosystem, OKX Web3 Wallet has been actively paying attention and is ready to support the forked chain."" \[[announcement](https://www.okx.com/support/hc/en-us/articles/8342403916301-OKX-Web3-Wallet-Announcement-on-Ethereum-Network-Upgrade-and-Hard-Fork)\]

Supported, but not sure if you will get an airdrop.

# MEXC

&gt;""All ETH holders on MEXC will receive the forked assets at a 1:1 ratio when the upgrade is completed."" \[[MEXC support](https://support.mexc.com/hc/en-001/articles/9206469768857-MEXC-Supports-Ethereum-ETH-2-0-Upgrade-Lists-Potential-Hard-Fork-Tokens)\]

MEXC seems to be our friend now!

# NEXO

&gt;Based on these snapshots, *forked tokens will be distributed directly into your Nexo accounts at a 1:1 ratio* to your holdings should the network demonstrate\* healthy technical parameters, unlock significant value for our users, and comply with security standards. \[[blog](https://nexo.io/blog/the-nexo-approach-to-the-ethereum-merge#how-would-nexo-handle-a-pow-fork)\]

You will receive an airdrop if the new network is working.

# FTX

&gt;\[...\] FTX will credit users with the forked PoW ETH at a ratio of 1:1, and borrowers of ETH will be charged forked PoW ETH based on their ETH balance as of the fork snapshot that will take place before the Paris execution layer upgrade. \[[FTX help](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/9025415733396-Service-updates-for-ETH-Merge)\]

You will receive an airdrop! (Probably)

# Gate.io

&gt;""Gate.io fully supports the Ethereum Merge and the potential hard fork. It has already enabled users to swap ETH into the two potential fork tokens, ETHS and ETHW, at a 1:1 ratio.

First I should share that in my life I have never seen myself as a responsible adult until I started investing in crypto.

Every week I invest a portion of my pay check into crypto. Mainly BTC &amp; ETH but also some alts I enjoy and a very small amount into moon shots.

I have set my percentage allocations for my portfolio and DCA into my coins accordingly. I have been doing this for 6 months now.

The results have had a great effect on my life outside of crypto. Having a consistent DCA strategy has made me a more consistent and disciplined person for things that matter in my life like work, family and friends.

As someone in my late 20‚Äôs I never felt grown up until I developed this investment discipline in a sector that I love and I am grateful for this sub Reddit info and support.

Some people claim crypto has no use case. Well I found one, it has made me a better, smarter and more consistent person to the people that matter most in my life.

I love crypto."|0.81|89|0|89

t3_xbiqio|1662903298|CryptoCurrency|This is how i would steal your ETH. And this is how you protect yourself.|"The PoW-ETH team so far hasn't released an updated chainid. They claim it will be announced on the day of the fork but if they fail to do so, any transaction made on PoW-ETH could be rebroadcasted (replayed) on the PoS ETH chain.

# Now how would I steal your precious PoS ETH?

A lot of people will be looking to dump their essentially free PoW-ETH as quickly as possible before the chain fades into obscurity and the tokens become worthless.

If I were a scammer, I would first set up a swap-website that gives you insanely high amounts of other crypto for your PoW-ETH to bait you in. This site would give you something like 2 or 3 times the market-price of PoW-ETH.

After you deposit PoW-ETH into the swap site, I would give you the crypto just to make it look a little less suspicious.

Then Id replay your PoW-ETH deposit transaction on PoS ETH and by doing so, steal your real ETH straight from your wallet.

# How can you protect yourself?

1. You can either wait for confirmation that the chainid has been changed and all of the above doesn't apply anymore.
2. You can send PoW-ETH from wallet A to wallet B, then send PoS ETH from wallet A to wallet C. Wait for a couple of confirmations after which you will be able to safely transact on both chains without the risk of a replay attack happening to you."|0.6|7|0|7
t3_xbidjj|1662902341|CryptoCurrency|Crypto still isn't mainstream, will it really ever be?|"I was originally always very skeptical of Bitcoin, because it is fundamentally intrinsically worthless. It still is, however, since starting my own very small scale import/export business I'm beginning to see the (potential) value in it as a quick, instant, global, neutral means of payment. I even do accept crypto as payment and have no problem doing so. So you could say I've moderated considerably from my original skepticism.

However, it's still nowhere near the adoption levels it needs to reach to really be competitive as a means of payment, except in some niche cases. Around 95% of my customers so far have elected to pay in USD. And the 5% that did pay with crypto all did so with Coinbase, pretty much the most normie exchange out there. None knew about or how to use the lightning network, or which network their wallet was for in the case of non Bitcoin crypto. Like, pretty much they're just guys who bought their crypto on coinbase with a credit card and know how to send and receive using the basic address, and that's pretty much the extent of their knowledge. And to reiterate, this is just the 5% that paid with crypto, nevermind the other 95% who probably have never waded into these waters.

And this adoption issue is the biggest problem for Bitcoin and Crypto's future imo. Because of this, it's 2-3 times more expensive for me to convert crypto into the currency I need to purchase my goods, as opposed to converting dollar payments. So it's not cheaper at all, at least for now. Nevermind the volatility that makes it impractical to use/keep funds in for business purposes. 

So yeah, I don't know. Like I said I've personally warmed up to it a bit after long initial skepticism. But if people don't start using it more en masse for transactions, then it will remain inferior to the USD. And adoption as a means of payment is really what crypto needs to start to see, not more hodlers and pump and dumps. Anyway just my 2 cents, love to hear your guys' thoughts."|0.58|10|0|10

Think about it.|"Have you ever wondered why governments, central bankers, and economists, ... are so afraid of Bitcoin? Have you ever wondered why the World Bank, the IMF, or any other major institution keeps falsely denigrating Bitcoin?

The reason is that the very foundations of Bitcoin are embedded in its source code and cannot be manipulated by arbitrary decisions.

It is impossible to arbitrarily change the maximum supply of BTC arbitrarily. They cannot arbitrarily change the monetary policy of Bitcoin.

With Bitcoin, governments and central bankers can no longer manipulate the system. Bitcoin is truly the separation of money from the hands of the state.

And that's what scares the powerful in the current system. They are afraid of a system that gives power back to the people and gives everyone the same opportunities!

So don't be surprised to see these powerful people (falsely) denigrate Bitcoin on every possible subject. Ecology, money laundering, scams, criminal use of Bitcoin, ...

All clich√©s are used to scare the general public. The reason is that these powerful people want to avoid it at all costs so that the general public can think for themselves and finally understand that Bitcoin is our way out of a flawed and not fixable system.

A system that is fairer to the many and has the potential to change the world of the future for the better.

On your side, you have to make the only choice you can: think for yourself! Don't let others tell you what to think about Bitcoin.

Take charge of your life and do your own research on Bitcoin, money, and the economy.

Everyone who has dared to think for themselves and really dig deep into the Bitcoin issue has eventually become a Bitcoiner.

Without exception. This is clearly no accident.

While a slightly biased audience, the Reddit community has been optimistic about the release of the avatars and collections, and rightly so in my opinion. 

People love to share uniqueness with others, and we‚Äôve done it for decades. From having a rare item in games such as World of Warcraft or CSGO, an achievement title to share with a username, a display picture or skin only offered for a limited time, or even going further back to having wearables that displayed rarity or status; people take pride in sharing and showing others what they have. 

I think Reddit is an excellent example of a place where we will be able to develop this behaviour in a new way, with Non fungible tokens. We already offer flairs for a variety of reasons and proudly display them, and their addition contributes another aspect for users to exhibit rarity, success, or maybe achievements (in the future?)

Pump:

\- Ethereum will consume less energy, making it more lucrative to investors.  
\- People will be incentivized to hold Eth for staking rewards.

Crash:  
\- A lot of locked Ethereum will be unlocked, with the possibility of large investors welling  
\- Miners will no longer work on Ethereum. Mining was a billion $ industry, so it will definitely affect Ethereum.  
\- A natural Crash of ""buy the rumor, sell the news"". After the merge, many might realize that the change is not that big and sell tokens.

Since each node on the blockchain is required to store and process this information, processing times slow over time as the blockchain grows.

Going forward Saito doesn't have an EVM on L1- so it doesn't have state bloat.

Both chains Ethereum and Saito provide immutability, but Saito adds permanent on-chain L1 data storage and retrievability whereas ETH sacrifices it. And Saito has predictable market-based pricing.

I think many people would be like ""but we do want smart contracts, so if Saito runs EVMs on L2 then it has just moved this EVM state bloat problem to L2 and thus hasn't solved it.""

There's irony in ppl who advocate ETH L2 scaling thinking this - but it also isn't true

Why is L2 EVM better?

1. Putting EVMs L2 means EVMs don't need to solve the full set of problems that L1 EVMs must. a few problems that are otherwise impossible-to-solve are removed.

this's part of the ETH-world justification for why L2 networks built atop ETH are good approach.

2. A scalable L1 Saito network means the EVM doesn't need to handle the same amount of data load to provide the same services.

think: use-cases that would otherwise create EVM state like key exchanges and colored coin implementations (token trading!) can be done on L1!

3. Smart contracts can be designed to take advantage of user-signalling on the layer where users ac

A smart contract can implement state management policies like, ""we'll purge your punks IF they fall below reaping threshold AND the L1 tx that created the transfer disappears.""

4. The security of the EVM is also backed by the entire set of L1 tx flow. so the smart contract layer is massively more secure than it is possible to get if you dump the EVM on L1. also cheaper w/ fees.

Higher security at comparable cost is an objective efficiency improvement.

ETH is forced to swing a massive axe at EVM state and does not have any good solutions. See: ""we won't delete smart contracts if they haven't been touched in a year,"" and other approaches which frankly opens bloating attacks on the blockchain and is a terrible idea.

On Saito with an open market L1, EVMs can implement fine-grained pruning mechanisms that leave users in control of their data.

The EVM can see whether users really want their data to stick around because the L1 ATR(automatic transaction rebroadcast) cost *can* be a sybil protection mechanism on consumption of L2 state."|0.35|0|0|0

The first event that will have an impact is the **Monthly US Core Consumer Price Index (CPI),** this will be an important report for the overall sentiment of the stock market which of course will have an important impact on the overall investors sentiment in the cryptocurrency market as well. 

One of the positives is the last report that was presented for July 2022 last month, where we saw a 0.5% drop which could indicate a further downturn for August 2022 report: 

*The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 7.6% on a year-over-year basis in July, down from an 8.1% gain in June*

We can expect the report to be released on **Tuesday, 13th September 2022**. If we see a further downtrend on the CPI, this could mark a bullish behavior and trigger a rally and this will reflect on the cryptomarkets as well. 

The second event that will have an impact directly to the Crypto Market is the long awaited **Ethereum Merge which is scheduled on September 15th 2022.** 

The Ethereum Merge will mark an end for POW (Proof of Work) as Ethereum will make a full transition to proof-of-stake, and Ethereum Mainnet will merge with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake system. This event will reduce Ethereum's energy consumption by \~99.95% and mark an new era for the entire cryptospace. 

Per the last updates provided yesterday, the last shadow fork was completed successfully and everything seems to be ready for ultimate Merge to POS.

If you stake with RocketPool (recommended over Lido because of decentralization), then you can go to Balancer for mainnet and BeethovenX for Optimism (an L2 network).

These will allow you to provide liquidity for the trading pairs rETH/wETH.

This is also the only pool that will receive the RPL (RocketPool governance token, currently trading at about $35 USD) liquidity incentive. There will be 3500 RPL provided over the course of 2 weeks starting September 8, and another 3500 RPL released on September 22. The rewards will end September 29.

For Optimism, there will only be 400 RPL, starting 9/14 and 9/28, then ending 9/29.

Simply using Balancer, you can change the 3.6% APR with rETH alone into 11.80-28.33% APR. This doesn't include the 0.04% swap fees either!

With BeethovenX on Optimism though, you can earn up to 13.64% APR, plus a 0.04% swap fee.

If you wanna take the extra step and earn even *more* APR on top of the 10+% APR, go to [beefy.finance](https://beefy.finance), search for the Rocket-Fuel vault. Then deposit your BPT tokens from Balancer/BeethovenX, and it will automatically invest it into different pools. This will earn another 10.87% APR on top of the 3.6% from RocketPool, 11.80% from BeethovenX/Balancer, *and* the RPL liquidity incentives. And it's quite safe, compared to I don't know...

*Celsius.*

Hope this helps you squeeze out that extra APR. For more information, check out this video.

t3_xbagdt|1662875001|CryptoCurrency|The Path to Mass Adoption|"We need to start a campaign to get small and local businesses accepting crypto (stablecoin) payments.

As a business owner myself, I‚Äôve started to understand the benefit of crypto even deeper.

Here‚Äôs a few reason why local and small biz owners would benefit.

One big factor for small and local business is liquidity.

Liquidity being access to money.

Payment processors for small business are not friendly for liquidity.

Why not?

1. Processing Fees -

Most payment processors take 3% in fees  on average.

May not sound like a lot, but it definitely adds up.

Crypto would allow them to save on that fee, adding potentially 3% to their bottom line or allowing them to invest that 3% into other parts of the biz.

2. Settlement time - 

Most times payment processors don‚Äôt send the paid funds to a bank account to spend for 2-3 business days.

So if someone buys something Friday night, that money doesn‚Äôt hit the bank account until Monday more likely Tuesday or Wednesday.

Obviously w crypto their is instant settlement, so they would have access to the money instantly.

3. Their money is actually their money -

I saw a post the other day about a business owner who lost 12k to PayPal because they decided he violated a TOS and refused to tell him what he did wrong and literally kept the 12k as recovery costs or whatever. 

I‚Äôve personally had bad experience w PayPal myself, not to the same extent.

I‚Äôve also had my bank accounts be shut down for no reason out of the blue after being in good standing for over a year.

They refused to tell me what I did wrong.

They said they had the ability to close accounts for ‚Äúany reason or no reason at all‚Äù.

This really fucked with my liquidity and I had to leave money sitting on stripe for an extended period because I couldn‚Äôt open another account now that I got closed out of that one, I still haven‚Äôt got a traditional bank account open, I had to open a fully digital neo bank account.

With crypto, no one has dominion over your money to fuck w this shit.

Once businesses start accepting it, we don‚Äôt have to worry about on/off ramping, cause it can all be on chain.

It will be a beautiful thing.

One big thing we need to do is remove the barrier to entry for wallets.

Meaning no hard wallets, no seed phrases, and also no 3rd party risk (trust your keys w someone)

MPC wallet tech will help us do that.

Once we that knocked out, we can get companies to do payroll w crypto and really streamline it all. 

So next time you‚Äôre at a local/small business, bring up those 3 points I made and see if you can‚Äôt help them set up a wallet and pay with a stablecoin like USDC.

Arbitrum USDC would be ideal.

Pennies to transfer and quick/reliable.

USDC does expose you to some risk, but unlikely they are as strict as payment processors."|0.6|4|0|4

Today I wanted to talk about what constitutes a projects growth and market capitalization. We see a variety of projects in the top 10, 50 and 100 and each of them seem to be either fairly similar, completely different or specialize in niche areas eg; Monero privacy, chainlink oracles.

I‚Äôm just wondering what you guys think drives a projects marketcap up?

Is it hype?
Developer activity?
Working dapps? 
Community?
Marketing?
User activity?
Memes?
Tokenomics?

I acknowledge that marketcap growth is due to a number of these in combination with each other. However, what I‚Äôm asking is do you think one is more important than the other?

Who is the most to blame for the current state of the market, 3AC or Do Kwon? Because both are inter-connected.

\#1 Do Kwon:

3AC was apparently using Ankor and UST a lot with their juicy 19% APY, they didn't seem to have much revenue with the UST interest, it seems that they died once UST collapsed.

\#2 3AC:

Even last week, I've heard about some unknown exchange halting withdrawal and they had exposure to 3AC. I laugh every time I hear it. EVERYONE gave money to 3AC. Sadly, my grandma past away about 15 years ago, but I wouldn't surprise if she was exposed to those crooks.

&amp;#x200B;

My verdict:

I blame 3AC all the way. UST/Luna debacle was big, very big, but the shit show that was 3AC had more collateral victims, to my opinion.

[Fed and Canada Central bank balance sheet vs Bitcoin price](https://preview.redd.it/olsdiue5y4n91.png?width=1542&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20bdf0dbba9046d99ff9ba79c844caacde1ae8f8)

Now that we are clearly over QE3 and entering quantitative tightening, which really only happened once in the history of btc, what can we expect?

Quantitative easing pushes more money into the system and some of it ends up in the most risky asset out there, crypto. Quantitative Tightening does the opposite, it drains the global financial system of assets. This fits nicely with the narrative that crypto is at the tip of global liquidity system as central bank policy really only flipped hawkish last November, around the peak in BTC and ETH. 

Until the Fed starts increasing the size of its balance sheet, I think its a negative signal for bitcoin and crypto. But even in the last period of QT which ended in 2019, BTC bottomed before the Fed starting increasing its Balance sheet size, so it may be already priced in. What's your take?"|0.64|4|0|4

What I have learned over the years is that you can judge a technology by starting comparing your as-is state against the state of the art. Usually when I am instructed to analyse technology within any product or process, I start by defining metrics by how I can judge whether the tech is ""Ok"" or ""nOk"". The most common metrics are price, maintnaince costs, integration costs, available space by not reducing overall performance of the underlying system. Usually I give an additional rough summery to the ""Technology Readiness Level"" and the trust level of all publicized sources. So I will try here to apply a metric onto traditional centralized platforms and to one decentralized platform, here the Dex 1Inch using the Polygon network. The use-case is trading BTC/$.

**Metric**

I have been trading stocks for over 10 years now and came to use many platforms. Usually nowadays the fees on banks are around 1-5$ per trade. I do not know all fees, but keep in mind that usually the cheaper the trading fees the higher the withdrawel and maintnance fees on the centralized platform.

So how would we make a comparable metric of these centralized systems to a dezentralized system? For me personal I do have trust in banks, but I do not have as much trust in eg. Binance or FTX. Both are centralized fintec-companies, but the safety aspects of your assets must nevertheless be taken into account somehow. So I would assume that you will have to withdraw your assets from eg. Binance after every 10 trades, but could leave those assets on a trustworthy bank account for an unlimited time since the trustlevel of a bank is just higher compared to fintec companies (yeah I know crypto bros, banks suck! I am with you! But still I dont think my bank will lock me out in the foreseeable future...).

**Review of traditional platforms like Banks:** 

Ing-Diba Bank charges 4.99$, no withdrawel fees in Europe and about 2.00$ monthly maintenance costs. Immediate transfers within a couple of seconds cost an addititional 1.00$, normal transfers take 12 working hrs and are for free. Most other banks in Germany charge even more like the Deutsche Bank and Comdirect Bank. (10 trades + maintnance)/10 = 52.00$ on traditional banking platforms.

1 BTC-trade = 5.20$

**Review of Fin-Tech-Platforms like Binance, FTX and Robinhood etc.**

FTX, last time I checked, charged 25.00$ for withdrawing cash in Europe via SEPA-Transactions, but is a lot cheaper on the trading fees. The same applies for Robinhood with varying fees on trades and withdrawals.

Binance trading BTC is for free, but eg. withdrawing BTC to a cold wallet costs you 0.0002BTC = 20.000$/BTC\*0.0002BTC = 4$. Since the Binance BTC trades are for free I would just have to pay the withdrawal fees for every 10 trades eg. 10 x $ =&gt; BTC conversions, leaving 4$ BTC-withdrawal fees dvided by 10 equates to 0.40$ per trade on Fintech.

1 BTC-trade = 0.04$

**Review of a decentralized exchange 1Inch used on Polygon Network**

A Trade of BTC on the 1Inch platform on the Polygon Network costs 0.03 Matic or less than 0.03$. These Platforms have no hidden costs or maintenance fees. Withdrawing fees to a cold storage are 0.00077 Matic or less than 0.0007$. 10 Trades + withdrawal to trustful cold storage would cost you thus 10\*0.03$ + 0.0007$ = 0.3007$. I use hot wallets for trading and cold storage for long term since hot wallets are just more convenient. You could argue that the withdrawing fee is not needed if you trust your hot wallet.

1 BTC-trade = 0.03007$

**Summery and Conclusion**

I tried to set up a metric in order to evaluate and compare banks, fintec and dexes. This metric measured overall costs and tried to assess and include safety aspects into it by taking the withdrawal fees to a safe haven into account.

Banks are 17,292.00% (you read correctly: seventeen thousand!!!) times more expensive than decentralized platforms. Fintech is only 33.00% more expensive than a decentralized platforms.

It is the authors opinion by looking at these metrics that the classical banking system will not survive the decades to come. All it needs is a single sufficiently large disturbance withing the current financial system and the evolutionary advantage of decentralized technology will completely crush all traditional companies. The Technology Readiness Level is between 7 and 8, 9 being the highest and system in opertaion level (check wiki for further information on TRL). Once the BTC-trade applies for other assets eg. stocks, commodities etc., the TRL will go up to 9.

PreSend is the first multi-chain, fully integrated wallet software to assume the burden and responsibility of ensuring that funds transferred across the blockchain arrive successfully at the benefactor‚Äôs wallet address (on the correct blockchains), while also stopping transactions that are sent on incorrect chains.

¬†

## TLDR:

* PreSend protects cryptocurrency MetaMask wallet users from losing money if they transfer tokens to unsupported blockchain ecosystems, unsupported coins in wallets, and/or incorrect/invalid wallet addresses.
* PreSend is a MM plug-in, is **read only** and it's made on MMs only approved development platform called snaps.
* **PreSend eliminates the need for ‚Äòtest transactions‚Äô** by verifying the recipient address and chain of the transaction; no more ‚Äòfat fingering‚Äô the actual transaction if you‚Äôre in a rush, even after doing a test transaction! FYI, this all happens in MICRO-SECONDS! Efficiency *is* PreSend!
* **Ready to use right now** with MetaMask: [http://app.presend.io/](http://app.presend.io/) \- Chrome extension to release in late September/early October

# Why is PreSend useful? When would I use it?

Using automated technology, PreSend verifies:

* The recipient wallet address; does it exist?
* If the wallet can accept the coin/token being transferred
* The chain selected for the transaction;
   * USDT is on ETH and TRON
   * Did you pick the right chain?
* If any of the above ends up being incorrect, then PreSend steps in to block the transaction, preventing the loss of that crypto forever! The transaction never even goes through.
* **'Test transactions' confirm an address is live, but do not protect your subsequent transactions** ( especially if the address is not saved or added to your address book); *rushing* or '*fat-fingering*' the address could cost you $100s, if not $1,000s if the address is incorrect or worse, changed by clipboard 'crypto-malware' at the last second.

# Roadmap:

## Wallet integrations:

* Add Binance Wallet:
* We can integrate with the Public Facing API on Binance, which would allow PreSend to check any funds that were sent out of or into Binance.
* This will allow us to see the full picture of transactions from the outside (PreSend) and the inside (Binance).
* This could allow us to do a licensing deal with Binance as well in the future for PreSend software.
* Add Coinbase Wallet:
* We can integrate with the Public Facing API on Coinbase, which would allow PreSend to check any funds that were sent out of or into Coinbase.
* This will allow us to see the full picture of transactions from the outside (PreSend) and the inside (Coinbase).
* This could allow us to do a licensing deal with Coinbase as well in the future for PreSend software.

## Functionality:

* Notify wallet of user/permission changes (functionality to be built in), to help prevent phishing attacks / malicious links / etcetera.
* Optimize gas/transaction fees on tracer transaction, to save users money on transaction fees
* Honeypot detection
* Notify wallet user of recipient wallet address changes on DEXs prior to sending a transaction (preventing sending coins to a scammer wallet)
* Integrate signer/receiver transactions for larger transactions that need secondary verification from the recipient wallet.
* Integrate Rubic Swap:
* Rubic is a Cross-Chain Decentralized Exchange that allows users to swap tokens from one chain to another.
* With this integration users can swap tokens/coins from chain to chain seamlessly through the chrome extension in PreSend.
* For example: you have USDC on Polygon chain and wish to convert it over to Ethereum chain, this makes that transaction seamless and the simple click of a button.

## Partnerships:

* **We are partnered with CHAINLINK.**
* Chainlink is automating our snapshotting and airdropping process.
* Partner With FLUX in the future
* The PreSend software is actually built on FLUX.
* We wish to promote and integrate into their decentralized Web3 ecosystem (promoting mass adoption of PreSend).
* Partner With Gnosis in the future
* This is all about safety.
* Gnosis offers multi-signature wallets and vaults.
* A partnership with Gnosis would be to promote and encourage proper crypto safety protocols and practices.
* Create Crypto Safety Council
* This will be to educate the cryptocurrency market participants on proper crypto safety procedures, protocols, and best practices.
* Partner With Rubic in the future
* Rubic is a Cross-Chain Decentralized Exchange that allows users to swap tokens from one chain to another.
* With this integration users can swap tokens/coins from chain to chain seamlessly through the chrome extension in PreSend.
* This will be a mutually beneficial business relationship for both parties involved.
* Partner With KD Launch in the future
* This is a Kadena LaunchPad.
* This is a part of the FLUX ecosystem (targeting mass adoption for PreSend).
* A massive part of their protocol is promoting utility projects and safety protocols, also giving us exposure to the Kadena ecosystem for future launches, mass adoption, and potential projects.

## Audits:

* If there is a smart contract implemented at any time, then PreSend will be performing a Solidity audit on said smart contract once the software has implemented the smart contract and is 100% complete and fully functional.
* PreSend may also do a secondary audit once the Solidity audit is 100% complete.

## Patents:

* Although PreSend is fully functional on the website RIGHT NOW, PreSend will be filing for the full patent once the software is 100% functional in the Chrome Extension version (the one that is ""set it and forget it"" and runs in the background), likely in the next 4-8 weeks (September/October of 2022).
* This is due to the fact that if you change any functionality in the original software before it is complete, a new patent must be filed, so for efficiency and cost purposes the FULL patent will be filed upon completion and testing of the functionality of the PreSend software.
* We have patented our technique for facilitating the safe transaction of cryptocurrencies. The patent was filled on the 25th of June by Patent Attorney John Crosby, provisionally, and is available for viewing in our marketing packet.
* The provisional patent protects from any other entity coming in and copying the proprietary nature of this software, idea, functionality, etcetera. This provisional patent is our safeguard and is set in stone.
* A secondary provisional patent was filed after we added other integrations such as honey pot detection and scammer detection to our wallet.

# What about the company/team?

* Fully doxed and documented team
* LLC registered in America

To that end, here is an interesting Twitter thread from @OlimpioCrypto that explains it clearly:

https://twitter.com/OlimpioCrypto/status/1557751718905090048

Now, the ETH PoW devs are planning on changing the chainid to prevent replay-attacks from happening, but they haven't done it yet and the Merge is coming too soon to ignore the risks.

At this stage, even Coinbase is worried about the state of the PoW fork: https://github.com/ethereumpow/go-ethereum/pull/17

t3_xb2c7a|1662850037|CryptoCurrency|So I Did a Research About Solana Ecosystem|"Here are my findings;

Solana have around 1977 active validators and 282 delinquent validators which means they are punished and not earning any rewards.

|Active Validators|1977|
|:-|:-|
|Delinquent Validators (Punished)|282|

413.7M SOL Staked which is approximately $14.5B and Coinbase Cloud is top validator with 2% stake.

Client diversity seems good since %83 of the clients are up to date.

Here is the troubling part: **Data Center Concentration**.

Validators with most voting power are concentrated in Equinix, Hetzner and Amazon with total of %58 of voting power. If these three hosting provider decide to remove all validators or ban them then Solana network will lost its %58 voting power.

First, lets make a quick chart anal about Bull &amp; Bear Trend.

As you (might) know, each of the scenarios have higher/lower checkpoints and what makes a Bull or Bear market is the \*CONSISTENSY\* of this trend for a long period of time. Of course it might go in the wrong direction but generally, it doesn't move too far from the trend and it is quite brief, continuing the market trend.

Let's take a look at ETH chart over the last year:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pgpy7ajmo3n91.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=594c0348614750ee266562404ee41e68b1411b13

Here is BTC as well:

https://preview.redd.it/m18auifpr3n91.png?width=937&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b35fb71ba8fe8bef9e244835bce69397d44a09e7

You can clearly see the Bear market but at the end of it, what looks like the begining of a bull market (i assume the merge hype). BUT, even during this down trend, it has random pumps of VOLUME, showing life.

Different from this chart, projects that ""might die"" look very different, let's take a look at FANTOM chart:

https://preview.redd.it/9e2ojxo9o3n91.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e81f5c09c7a76ea46c6123f8e38baf43108caca4

As you can see, after the Bear hits, it looks completely dead with no meaningful volume pumps during down trend. That's a Bad sign.

(I chose FANTOM randomly between the various ""dead coins"" avaliable, no special reason).

&amp;#x200B;

Other factors that might show a dead projecto (Overall, lack of interest):

1 - Lack of community activity:

2 - Lack of project mention on forums/discussions;

3 -  Lack of updates from the developers.

So of your coin is not talked about, doens't have any mentions or development, you probabily need to bail.

Of course, Crypto market is wild af and some unexpected stuff can happen, just look what LUNA."|0.62|5|0|5
t3_xb14lx|1662846842|CryptoCurrency|Serious question- What is the value proposition Luna/Luna Classic is saying it has?|"I am thoroughly confused as to why LUNA and LUNC is pumping, not because people buy into hype and shilled projects, but because I don‚Äôt understand what problem the developers and shillers are saying LUNA can solve. 

I know months ago, the argument was LUNA has value because it is used algorithmically with UST, and (marketing words, not mine) because UST is such a novel idea and great product, LUNA also has value. 

However, right now I can‚Äôt understand what the value is right now. Literally from LUNC‚Äôs cmc description of what makes it unique 

&gt; Terra seeks to set itself apart through its use of fiat-pegged stablecoins, stating that it combines the borderless benefits of cryptocurrencies with the day-to-day price stability of fiat currencies. It keeps its one-to-one peg through an algorithm that automatically adjusts stablecoin supply based on its demand. 

However, UST isn‚Äôt pegged. 

For LUNA, the only reason to buy that is given is that developers are building dApps on it. Literally one of the reasons I read for ‚Äúwhy should I buy LUNA‚Äù was 

&gt;‚ÄùDetermination. The large existing Luna holder base who lost funds in the Terra Luna and UST collapse will continue to receive new Terra Luna tokens over the next two years. Many disaffected investors are intent on regaining their losses ‚Äì some of which totalled over six figures. These investors will be bullish on Luna projects and willing to hold onto tokens until prices are positive for selling.‚Äù

I honestly would understand it more if the reasoning was LUNA/LUNC is a meme coin now and it‚Äôs funny to buy. That‚Äôs at least a better reason than, ‚Äúit has a burn tax.‚Äù

t3_xazxr4|1662843665|CryptoCurrency|Why you should stake? Because of The power of compound interest!!!|"Hey guys,

I've recently found out that a lot of ppl do not understand to compound interest, so something like 5% from staking may look like nothing to them. At first - still better than saving accounts in most of countries (in some countries they have negative interest on saving accounts above certain amount, which is ridiculous) and also if you understand to it, than you will also understand how to slowly build wealth:). So let's look at it...

**What is Compound interest?**

Simply said - it's interest on interest. Basically when you put some money to saving account, you get some APY (appreciation per year) and after certain amount of time (usually a month), you get back your money + something extra. Simple, right? And if you take that sum of money INCLUDING money you gained last time, put it again to that saving account with same APY you will get more, because you are now saving your initial investment + money you've gained during first time. That's all...and it's an amazing snowball effect, because this interest is slowly getting bigger and bigger. Let's have a look at numbers.

This is a ""basic example"" - you are putting ito your savings 100 dollars every month and APY 5%, so 1 200 a year, every year. As you can see on table bellow, after 15 years you will have enough, to start withdrawing 100 bucks every month FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, because you will already have there enough, to generate you passive income of almost 1 300 dollars per year. I know, it takes years, but it¬¥s not that much and actually when you think about it...because you were saving these 100 bucks every month, you got used to it, so now, when you will start withdrawing 100 every month and stop saving another 100, that means you have extra 200 bucks every month:) (as long as you are still working...)

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you get it a bit. Now let¬¥s have a look at average APY 10%, which is more less average return of stock index S&amp;P 500. As you can see, you are already at the same point in something like 7,5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ce9saglai3n91.png?width=340&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92c61fe4760a579e4b26132dd5491c3d574b3f41

And now to put it into crypto perspective, which is a main point of this post. We have staking rewards, which in some cases does not look like a lot (mainly when we consider these regular moonshots). Initially I¬¥ve wanted to make a table with number of coins instead of value, but there is a catch - since markets are moving so fast, it¬¥s almost impossible to predict price movements, so I¬¥ve just left it in FIAT and did not even counted in price growth (which, as we know, is a huuuge factor). So consider for a while that crypto markets are frozen for next 10 years and that you are just staking with APY from specific projects. I would say it¬¥s pretty impressive:). You won¬¥t be a milionaire over night, but still you can make quite a bit along the way and the most important thing - It¬¥s passive income, so you¬¥ve made it while you were sitting on couch and shitposting on Reddit:).

**Conclusion:**

Hope it does not offend anyone, but since I found recently, that most of young guys around don¬¥t know a thing about this (we recently hired two young guys to work at our construction site and I was quite amazed that they don¬¥t know basic things like this...but they are both throwing money into Doge since it reached top, full of hopium that it will one day reach 1000 bucks (already explained them, that it won¬¥t happen:D ). It¬¥s just a snowball effect - more you have, more you earn. That¬¥s it...simple as that and if you want to build real wealth, you just have to work on your passive income:).

P.S.: *This is a repost (I already posted it 2 times and it looks like it¬¥s still a good idea to remind new members about it and even more important when markets are behaving like...like right now). I wrote this post some time ago, but since there was quite a few posts related to staking, I've thought it might be a good idea to repost it just to show, that staking has a sense:). Also this is just a really simplified example, so without inflation, so you have to take into account average 2-3% inflation + crypto potential (from -100% to +unlimited% )*"|0.6|5|0|5

During this period, I have fallen in love with crypto and with its potential use-cases. I think I learned a lot about all aspects of my crypto journey.

The thing I struggle with the most is to research the quality of a project. **Based on the view of this sub, I should not:**

* listen to the advice of this sub.
* listen to the advice of any person on Youtube or Twitter.
* do any kind of technical analysis to predict price action because that is astrology.

But I am supposed to do my research. Then *how* should I be doing this research? What I can think of that I should do:

* Read the white paper - but, uh, this is very technical and long and therefore difficult to read. The white paper of link is 136 pages, for instance.
* Check the website - but this is not an independent source of information. I can get valuable information here, such as what the token does, who is on the team, and its tokenomics. But even that is sometimes just not accurate and I find it difficult to judge it, particularly when projects are new. But it helps.
* Read posts on news websites? But these are mostly superficial and short and rarely just focus on a project.

So, long story short, how should one do research on the quality and promise a project (knowing that time is limited)? Do you have some good strategies or resources to share? **Serious answers only please. I hope this can become a source of information for newer people.**"|0.74|13|0|13

1. ‚ÄúThe majority of Bitcoin mining is from renewable sources‚Äù

The source for this is the survey from the Bitcoin mining council. Did anyone of you listen in on the very first BMC meeting? I did. When Saylor was announcing the survey they want to carry out a miner sheepishly asked ‚ÄúAre we obliged to report?‚Äù And he was told no, it‚Äôs totally voluntary ‚Ä¶. See the bias??

2. ‚ÄúBitcoin uses less than x% of the worlds energy. Banking uses more‚Äù

Firstly for such a small niche thing to use so much energy is already outrageous. Based on market cap, the Bitcoin industry is ~6% the size of the gold industry, and around 0.16% of the the size of the banking industry. If Bitcoin is using this much energy while it is still tiny, how much will it use when it‚Äôs on par with the banking industry?


3. ‚ÄúA Bitcoin ban is bad.‚Äù And ‚ÄúBitcoin can‚Äôt be banned‚Äù Some of these people are seriously bi-polar. If BTC can‚Äôt be banned then why are you concerned about a ban?

t3_xat5ae|1662826288|CryptoCurrency|The strategies I‚Äôve been using this bear market: Yield Farming, Liquidity Mining (and Their Risks)|" In this guide I will explain the different strategies I am using during this bear market to accumulate crypto.

It is considerably simpler than timing the market (you know, buying low and selling high, which usually ends up in reverse).

You can learn all the techniques, advantages, and disadvantages of yield farming from this guide.

**Yield Farming?**

Yield farming is the first way to accumulate more crypto. The process goes like this: you provide a pair of tokens to a **Liquidity Pool (see below)** of a decentralized exchange (DEX), so it can operate. That DEX will pay you interest on the liquidity that you have provided which comes mainly from its customers' fees for certain transactions like borrowing, swapping coins/tokens, and trading.

The fees charged to the customers are given to liquidity providers. Yes, you will receive free tokens if you provide your tokens to a DEX.

Furthermore, you can choose to reinvest their profits to gain even more yield. Reinvesting your gains will compound the interest you‚Äôre getting, at which point yield farming can become very profitable. If you reinvest your earnings, having initially invested x amount of crypto, investments results would look like this: 

***(Initial investment + interest paid on initial investment) √ó interest paid = your yield***

**What is a Liquidity Pool?**

To provide liquidity to a DEX you will have to add a pair of tokens to a liquidity pool. For example, if you provide 1700$ worth of ETH (1 ETH) and 1700$ worth of DAI (1700 DAI) to an exchange, this will allow the DEX customers to swap their ETH for DAI and vice versa. They will pay a fee each time they swap tokens, which will be paid to you. This way you keep accumulating more ETH and WBTC while waiting for the next bull market.

A smart contract used in a liquidity protocol will hold the funds you added in the liquidity pool and giving you the rewards. This contract will ensure that only you can withdraw the ETH and WBTC you provided in the first place, whenever you need to.

**Bear in mind that the tokens in you provided to the pool will still gain or lose value as they would do if you just held them in your wallet**. 

**Risks of Yield Farming**

**- Impermanent loss**

One risk that is exclusive to yield farming and liquidity mining is impermanent loss.

So now we know how liquidity providers make an earning in a perfect scenario where prices are a peaceful candlestick. Unfortunately, volatility is a part of life in the crypto realm, and prices change often.

Impermanent loss happens when the price of your token changes after you deposit it in the liquidity pool.

From the above example, in a bullish market if the price of ETH goes up to $2000, you‚Äôll now be looking at a 1 ETH per 2000 DAI exchange rate.

At this point, you‚Äôll realize had you held on to your 1 ETH and 1700 DAI, 

you would have had $4000, meaning $600 in profit. But since you‚Äôve deposited it into the liquidity pool, the liquidity pool will sell part of your ETH for DAI to ‚Äúrebalance‚Äù the pool, so there will always be the same amount of both ETH and DAI (expressed in dollars). You will make Money, but not as much as if you just held those tokens in a wallet.

The good news is that in a bear market, when coin prices tend to decrease, the yield obtained with pairing a coin with a variable price (like ETH) with a stable coin (like DAI) will protect you against price decrease.

\- **Hackers and Rugpulls**

The highest risk in investing in a decentralized exchange is malicious hackers gaining access to cryptocurrencies and stealing them. While DEXs often have advanced security features, they need time to work out bugs and unfortunately, many adventurous users tend to fall victim to undetected design flaws. Use only Decentralized Exchanges that are proven over time, such as Uniswap."|0.4|0|0|0

t3_xasumd|1662825561|CryptoCurrency|Proof of useful Work is the future of PoW. Every PoW chain that will not switch to it in the long term, will die.|"Crypto, outside the crypto-bubble, has a massive image problem. One of the biggest contributors to that problem is Proof of Work.

You can explain all day long how it's actually important for the security of the network to use that much energy. A big chunk of people will just see millions of computers solving puzzles only for one to be first and for the rest to ""waste"" terawatts of energy.Another problem of PoW is pretty simple - PoS works. The biggest stresstest for Proof of Stake will happen with the merge, but we already see big chains working just fine with it for years. For anyone with rudimental knowledge of crypto the situation is pretty simple: Here is Bitcoin using energy of a midsize country in a time of unprecedented energy crisis and on the other side is every other major chain doing ""better"" or same things (on the surface), but only using a minuscule fraction of the energy.

In the long term I see only one way for PoW chains to survive - a switch to Proof of Usefull Work. I know that it is basically a different consensus mechanism and it's is not as easy as flipping a switch. PouW needs to be tested, there are important questions to answer. What work is ""useful""? How to decide who benefits from the computing power? Can the network be secure?

But can you imagine the undeniable benefit of Proof of useful Work? If Bitcoin switches to it, humanity will get the biggest supercomputer ever designed. A worldwide network that tackles the biggest challenges of humanity with unprecedented power. The system would also be inherently ASIC-resistant, because the specific kind of computing work would be diverse or could change depending on the need. This would probably decentralize the network even more.

In the next years we will see PouW emerge and different consensus mechanisms tested. If they succeed, the pressure on every PoW chain to change will become immense. I think that even within the community it will become increasingly harder to defend massive energy spending just for the sake  of energy spending.  


Edit:  
Proof of useful Work means that the computing power is used for real life problems instead of solving algorithmic puzzles. Could be research or AI for example."|0.29|0|0|0

How can this major and yet simple mistake even happen? How can they just rush things like this, there are so money at stake!

So many projects in the cryptoverse rushes their development without double checking the most simple things or people are too impatient:

Remember this one SOL lending protocol which lost 6M in funds just because the devs were impatient and shut down the program which was slow laoding?

Other projects don't even run testnets to try out thing, but instead launch their chains at once.

Bridged assets, yeah we have them, too! How many bridged coins had already been lost to some hacks/exploits which are knowns long ago (yes, look at the Harmony one Horizon bridge and some others)

Stable coin, yep we also have then on our chain...no need to comment more on this. How many stables had depegged to zero...a lot!

t3_xarxs5|1662823214|CryptoCurrency|Hopium and a hot take: Five reasons why the bottom is in and why we are going to rally soon|"This is a controversial take, but I believe that the BTC bottom is in and that we are seeing the start of a new rally. I have no strong views on whether this assumed rally is a dead cat bounce (*similar to what happened in previous bear markets where everytime the price of BTC was down by 70%, we saw a 100%+ rally*) or whether the cycle bottom is in. But in my opinion we are going up significantly from hereon. Why?

**1) (Almost) every bottom indicators flashed**

Whether it is the Pi Cycle indicator, the Hash Ribbons indicator, the Puell Multiple indicator, or even the memey but often correct rainbow chart, they basically all agree on one thing: we have bottomed. An example here is the RSI weekly chart. RSI is the relative strength index, which reflects the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions. Bitcoin always bounces when we hit the oversold areas. its doing it again now.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) The DXY is losing its parabolic trend**

There is a strong negative relationship between the strength of the DXY and the price of Bitcoin. This is a very well established correlation, please google it for more info. For clarity, the DXY is the US Dollar Index and reflects the strength of the Dollar relative to a bunch of foreign currencies. The parabolia is likely to end as there is massive bearish divergence on all timeframes, even on the weekly timeframe, with the DXY making higher highs and RSI making lower highs. This typically is a strong signal for downside and any strong move down has always caused BTC to move up.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) This is the first 3-day bullish divergence since the start of the massive rally in 2021**

In May 2021, there was a clear bullish divergence on the 3-day chart, with price moving down and RSI moving up. This helped to give enough confidence to the market that we are ready to move up. The same thing is happening now and it is likely that this bullish divergence just got confirmed. See here:

[Bullish divergence \(orange line below\) on the 3-day Bitcoin chart \(Source: CryptoWorldJosh\)](https://preview.redd.it/1in3l8qwo1n91.png?width=1628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b29d8ea391617767addb746516bed28fbea70e2)

**4) BTC Dominance is low and acting different than in other bear markets**

Traditionally in bear markets, the dominance of Bitcoin relative to the alts sees a rapid increase, with alts bleeding out. The opposite has happened now, with BTC losing ground against the alts in terms of market cap. This has caught many off guard. Based on the altcoin season index, we are even in an altcoin season, with 96% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last 90 days. 

If the confidence was gone in the market, we would see the opposite pattern with alts losing market cap relative to BTC. Any improvements in the macro environment will help us move up fast. Adoption has never been better and a lot of institutional money is still flowing in this space - this could have very well been the fifth point.

**5) The fifth Elliott Wave is missing**

I will put myself out there because many here are critical of any technical analysis. But in my view, we are missing a blow off top that typically markts the end, the fifth Elliott Wave. Elliott Wave theory is a form of technical analysis that looks for recurrent long-term price patterns related to persistent changes in investor sentiment and psychology. The theory identifies impulse waves that set up a pattern and corrective waves that oppose the larger trend. Typically, an impulse has 5 waves, that follow strict rules (e.g., wave 4 cannot go below wave 1; wave 3 cannot be the shortest). Many traders use this method of analysis and on larger timeframes in particular it is usually successful.

I think that there are many reasons why the bottom is in. This is my attempt at a bit more of a serious content on this sub that could feed into meaningful discussion.

t3_xar8sp|1662821420|CryptoCurrency|An overview of NEAR Protocol's roadmap and how it plans to achieve sustainable scalability, a high number of validator seats and very low hardware requirements|"**Near has one of the most unique architectures in this space and is built with usability and sustainability in mind but like pretty much everything else, it's still in development.**

A tldr on how it works is that it's a sharded blockchain but unlike classic designs such as Polkadot or Harmony, it shards blocks instead of chains and therefore significantly reduces complexity, allowing cross shard transaction with only one second delay and making shards invisible for users and developers. At all times there is only one chain being built in the system, and different sets of validators build different parts (chunks is the technical term for it) of it.

**Where are we now?**

We are currently in Phase 0 out of 4 of the sharding rollout.

Phase 0 of Nightshade (Near's sharding design) contains full state sharding and has a total number of 4 shards. In this phase all block producers track and verify all shards and each one of them performs exactly the same tasks as everyone else. In this phase the network only allows a small number of validators - 100.

**What's coming in the following months?**

**Phase 1** is about to go live in a few weeks after extensive testing with real world infrastructure providers on incentivized testnets this summer.

This phase will introduce a new validator type: chunk only producers. A chunk only producer only tracks a single shard, uses mininmal resources and is responsible for collecting transactions in its respective shard, building and packaging them to be added in blocks as chunks.

All validators' hardware requirements will decrease and the number of validator seats will increase by up to 400.

**Phase 2 of Nightshade**

Phase 2 will see the introduction of challenges. A cryptographic mechanism that allows fishermen and honest validators to prove incorrect state transitions provided by malicious chunk producers to the rest of the network.

All validators' hardware requirements will further decrease and no block producer will be required to track every single shard to ensure no invalid state transitions are being applied in the system. The network can rely on cryptographic proofs and a 1/n honesty assumption.

The number of validators will be able to grow linearly with the network usage, since it will allow for the first time the creation of more shards, opening up more validator seats. The more usage the network gets, the more decentralized it becomes, potentially reaching even tens of thousands of validators.

**The final stage - phase 3**

Phase 3 will allow the network to split and merge its shards based on utilization automatically, basically solving scalability once and for all. The more usage an account or a contract gets, the more it gets isolated into its own shard, allowing hyper-popular dapps to have the capacity of an entire monolithic L1 just for themselves with 0 developer intervention.

This part is specifically interesting if you think of rollups, a rollup contract on a monolithic L1 like the current Ethereum already has decent capacity, but a single rollup contract on an entire shard of its own is on a whole different level."|0.63|4|0|4

2. Think I'm trying to FUD their coin/project of choice. -- like seriously, waaaay more than feels reasonable on this end


3. Sometimes be reasonable and say, yeah, everything is up. I'm glad you took some profits for when things go back down. --I LOVE these voices of reason

- Pick a level of profit: 50% 2x 3x etc
- pick the amount to sell to at least get back your initial plus some 
- wait until it's close enough to set a limit order (if you can)
- or if it's defi, as soon as it's hit the goal, Pull the trigger.

Will they airdrop you ETH 2 or will they just leave you with a bunch of useless ETH1 tokens? Personally I do not trust that the yieldfarms i am participating in will give me ETH2 tokens after the merge so I traded the little I had for BTC instead.

If they keep a POW chain would the initial price be the same price as ETH‚Äôs price at the time of the merge?

The center of the board is  adorned with the Celsius logo and the slogan ""Do Good. Then do well"",  and there is a ""HODL  Mode activated"" square that might have been a lot funnier before the  company involuntarily activated ""HODL mode"" for all its users.

We're all excited about MOON listings. MEXC then [Gate](https://Gate.io)... I assume a ton of other CEXes will follow.  But there's something regarding the Gate listing you MUST be aware of:

https://preview.redd.it/3uc2hiva70n91.png?width=2350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85ef28d994086224ff73de11debaa88e76579a86

# Gate takes MOON deposits only on Arbitrum, while the new MOONs are on Arbitrum Nova!

They won't deposit!

If you send MOONs to your Gate deposit address for MOONs, Gate will receive your good moons (on Abritrum Nova) since they control that ETH address, but they won't be credited into your account!

Exchanges never give you back crypto deposited into the wrong network, even though  they do control the key from those addresses. It's like depositing Binance-wrapped ETH into an ETH deposit address on the CEX! You will lose your money!

Second-tier exchanges often use wrong names of the blockchains (like Binance instead of BSC) but mostly it doesn't cause any trouble, because there's usually only one mainnet and it's self-explanatory. But in this case, when there's ~~Arbitrum,~~ Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova ‚Äì all different chains, it's pretty confusing. (fixed. Arbitrum and Arbitrum One is the same thing, thanks r/[**ismirschlecht**](https://www.reddit.com/user/ismirschlecht/) for pointing it out).

**Why not list MOONs on the actual blockchain they are currently on?? Like what is the reason??** It's like opening a BNB deposit but on the old ""Binance chain"", acutlaly receive lots of good BNB and keep it because it was indeed wrongly deposited. **This clever loophole will make Gate thousands of MOONs in wrong deposits.**

**Another reason to ALWAYS send a small test transaction first.**

PS: Full disclosure ‚Äì I did want to sell a portion of MOONs on the listing spike up to buy back a few hours later when the price would stabilze ‚Äì Gate's listing spikes are pretty sweet. But I only ended up losing 200 MOONs... Be careful out there!"|0.71|44|0|44

I was browsing the avatars and clicked on a $9.99 ""Knoo"" when it gave me a Google pay prompt to purchase. I really didn't want to spend any money on a non fungible- but when the Google pay prompt popped up I decided to go through all the cards I didn't recognize to see if maybe one of them had $10 on it that maybe I didn't know about.  

I try two or three cards that get rejected for insufficient funds when all of sudden one of the cards go through. I start investigating what card might have money on it and discover it's my coinbase card- which is odd because there are zero funds on the card, zero funds in the account, and the card is locked.  

I check my account to be sure I've got no money and that my card is still locked- and it is. Oddly enough, the transaction didn't display in the transaction history- which normally shows up immediately. So for testing purposes, I decided to see exactly what it might let me get away with... and what ensued was a 20 minute shopping spree that resulted in nearly 20 avatars being added to my vault.  

After awhile I click on one and the purchase finally gets denied. I get a text message saying a transaction was declined... this is what would normally have happened without sufficient funds. Out of curiosity I try a few more times and get a few more texts that it's been declined.  I log back on and my balance still shows zero and nothing is overdrawn. I go to my transaction history and only the last transaction declines are posted... none of the purchases.  

I go check my vault and they're there so I try and it lets me equip these ill-gotten characters. Only time will tell if coinbase is going to ask me to give them some money but I don't think they will have the nerve seeming how my card had no funds, and wasn't even unlocked for use. 

Now I'm trying to figure out how to peddle them on opensea.  I've got them in my metamask and got metamask hooked into opensea. I can see them but haven't figured out how to list them. Meanwhile I should have been asleep hours ago- but now got sucked into the world of reddit snoo's and knoo's.

Edit- there's a lot of ppl angry about this who think I'm interested in a few nft's who are missing the point. I'm not trying to defraud coinbase or i wouldn't be on a sub with 2 million ppl in it. I found a flaw and posted about it openly. My coinbase account remains open and they have my phone number. I might even send them an email requesting resolution and honestly don't expect them to hold me responsible. But if they did, big deal its a few bucks, not a few million. Pretty sure they got bigger problems than nft's from reddit

Edit 2- They busted me. My balance went negative and the charges now show up on my account. Sent some eth to my coinbase and brought the balance back into good standing. I'm still making a complaint since my card was locked but not pressed one way or the other. Easy come, easy go."|0.55|5|0|5

It seems like amateur hour over at the ETHPOW repo. Coinbase had to submit a PR to ask for clarification because the issue tracker was disabled for some reason. 

There's no clarity on when the chain will be available or when it will get activated. There's also a problem with the chain ID because they still haven't changed it to differentiate it from ETHPOS's ID so there's a risk of replay attacks.

The comments are savage af:

&gt; I think ETHPOW core lost access to this repo, they don't see to answer any pull request or do any commit in the last 14 days, so isn't probablly a good way of communications

And this one:

&gt;&gt; Is there any reason you can't add a function to switch chainID once TTD is hit, so that you can actually release a client that functions through the merge and can be released earlier

&gt; That requires a developer intern with a high school understanding of if conditionals. Probably can't find one.

And now it's completely the opposite.


Other than check this sub once in a while, I've created a ""mental safety barrier"" in order to not overthink about my investments. And I wish I'd done this sooner. I wish that from the start, I'd bought some cryptocurrencies and then forgot about them like I do now, it would have saved me so much stress and time. Checking the charts constantly is useless if you plan on holding for a long period of time. I wish I'd learn this sooner.


I wish that I learned sooner that if 99% of people want something to happen, for example X coin reach $100k by the EOY (like BTC) or $1 by the SNL show (like the whole Elon Musk and DogeCoin thing) then that won't happen, people will simply want to sell and dump their investment before it crashes, and it ends up tanking the price of the coin BEFORE said date.

This is my perspective, so you may or may not agree with me. Share something that you wish you'd know sooner.

Ahead of 'The Merge' ETH derivative markets are implying bullish sentiment. The call/put ratio currently stands at 3.81.  
   
Meaning, there are more than 3 times the number of options to buy vs options to sell.  
   
The highest call option stands at a US$3,000 strike price.  
   
It‚Äôs NOT all bullish for 'The Merge'‚Ä¶  
   
Major ETH whales have moved 11% of their holdings from cold wallets onto centralized exchanges. Historically, this is a sign of a plan to sell.

t3_xaan3i|1662768326|CryptoCurrency|There is little upside investing shortly before the merge.|"I'm somewhat of a DCA hardcore; purchasing at set intervals however there are a few times for speculation and I think this is one of them. 

As we all know there is a saying buy the hype and sell the news. Similarly market often swings when there are surprises. 

Well think about it, Ethereum has been doing really well recently outpacing even bitcoin, however this is most likely due to the highly anticipated merge that is going to happen sometime next week around September 14-16, at that time the Ethereum blockchain will switch from POW to POS.  

**this is huge but NOT for the reasons we think** for example gas fees will stay the same; even transaction time will stay similar. 

so the best case scenario everything goes well and most people will not even notice anything other than flashy headlines, the market is not surprised and things stays neutral. 

BUT if something bad happens, for example, a code messes up or SEC decided it's time to move then the entire thing gets slammed. 

ask yourself this, what surprises are there going to be? any benefit from the merge has already been studied and priced in. 

TLDR: I see very little in upside here; if things go well everyone is happy and the price could stay the same or lowers a bit but in the unlikely even that there is bad code somewhere the entire thing and may be the market is going to get slam for few days. 

My opinion; for sure not financial advice."|0.61|7|0|7

t3_xa8umt|1662763442|CryptoCurrency|Summary of Ethereum's new consensus protocol: Gasper|"This whole post is the summary/TL;DR of Ethereum's new consensus mechanism, **Gasper**. If you're not ""innit for the tech"", the **Intro** section provides an even shorter summary.

I originally posted this a week ago on the CryptoCurrency\_Tech sub, but I figure there might be 1-2 of you here who would be interested in this.

## Intro - A TL;DR of the TL;DR

[**Gasper**](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/Gasper/) is the hybrid consensus protocol that's used by post-merge Ethereum and the Ethereum Beacon chain. It's a combination of the **LMD-GHOST** and **Casper FFG** protocols.

* **GHOST**, originally used by pre-merge Ethereum, is a variation of Bitcoin's Nakamoto Consensus algorithm that allows for better fork-determination and faster block times. It uses heaviest weight instead longest chain to determine the canonical chain.
* **Casper** then provides an additional deterministic-finality layer on top of GHOST. This allows the Ethereum blockchain to have additional security using permanent checkpoints every epoch.

If you have 13 minutes of time, I highly recommend that you check out Alt Explainer's [Gasper video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gfNUVmX3Es). Consensus protocols are pretty complicated to explain without animation, and Alt Explainer does an excellent job of explaining it at an ELI-15 level.

## Bitcoin's Consensus Protocols

Before we begin, let's go over some simpler protocols. Most of you are familiar with **Bitcoin's consensus protocol**, which is a combination of Nakamoto Consensus and Proof of Work.

* **Nakamoto Consensus**, used for validation and fork-determination, states that in the case of forks, the **longest chain** (technically, it's the highest-difficulty chain) is the canonical chain. It provides probabilistic finality. There is always the possibility that transactions will be rewritten in the future by reorganizations (reorgs), but the more blocks have been written, the higher the probability that the transaction is probabilistically  final. For Bitcoin, this is generally considered by most exchange nodes to be 3-6 blocks. At \~10-minutes per block, that's a total 30-60 minutes for Bitcoin's probabilistic finality.
* **Proof of Work** (PoW) is used to provide Sybil Resistance, which prevents attackers from gaining more influence on consensus by creating multiple identities. Instead influence is determined by the total hash power of the entity's miners, which can't be faked by splitting into multiple identities.
* **Byzantine Fault Tolerance** (BFT) protocols are a family of extremely-fast consensus protocols used in distributed databases since the 1980s. Efficient BFT protocols are only 3-5% slower than their centralized versions when there is no network latency. They can handle faults of (n) bad nodes as long as there are (3n + 1) honest, working nodes. In other words, at least 2/3 of nodes need to be honest and working to maintain [liveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liveness), and at least 1/3 honest nodes to maintain safety/fault tolerance. Most large global tech companies use some form of BFT-Paxos/Raft or Practical BFT (pBFT) in their infrastructure. Most newer PoS blockchains use a variation of BFT for consensus, though there are some exceptions like Cardano's current version of Ouroboros.

**Pre-merge Ethereum** also uses PoW for Sybil Resistance. Later on, this switches to PoS, where influence is determined by the entity's total staking value instead of its total hash power. But for Consensus validation, Ethereum uses GHOST (Greedy Heaviest-Observed Sub-Tree), which is a variation of Nakamoto Consensus that provides a few optimizations.

## GHOST - Ethereum's main consensus protocol

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/loqdhk8bvwm91.png?width=660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e97216803ef8cc47bed9668980a6999a8c2a603

* PoW Ethereum has 13s blocks. Because its block times are much faster, it has a much higher chance of encountering forks due to network latency.
* **To counteract the forks**, it uses GHOST, which is a variation of Nakamoto Consensus that is more efficient for determining fork path. Nakamoto's longest chain rule only cares about length. (Technically, it checks the highest-difficulty chain, which for all practical purposes nowadays, is the longest chain.) Any blocks outside of the longest chain, called orphan or uncle blocks, are ignored and wasted. In the above image, Chains 1 and 3 are longer than Chain 2 even though Chain 2 has the most miners (weight) behind it. Under Bitcoin's Nakamoto consensus, this would lead to wasted mining power/influence.
* **Weight vs Length**: Unlike Bitcoin's Nakamoto Consensus, GHOST uses the concept of chain ""weight"" instead of ""length"". It will add the weight of orphaned and uncle blocks to each chain during fork determination instead of wasting them. Thus in the example, Chain 2 will win under the GHOST protocol.
* **PoS version of GHOST**: After transitioning from PoW and PoS, LMD-GHOST now measures weight by using the combined staking power attesting to blocks. A randomized [committee of 128 validators](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#configuration) are chosen using the RANDAO protocol at each epoch to attest to each block proposal. The chain that has the blocks with the most combined staking power behind them becomes the canonical chain. Attesting validators will also receive rewards along with the block proposer, who gets the most rewards. In addition, validators are slashed if they attempt to propose multiple blocks or double-vote on multiple chains. Slashing prevents validators from gaming the rewards system by voting on every chain for more attestation rewards.
* The **LMD** part of LMD-GHOST stands for ""Latest Message Driven"", which just means that if multiple messages are received by a validator, only the latest one is considered.
* Block times also reduce from 13s to 12s post-merge due to no longer having to wait 1s for mining during block proposals. Ethereum is typically considered probabilistically final in about 25 blocks (\~5 minutes). That makes PoW Ethereum's probabilistic finality \~12x times faster than Bitcoin's.

## Casper FFG - Ethereum's finality protocol

* Casper FFG is a BFT-based protocol that adds deterministic finality to the block chain. It requires at least 2/3 of validators to be honest and active. Ethereum blocks are divided into epochs every 32 blocks, or 6.4 minutes. If validators agree on [2 epochs in a row](https://kb.beaconcha.in/glossary#finalization), all previous epochs will considered deterministically final. Thus, it takes \~19 minutes for deterministic finality in most cases.
* Note that unlike many other fast-finality PoS consensus protocols, Ethereum actually gathers signatures from ALL validators instead of just from a subset of them. It does this through [BLS signature aggregation](https://ethresear.ch/t/pragmatic-signature-aggregation-with-bls/2105). Without signature aggregation, it would take 1 day to gather all the signatures.
* Because block production is computationally-trivial in Proof of Stake (since it doesn't take much energy), there theoretically exists [long-range attacks](https://dlt-repo.net/long-range-attack-in-proof-of-stake-pos-blockchains/). In a long-range attack, a malicious validator could build a longer forked chain and beat out the length of the canonical chain.
* Casper FFG provides checkpoints against long-range attacks. Blocks that reach deterministic finality are immutable, and active validators will not fall for the attack.
* One of the minor weaknesses of Ethereum is that it has Weak Subjectivity. What this means is that new nodes joining the network and nodes that have been offline for a long time cannot objectively tell which is the canonical chain. They have to ask existing nodes and pick the one they think is correct, hence adding subjectivity.

## Gasper - GHOST and Casper combined

* [**Gasper**](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/gasper/) **is the union of GHOST and Casper. It uses GHOST as the main consensus protocol with 5-min probabilistic finality, and adds a layer of \~20-min deterministic finality with Casper for checkpoints.** This is somewhat similar to Solana and Cardano in that they also have probabilistic finality with periodic checkpoints (deterministic in 80s and 5 days respectively).
* This is much slower finality than many newer PoS blockchains like Algorand, Avalanche, Cosmos/Tendermint SDK chains, Fantom/Hedera, and Polkdaot Substrate SDK chains, and many more. But Ethereum is a multi-layer ecosystem where its Layer 2 solutions can provide fast finality. Considering that Layer 1 Ethereum is meant to be a settlement layer instead of a payment channel or Medium of Exchange, this is an acceptable balance.
* Gasper also has protection against liveness attacks and inactivity leaks where some validators are no longer participating. After 4 epochs of inactivity, validators that are not attesting will gradually get slashed until the honest and active validators reach a 2/3 supermajority again.

t3_xa7ky5|1662760172|CryptoCurrency|Your piece of the cake - It doesn't take much fiat money to own an above-average share of the total Bitcoin supply.|"Good News! It doesn't take much fiat money at the moment to own an above-average share of the total Bitcoin supply. So you can ensure with only a few Dollars that you won't be left empty-handed in the event of a ""hyperbitcoinization"". That should also be reason enough for the critics and doubters to hedge against this scenario.

**How much Bitcoin is there per person?**

Let's assume the total number of Bitcoin that has ever been movable and will ever be movable is just under 21,000,000 BTC. So we assume that all Bitcoins are ""mined"" and that no one has really lost access for their Bitcoin, but that the Bitcoin that have not been moved for years simply belong to steel ""hodlers"".

If we divide the entire Bitcoin supply evenly among the world's population (currently \~8 billion people), each person would have 0.002625 (currently \~$56) Bitcoin.

In order to belong to the club of the richest 1%, it would take 0.2625 Bitcoin (currently \~$5600). This would mathematically guarantee that no more than 1% of the world's population could have more Bitcoin than oneself. The scenario would be that all Bitcoin would be divided among 80 million people (\~1% of the current world population) and the rest would have nothing.

However, the assumptions made are highly unrealistic. After all, hopefully one day everyone will have Bitcoin and not just a small amount of people."|0.72|13|0|13

Here are a few ways you can add to your stack and accumulate without actually spending money.  I am not going to mention staking as that there are risks involved and I don't want to get into technical details.  I'm also not going to discuss moons, because as community points, that are not intended to be traded.  People who do sell their moons see a reduction in earned moons in future rounds.

 

* Browse the web with Brave - This is a must.  Brave is a browser run on Chromium that offers Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) for just browsing the web. It is one of the best browsers for security and preventing advertising tracking. You can also support creators through the platform with BAT.  I've been earning 4-10 BAT ($2-4 USD) / month using Brave.  You can link your browser wallet with Gemini and use Gemini's earn feature for more return.  This isn't a ton of money, but if you're in it for the long haul, $50/year for 2 years before the next halvening, then a 10X nets you $1,000 for living life as you normally would. 
* Learn and earn - Some websites offer free coins if you learn about a specific Crypto for watching a brief video and taking a short quiz.  Coinbase is probably the most famous for these.  Personally, I've earned \~50 over the last year with this feature.    
As a note, I recommend immediately converting these coins to your favorite projects as the value typically drops dramatically after the L&amp;E due to heavy sell pressure.  
CoinMarketCap also has a learn and earn feature, though it is more limited.  The offers are region based, so you may be unable to participate. Either way, it is extremely easy to do and earn a few $.
* Crypto credit/debit cards - These are essentially cash back cards but paid out in Crypto. They are also great if you don't want to use a traditional bank. Popular options include [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/), BlockFi, Gemini, and Coinbase.  Most cards offers anywhere from 2-4% back and some have extra rules about what does and does not qualify for rewards.  I like CB's debit card.  The rewards change monthly, but they typically have a 4% back offer.  Even at 2% back, it beats a traditional credit card most of the time.
* Airdrops- First, be careful with these. There are a lot of scams, so make sure you DYOR before jumping in. However, many chains and projects offer airdrops of coins or NFTs.  [https://airdrops.io/](https://airdrops.io/) is a good place to start to see if you'd qualify for airdrops with any of the projects you hold.  
* Shopping rewards- This is different than using a credit/debit card (and often times these rewards stack).  There are some sites out there that give a crypto rebate.  Lolli and SocialGood are two that I've tried personally.  They have a few problems like a long delay for the payout (90 days in both cases), but if I were going to buy the product anyways, it's a nice bonus.
* Play To Earn Games- Play games that reward you with crypto. Gala Games is a popular platform. Gods Unchained, Crypto Royale, Axie Infinity, etc all follow the routine.  They games aren't great currently and require a lot of grinding to make any real money, but you might find a game you like.  
* Publisher0X- This is a blog that you can tip for free between 20-80 % to you and to the writer. This is a really great site that has a lot of good knowledge (as well as some terrible blogs) but the tip incentive is great.  Read and learn about crypto, and make a little bit every day.

I'd love to hear some other ways to earn free crypto."|0.72|41|0|41
t3_xa6spf|1662758155|CryptoCurrency|Greatest risk of Ethereum Merge that is generally overlooked|"During the Ripple hearings, the SEC's stance on other cryptocurrencies has been made clear repeatedly: SEC chairman Gary Gensler said Bitcoin is a commodity and not a security because 1) its core properties cannot be changed 2) there is no single entity that controls the asset so that its value is not representative of the performance of this entity.

Mr. Gensler also repeatedly stated, on the record, that the SEC does not consider ETH a security. That is, ETH *at present* is not under the suspicion of being a security. 

Will that change after ETH completely transforms (changes it's core property)? Well, it's anyone's guess, but the fact is **the Merge will allow the SEC to disregard it's previous opinion about Ethereum due to the drastic change in the fundamental design**

Ok, hypothetically, the SEC files a lawsuit against the Ethereum foundation accusing them of issuing and trading unregistered securities. So what?

Ethereum continues to operate just as it has. The developers remain undeterred, ecosystem unchanged. Maybe a few delistings by some overly compliant CEXes happen. The only aftermath (since the crypto market is so easily spooked) ‚Äî ETH price drops hard, like really hard, and drags the whole market along down for us to buy in.

For reference, look at the time when SEC VS Ripple was announced.

However, a potential SEC lawsuit against ETH will only take a toll on the price, not the tech, in which case ETH and other cryptocurrencies become (and this is the only context the use of the following phrase should be legally allowed) *undervalued*. 

So I'm actually looking forward to it. We'll all be in for a jackpot if it happens. If it doesn't happen, ETH is a beast that will make us pretty happy in the long run anyway."|0.54|3|0|3

t3_xa5gnv|1662754834|CryptoCurrency|Value Investing as a Crypto Investor: Do what Buffett did then, not what he does now|"**TLDR;** Value investing involves buying wonderful companies at fair, or below fair, value prices for mid to long term positions. By buying wonderful cryptos over the long term, you can attempt to build a portfolio much larger than you would've imagined. The hard part is understanding how to valuate a crypto as wonderful or not. If you can valuate whether a crypto is wonderful, and you can valuate a future price for said crypto, you can attempt to do what Buffett did in stocks, but today in crypto.

\*\*Not financial advise\*\*

Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffet, and Charlie Munger are some of the most famous value investors. They have pioneered an investment strategy where they only buy ""wonderful"" companies at fair, or below fair, prices. This method is commonly used in mid to long term stock purchases, but I am going to attempt to parallel it to mid to long term crypto investment.

**Why do I think value investing can be applied to crypto?**

When Warren Buffet started investing, investing was a lot harder. It was harder to obtain information, it was harder to sift through all of the information, and there was not a mass form of communication to provide instructional content for aspiring investors. Due to the variability of factors, I think it is okay to generalize that it was harder to invest in the 60's, 70's, and 80's compared to today. If you were to take a traditional approach to value investing today as Buffet did in his early career, you would look to individual stocks (companies) that are priced fairly, or discounted, from what you value their company over the mid to long term future. This is a fantastic model for success, but the competition for these trades are becoming much harder due to the availability of information, the internet and programs, and increased ability for traders to learn faster.

The area of opportunity is when you take historically accurate strategies, such as value investing, and apply them to new sectors that are harder for investors to learn. Crypto is just that. We are not super early, but still early in the space, and not a lot of people are as familiar with the concepts of running a BTC node, using an L2, the importance of owning your crypto, etc. The following metaphor is a little wrong, but think of Coca Cola when Buffet was buying in. It was a much smaller company than it is today, and was less guaranteed success, which makes it riskier then than it is today. Some people will say that Coke had been around for a long time before Buffett bought in, which is true, but it was still riskier then than it is now. This is how I attempt to parallel stocks to crypto. Stocks were newer when Buffet was investing than they are now. If you want to see the returns Buffett did, you would be better off finding a few wonderful emerging pieces of technology that are riskier than stocks. This is crypto. I understand that the metaphor barely hangs on, but it makes some sense. Warren was value investing into riskier assets then than he tells you to do today. If you listen to him today you can still make incredible money over your lifetime, but if you want to be as financially successful as him parallel to your current age, you will have to take riskier investments that parallel the risk he had back then. Look to what Warren did then to build wealth, not what he does now with his wealth.

**Is your crypto wonderful?**

So where do you start. In order to be a true value investor, you need to find wonderful companies (cryptos) that you believe are currently priced fairly or below fair value. For instance, most people would care to believe that BTC and ETH are the best value based plays because they have survived multiple bear markets, are the first movers of their respected fields, and have the the most dominant market shares within crypto. You could argue that BTC is old tech, ETH is expensive, etc., but it is up to you to develop metrics that you think classify a crypto valuable. Some metrics could be total market cap, TPS, TVL, perceived value based on stock company equivalent, or perceived value based on crypto equivalents.

Some of my personal checks that help me decide if something seems wonderful are the team, the communication, the niche solution that this project aims to solve, the ability for that problem to have a use case in the upcoming bull market, the ability for this project to be adopted, and the usability of the asset. For instance, I do think that BTC could be held by sovereign funds, large hedge funds, and very wealthy people for diversification. This could easily increase BTC's price. BTC is also wonderful because it was the first mover, it has not failed, it works for what it is supposed to do, and BTC is not trying to solve everything. I think ETH is wonderful because it was the first smart contract platform, it hosts a ton of defi, I think it has a lot of room to grow over the next 3-5 years, and I think the tech is current and works for now. There can be arguments as to why these two cryptos are not wonderful as well, but that is for you to decide on your thesis development.

**Is it at a fair, or discounted, price?**

If understanding if your crypto is wonderful is the most important thing, then understanding if its price is worth buying into is the second most important thing. There are many methods that you could deploy to understand the inherent value of a crypto company, but these change depending on the crypto you choose. BTC, and POW chains, can inherently be valued at the cost to mine said crypto. If you wanted to find out the minimum value for 1 BTC for you, you can just look up the cost to mine 1 BTC where you live. For me, it would be somewhere around $20,000. You could then take this one step further and see where the majority of BTC is mined, calculate the cost to mine based on the ratio of where BTC was mined, and find the AVG mining cost of 1 BTC worldwide. This would be an AVG minimum that BTC would have to be at fair value based on miner liquidity. It is hard for the BTC price to stay below this threshold for extended periods of time because miners will be losing money.

POS/smart contract cryptos need to be evaluated a bit differently. A lot of these cryptos can be compared to startup stock companies raising funding, or growth companies in their early stages post ICO. The one issue with cryptos is that there is no inherent financial reporting for users to help make valuations on. This is good and bad. Good because it makes the playing field harder for investors, and bad because valuations rely more on speculation. Let's speculate a bit though. I am sure most people would think that ETH has the potential to meet BTC's market cap based on the idea that it provides more technological capabilities, is more adaptable to changing technological needs, and has applications on it that can further drive price. Based on this, you could speculate that a fair ETH market cap could be equivalent to BTC in a bear market (and we already saw this last cycle when bull market ETH is equal in market cap to bear market BTC). Currently ETH would be worth $4,000 if it had BTC's bear market, market cap. One could impose that in a bull run, ETH is worth $4,000 (minimum) based on this logic. Anything below $4,000 would be a fair buy. You could also impose that BTC's base value will increase as mining rewards are halved in 2024. As rewards are slashed 50%, we can theorize that the minimum base value of 1 BTC can double from $20,000 to $40,000. Keeping all proportions the same between each crypto as they currently are, this would provide you with an $8,000 ETH next bull run as we expect crypto to continue to grow as an asset class.

Another example of this could be Cardano. Let's say that you decide that Cardano is a wonderful blockchain protocol. The next thing you would want to do is try to evaluate what you think its price could be in the next bull run in order to make an investment that grows money within the bear market. Some things that you could do is look at previous bear and bull markets to evaluate ADA's performance. We know that last bull run, ADA made it to the top 3 spot for crypto market caps. Based on your experience with ADA, its niche uses, etc., let's say that you think ADA will maintain its position in the top 10. If BTC is now worth $40,000 of mining costs in 2024, and ETH has proportionally increased, we can argue that ADA would proportionally increase as well from its current position. BTC's market cap is about 400 billion. ETH's market cap is currently around 200 billion. ADA's is about 20 billion (I made the numbers easier for easy math). Based on our 2024 halving expectation, BTC's market cap would jump to 800 billion, which would then drive ETH's market cap to 400 billion, and ADA's market cap to 40 billion.

**The challenges with value investing in crypto**

By now you're probably thinking, ""Wow this speculation is not for me! Basically you're saying that anything can happen at anytime."" You're right! This is a fair bit of speculation, but in a market where we literally do not know the next thing that is going to happen, and in a market where we get to be seed investors into startup companies, we have to expect the guarantees that seed funding managers get (basically nothing). We have to try our best with what we have. You as a personal portfolio manager have to be unbiased in your evaluation of how wonderful a company is and then take responsibility for the positions that you buy into. I take full responsibility for my Ardana investment, and I love it (everyone reading this is thinking, ""what's Ardana""). That investment can go to 0 and I will be okay because I believe in the project and will not miss out just in case it works as I think it will. This is how seed funding rounds work. Hedge funds believe in the people/projects/innovation that is shown to them in their board rooms, and they will invest into barebones projects because they only have to get 1 right a year to beat the market.

Crypto has a lot of things that can go wrong, but also a lot of things that can go right. I see people using ETH. I see people using ADA. I see thriving communities within a subculture of crypto lovers. I see mass adoption coming to life before us. The Merge is on news headlines, and crypto is more out there than ever before. There is regulation, there are scams, there are projects that will give up and others that will just not be applicable in today's time, but if you understand all of these factors, you could make some seriously good bets. Your project might have everything going for it, but something just does not work. You might get one absolutely right. This is as far as I can take you on this topic, but if you find a system that works for you, you can attempt to find valuable cryptos at discounted prices. Below is my system.

**My System:**

1. Pick an L1, L2, or sector of crypto (think gaming, NFT's, defi) and go all in on it. Learn everything. Mine is Cardano. I know everything about Cardano and Cardano native projects.
2. Read about your chosen path in step 1 for 3-6 months minimum. Just keep some notifications on, read for like an hour a day, watch the projects, and assess if this is still the right place for you to be. You might need to switch and restart at step 1. I have notifications on my favorite Cardano projects, I monitor all crypto general news, economy general news, and other favorite areas like ETH. It's easy for me because I genuinely love it.
3. Build a list of factors that you think make a project like BTC or ETH wonderful and apply it to your choice in step 1. I think ADA is wonderful because of its security, its usability, I have a lot of fun with it, all members of the ADA team are communicative if you look hard enough, the project is a solid contender among cryptos. To me, ADA is wonderful just as ETH is wonderful.
4. Besides just your main pick from step 1, are there any other native assets within your step 1 pick that can also be wonderful? Since you're an expert in this one section of the crypto world, you might have merit to decide other wonderful smaller caps based on your expertise in a sector. I think Ardana and Orbis are wonderful based on their unique propositions for the current needs of Cardano. I also think Minswap is wonderful as I use them for their deep liquidity, but I do not hold and of their token.
5. Wait and see if you were right.

I‚Äôve found myself improving my life as a by product of crypto.

That extra $210 a month went into crypto.
Since then I‚Äôve gone from having a gym membership to continuing to workout at home, which saves an additional $60 a month which goes to crypto.

In addition to that, I‚Äôve gone from over a 30 rack of beer twice a week, to a six pack on the weekends. Where now I drink way higher quality beers in less frequent periods, so that‚Äôs $10-15 instead of $45 a week, netting me an additional 30$ a week in sats.

The idea is to use the upvote system to pit narratives against one another.

We know a lot of narratives go around in this space and it is sometimes hard to piece together what is truly the sentiment at any given time.  So I was thinking about a way to have the community express what are their thoughts about different projects in a way that is easy to access and better organized.

&amp;#x200B;

So the basic idea is:

* **Someone opens a thread with the name of a project and list in a few sentences what they think is/are its strongest point(s).**
* **Other redditors answer, also in a few sentences, with what they think are the most important downsides of the project.**

The idea is not to post a wall of text arguing for a particular position or another, but just listing the main points going around about each project. Then, it will be a matter of people upvoting what argument they find more convincing and see which one wins out. I'll try to show an example.

OP:

&gt;**ETHEREUM (ETH)**  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The most successful smart contracts network currently, already securing billions of dollars in transactions in a decentralized manner, offering too many nodes to present a likely possibility of failure.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The POS mechanism is bound to suffer less scrutiny by regulators in the long run as it is less energy intensive.

Then someone could reply:

&gt;\- The POS mechanism is not yet tried and tested and hasn't even happened yet.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Other networks that support smart contracts provide cheaper and faster transactions and will become more attractive as more businesses join it.

Then, it is a matter of upvoting whatever the community deems a more convincing argument.

I do understand we will see a good degree of tribalism going on with the arguments and upvotes. But I also think that it is a way to provide us with a snapshot of sentiment in this sub and aggregate the common narratives going around at the moment. I'll repost my Ethereum example so it can provide a template for other users and keep a somewhat standardized format for ease of use, but it should not be limited to Eth or bitcoin. Any project is valid, no matter how niche or if a memecoin.

Hopefully this will be an informative experiment, giving us a somewhat accurate of why this sub feels a particular way about different projects."|0.56|1|0|1

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 Ethereum is expected to undergo an upgrade (known as ‚ÄúThe Merge‚Äù) and transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake between September 10-20, 2022.  


The Merge is a major milestone for the Ethereum community and Kraken will support this event in ways that help our clients and further Kraken's mission.  


What should I expect from the Merge?

## Funding, Trading

Your assets will remain safe, as always, and no action is required on your part. There will be no need to convert your existing ETH into anything else before, during or after The Merge. Your current ETH balance will continue to be visible as ETH.¬†  


In order to ensure a smooth transition, deposits and withdrawals for ETH and all Ethereum-based (ERC20) tokens will be temporarily suspended during the Merge but ETH trading markets will remain active and available just as they have prior to the network update.

## Forked tokens

During this transition, new forked tokens may be created. Kraken will subject any newly forked token(s) to the same strict review process that we follow before making any token available for trading. It is not guaranteed that any such tokens will be made available for trading, as per our policy.¬†Even if Kraken does not decide to support trading of ETH PoW (or other forked tokens), **Kraken may still decide to support custody of ETH PoW (or other forked tokens). In that case, if you hold ETH in your account, we would credit your account with a new ETHW (or other designated ticker) token.**  


Where can I learn more?  


Please refer to the link below for more information about the Merge:

As far as I can tell, Kraken is the only one that might give CEX users that maybe staked ETH or is holding ETH on their CEX the air dropped coins around this merger.

While they aren't giving the exact tokens, it is SOMETHING.

&amp;#x200B;

Note Coinbase sent an email out I think yesterday. It basically said those who staked ETH won't be able to unstake until 2023 I think. But they will be giving us some other token so we can trade our locked tokens for other things. But I don't recall seeing anything about them giving us the forked tokens or anything around that.

IMO we need to push hard for it to be a standard practice for users on CEX to get the forked tokens and airdrops both inside this merger and outside. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Before anyone says some BS about not your keys not your crypto. 

Until recently you couldn't really stake ETH to support ETH 2. While with many CEX like Coinbase and Kraken you could. In the case with CEX, you were told ahead of time you were locking your tokens until ETH 2 came out (which is why I think Coinbase is doing what they are doing. Like for legal reasons.) 

And then this ignores how much of the world population doesn't have the understanding on how to hold their crypto on anything but a CEX.

And lastly, saying such things basically brushes away any bad behavior from the CEX. Like it switches the blame to the user, when this could easily be fixed with an industry wide standard. Like if Coinbase and some of the others stepped up and did this. It could become an expected standard."|0.65|10|0|10

For those of you who don‚Äôt know about MEXC, it‚Äôs an Asia  based CEX (China, I believe) that doesn‚Äôt require KYC. I‚Äôve used it serval times. Many of us here have also used it to buy ASA‚Äôs on the Algorand blockchain such as YLDY. 

All that is just to say that although it‚Äôs not the best exchange, it may come off as a little sketchy, it does work. It even has live customer service agents, but you can tell that English is not their native language.

This should make buying Moons a much much cheaper experience. Buying Eth, then transferring to Arbitrum has outrageous fees. I paid as much as 20% last week. Being able to just use USDT to buy and then send to wallet will cut down on fees dramatically.

One caveat though. In my experience, it takes an unusually long time to deposit. For example, I would send XML or Algo to my Mexc Wallet it it might take 2-3 hours to confirm sometimes. Other times 15-30mins, which is still a long wait for those coins. 

Setting up an account is pretty straightforward.

First thing you want to do is go to MEXC website and create your account, KYC is not required so email is really it.

Second thing you should do is set up your two factor authentication, MEXC requires you to use an email code they send you for every transaction and the code from your authenticator app. (google authenticator is one you can download)

 Make sure you double check everything as you do it especially the network and address, if you send to the correct address but wrong network your crypto will be lost. MEXC will highlight the important information in red for you so pay attention to that.

The first ever NFTs Rare Pepes were minted in Bitcoin block 428919 using the Counterparty protocol which was released in 2014 for creating and trading custom digital tokens on Bitcoin.

[Rare Pepe Directory](http://rarepepedirectory.com/)

Rare Pepes are NFTs avant la lettre. That is they predate the coining of the term non fungible token.

A total of 1774 Rare Pepe cards have been released across 36 series.

In October 2021, a Rare Pepe NFT called 'Pepenopoulous' which was created in 2016 was sold for a record [$3.6 million](https://twitter.com/SummerTimeFor3/status/1453004501150048257) at Sotheby's auction.

[Counterparty](https://counterparty.io/) was launched by anonymous developers through 'proof of burn' without premine or ICO to eliminate any source of unfairness in bootstrapping and make sure that initial distribution of funds was fair and decentralized.

XCP tokens were created by sending 2140 BTC to a provably unspendable Bitcoin address. None of the funds went to the creators. XCP is used to create and trade custom user assets, security tokens and participate in prediction markets. You can read all about it in the archived article below from 2014.

Anyone with suggestions on how he might be able to accomplish this? 

I'm not super familiar with his circumstances, so please let me know if there are any questions that you have for him and I will ask him to respond.

Trustable is a company building 3 products:

**For institutions:** 

- A global interbank FX network with 24/7 instant &amp; feeless settlement (using the Nano codebase)
- Commodities Exchange (commodities such as rice) with interoperability with the FX network. These would purely be fully backed assets and work for rice, gold, currencies, any type of asset.

**For retail:** 

- Commercial Nano wallet with 100+ fiat pairs to Nano (and possibly other crypto) with debit cards. For this part, watch from ~15:00 onwards in the video. It's basically an extremely easy way to on/offramp into Nano (and again, possibly other crypto), inside the wallet. The network for this is based on Nano and it sounds like it should make remittances a whole lot easier - sort of like what Ripple is trying to do in a way.

**The people behind the company:**

- Duncan MacInnes, Serial entrepreneur, active in FX &amp; treasury for over 17 yrs,  runs Xenfin Capital (trades $9bn of currencies on a daily basis with Tier 1 banking clients such as Deutsche Bank, HSBC and, J.P. Morgan). Founder &amp; Chairman of NEO (getneo.com), regulated challenger bank, along with 465 Group - a private equity group with a strong focus on tech having backed many household names like Facebook &amp; Revolut.
- Colin LeMahieu, Founder of nano and Co-Director of The Nano Foundation &amp; Appia. Executive &amp; highly experienced software engineer, previously at: Qualcomm, NI (National Instruments), AMD, Dell Technologies.
- George Coxon, Co-Director at Nano Foundation | Director of Appia | Advisor &amp; Lecturer at The Global Blockchain Initiative | Faculty member of the Zigurat Innovation &amp; Technology Business School Global Masters in Blockchain &amp; Industrial Fellow at the University of East London. Background in finance &amp; human behaviour studies.
- Benjamin Yablon, Experienced technology strategist focused on Web3, Blockchain, FinTech, Digital Identity and Artificial Intelligence. Founder, SALT Lending; Special Advisor OECD - OCDE. Early career spent as a practicing attorney focused on emerging technology platforms and global compliance.

I'm personally pretty excited about this because it means Nano's tech being implemented and introduced to many financial institutions, and because it should make remittances a whole lot cheaper and faster.

Would love to hear what people here think of it, I'm largely in the Nano bubble so I've no idea whether this company is even on the radar of the rest of the crypto world."|0.82|113|0|113
t3_x9ysd6|1662738162|CryptoCurrency|USD spending power up 14% year to date|"Since the beginning of the year the value of USD is up 14% compared to the global currency market. This accounts for inflation and exchange rate between currencies. 

We often think of crypto as allowing people in developing nations with high inflation to protect their money against inflation. Crypto provides an opportunity for everyone to store their money in a different currency. If you lived in the UK, Switzerland, or the Euro zone you would have more capital if you were storing money in USD stablecoins. 

Now, currency arbitrage has been around for a long time. Crypto makes it a lot lower fee and accessIble for the average person. 

The fact that the spending power of USD has gone up 14% is not necessarily a good thing. It has been spurred by the US raising interest rates which then has caused other countries to strengthen their currency by raising their interest rates. This can then have domino effects that can slow the world‚Äôs economy."|0.73|7|0|7

t3_x9ycx8|1662737116|CryptoCurrency|A beginners guide to the Algorand ecosystem. Algorand has seen a huge explosion of development over the last year. Here is an updated list of Wallets, Explorers, DeFi platforms, Gaming, and Music &amp; NFT market places to get you up to speed on the best dApps on Algorand.|"Algorand in the last year has seen a Cambrian explosion of development and partnerships. Looking back it's hard to believe we have come this far as it's easy to take it for granted. This time last year there was ONE DeFi application.

Since then we have seen huge partnerships and an ever expanding suite of amazing DApps. And yet, this is only the beginning. Algorand has only been on mainnet for 3 short years. It is still an infant!

Since being part of the Algorand community I've met some of the most intelligent, generous, kind, and inspiring people. I'm so excited to be a part of this experiment and journey to make the world a better and fairer place for all. This is the main reason I became so interested in blockchain, it has the potential to revolutionize the world and how we interact with government, institutions, and each other.

The Algorand mission is to facilitate global trust through decentralization, enable simple designs that drive adoption by billions, and produce elegant technology that eliminates barriers to prosperity for all. Anyone off of the street should have access to the same sophisticated financial tools that right now only the elites have. Algorand is making this a reality.

*Flex NBA* is the very first Battle Tile and Augmented Reality (AR) board game that fuses professional sports with the latest in augmented reality technology. Created in partnership with the NBA and NBPA, FLEX NBA lets fans play as their favorite NBA players, using their FLEX 'superpowers' to take down opponents!

The game comes with 10 NBA player tiles, from which each of the 2 players drafts a team of 5 tiles. Players also have the option to purchase expansion sets that include additional NBA player tiles so that they can build their collections. Players don't need to watch actual NBA games in order to play the game. The game mechanic itself is similar to many other TCG's out there (although because of our NBA license we can't call ourselves a TCG - hence why we refer to ourselves as a BTG - battle tile game).

Once players have assembled their lineups, they then take turns rolling the play action die and taking actions based upon the results of the roll. There are additional status FX tiles that enhance the player's move set and give them various competitive advantages. With many of the moves that a player makes (aka Flexes), they will whittle down the other player's confidence points (health) until the opponent's team is depleted of CP.

The mobile companion app integration serves 2 primary purposes - 1) it is necessary to view the player tiles' AR animations, and 2) it is necessary if players wish to register the unique bar codes on their player tiles to our database and thereby claim ownership (per our NBA license, we cannot use the words NFT or blockchain, but that's what it actually is).

It will likely be a race to dump POW eth as fast as possible to get USDC or regular ETH. People might offer to trade you POW ETH for $40 USDC or something. Free money right?

DO NOT DO THIS

As of right now, the clowns behind POW ETH can't even agree on a new chain ID. If POW ETH forks without a new chain ID this is bad. It means is that when you send a transaction on the POW chain it can be replayed on the POS chain, and vice versa.

So if you send someone POW ETH for $40, they will replay that transaction on mainnet and take your hard earned regular ETH for a fraction of what its worth.

If you really want to send POW Eth, here's how to do it safely:

1. Create two new wallets (B) and (C). Transfer all your assets from the main wallet (A) to wallet B just before the merge.
2. After the merge, you can transfer all assets from wallet ‚ÄúB‚Äù to the main wallet (A) for the PoS chain.
3. Then, transfer all PoW assets from wallet ‚ÄúB‚Äù to ‚ÄúC,‚Äù the latter becomes your primary wallet for trading on the PoW chain.¬†

Now when you send POW ETH from wallet C, it contains no regular ETH for attackers to replay the transaction with.

Stay safe out there

EDIT: This is only for people who want to try to interact with the POW ETH hard fork. This is a hard fork of ETH set up by miners so they have something to mine - it is NOT the merge. If you have no plans to interact with POW ETH this will not affect you, your ETH will make it through the merge without you doing anything"|0.84|203|0|203

Market seems to be optimistic about the merge for now. ETH prices right now is 1726$. A +6% change in the last 24h and projecting toward 2000$. 























I don't know how the merge will go. Some think it will be great, some think it is ought to be a disaster. But I know one thing. It will keep going up due to hype at least until the merge is complete. And not only ETH but BTC and most alts are went up in the last few days. If the trend continues like this I will not be surprised if ETH hits somewhere around 2000$ in few days.
























Now I don't know where it will stop. Or where the ceiling is (if such a thing is even possible). But I know for a fact that of you bought anything during the crash you have a chance to take a nice profit. 
And I do know that fundamentals are against the market so prices most likely will go down again.






















So I think if at any point you can take a nice profit it is logical to sell and wait for the market to dive again and then buy more at a lower price. Ofc it is only my opinion and I can be a totally wrong. EtH at least on paper can keep going up even after the merge. All I am saying is you can consider this as a nice opportunity to ride the wave.

This has never happened before.. but okay. I can understand. However, its been over 2 months now. I tried withdrawing again incase I was a dumb dumb who did not properly do it but no! I did withdraw! Thrice! and not one of them has been processed. I reached their twitter, only to be responded back with scammy accounts posing as them..

I did this based on BTC Dominance which almost hit a new all-time low in the past 1666 days.|"While I'm DCA into Bitcoin whenever I receive my paycheck (just like most of you did in this sub), **I am also trying to increase my Bitcoin amount.**

During the last couple of weeks, I have DCA my BTC into ETH for the Ethereum merge speculation. One week ago, I started DCA my ETH back to BTC. I did this based on BTC Dominance which almost hit a new all-time low in the past 1666 days.

\-

**What is BTC dominance (BTC.D)?**

In a simple formula, 

Bitcoin dominance = Bitcoin market cap / Total cryptocurrency market cap

[Top: BTC Price \/ Bottom: BTC.D](https://preview.redd.it/ro8s3i73ytm91.png?width=2676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e75411632d39013452ba3cc63341f820c0d639be)

It generally means there is some other hype in the space when BTC.D drops. During the bull market between 2017 and 2018, the BTC.D fall because of the ICO hype. We had many yield farming projects back in mid-2021, so the BTC.D dropped again.

**For all the cases above, it happened in a Bullish Market. This week, I found out that BTC.D almost hit a new all-time low, but we're in a bearish market now. What does it mean?** 

In the bearish market, we don't have other projects or new concepts pulling money out of Bitcoin. So we don't have that momentum to drive a lower BTC.D. While we're around the corner of the Ethereum merge, it's the most significant event that most speculators focus on and will end soon.

**Nothing else going to drive the BTC.D to a lower low, so it means it has a higher chance of recovering to a higher level.**

\-

According to my assumption, here are the 2 different scenarios:

1/ Bitcoin tank, and all the other coins tank harder, which drives BTC.D up.

2/ Bitcoin pump and all the other coins sideways or slightly drop, driving BTC.D up.

\-

So that's why I DCA my ETH (and some other crypto) back to BTC.

What's your thought on this Bitcoin dominance? Are any of you trying to increase your Bitcoin as well?"|0.59|8|0|8

When prices drop, not many new shorts are opened (people don't like to catch falling knifes, not only when buying Bitcoin), but pumping prices are really bad for people who bet on falling charts.

Thus the recent pump of Bitcoin price was accompanied by a huge drop in short positions. Be aware, the number on the bottom scale is not USD (as claimed), it's Bitcoin:

Having been around the markets in one form or another for more than a decade. I‚Äôve tested pretty much every free indicator under the sun.

The Supertrend is a superior indicator for one simple reason: it adjusts based on the volatility of the market.

In crypto, volatility is your friend. Having a trend-following strategy that improves returns based on volatility is what you are looking for.

What is the Supertrend?

It‚Äôs not much different from a moving average except it accounts for volatility using the ATR (average true range) of a given price candle.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4h0wm555wtm91.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a18c40e5eb5a9727d05ced6ffeb01b9d904df58

Here you can see the comparison over the same period, the supertrend adapts better to the dynamics of price action.

Why Use the Supertrend in Trading¬†Crypto

Even as it craters in value from 3 trillion to less than 1 trillion, crypto is still an asymmetrically risk-positive trending asset.

In other words, for every dollar you risk, a net gain can be assumed over a given period of time (2 years or less). If you had put in 1 dollar at a random point in 2022 you are definitely not in profit. But from its nascent days of 2009, if you performed the same mathematical trick, you would likely be up many multiples from your initial investment.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gr152r88wtm91.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02c563af88f1ea94a47e784afeb1d10526b397e0

**The supertrend helps you stay in these asymmetrical trends longer**¬†than other indicators. The RSI, Bollinger Bands and even Moving Averages tend to give premature exit signals whereas the Supertrend keeps you in profitable trends for longer than other indicators.

Limitations of the Supertrend

The supertrend settings are subjective and the results random. Depending on when you start your backtest, and when you end it, your profitability will vary widely. In addition, the curve fitting which can occur by trying to find the perfect settings will surely lead to underperformance in a forward test environment.¬†***The best settings are a mirage, once you get that into your mind, the indicator becomes far more useful.***

How to Profit from the Supertrend

Ok now that all the dirty boring stuff is out of the way.¬†*How can you make money trading with the supertrend?*

As with anything, it depends on how you execute, and unfortunately, there is no binary approach(always In the market) to trading with the supertrend which will allow you to profit each and every time. People have tried and failed, to program the supertrend as a stand-alone trend following system. It simply doesn‚Äôt work.

This is where¬†[**CoinRotator**](http://coinrotator.app/)¬†becomes incredibly useful. Identifying coins that are already trending against BTC, ETH and USDT.

The CoinRotator webapp will show you the freshness of the trend when searching for any altcoin in the top 1000+.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1hz3qqmbwtm91.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=965293c7115647a33a1b95ac5156e4b2fd6a8da6

5 days old signal, a good sign for a Buy. At this point, you can head to your charts with the supertrend and try to find an intraday opportunity to buy ADA.

If you want to know more about how CoinRotator works you can check out the explainer¬†[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcyZcip24pM&amp;t=9s&amp;ab_channel=CoinRotator)¬†made just a few days ago.

What I am looking for is a pullback on a smaller time frame chart. If you are short on time looking at anything below the 4hr timeframe is simply gambling.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/52vw7emdwtm91.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1926779b35016237bcfaca4c12066e3855a65fbe

&amp;#x200B;

1. Deep RSI Pullback
2. Price remains above daily supertrend
3. Price re-enters the bullish supertrend

The important takeaway here is that the higher time frame trend (in this case, the daily trend) remains intact. I want to see a healthy test lower and see price move back up.

If you‚Äôd like to get my template, feel free to drop by our discord. Nothing to pay or anything creepy like that, I just like to know who is using the setup and what they think of it.

**Where do you sell?**

My exit is kinda conservative but it works for me. It might require more patience than you are accustomed to. But I like to hold until there is a red close but in profit. What does this mean? Maybe a visual example will help.

**What does waning momentum look like?**

1)Rsi Divergence

2)No new highs after X amount of candle closes

3)Price closes below the supertrend

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h4hcna6gwtm91.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a830a8df1079b0f35d912112bbe7afcd892632fe

**Where to take losses?**

Since not every trade is a winner with this strategy it's important to know when the trade has broken down and when to exit with a loss. Again, this is not a perfect scenario and every trade is different.

1)Wait for the CoinRotator screener to issue a DownTrend.

2)Check the daily supertrend on the coin you are tracking

3)Use a fixed percentage stop (least recommended)

One thing that is often cited is also ""price manipulation"", most of the time by people complaining about their losses (ü§°)

But what is manipulation, more precisely? Or at least a pretty relevant for of manipulating prices

 Imagine placing big limit orders in the bid/ask (i.e. layering)

Algos will see such orders, interpret them as originated from someone with some kind of information advantage and set orders closer to the big order, thus moving the market
Imagine then to cancel the big order (i.e. spoofing)... who does this can artificially manipulate price

This is illegal in any traditional market (in forex central banks can do so in order to try to make price stabler), and also very Easy to be identified by authorities

It is legal in crypto

Now, add to this many cryptos are illiquid and many exchanges giving access to massive leverage... incredible rallies and crashes seem, to me, way more clear now

What would happen if governments would make this illegal also in crypto? (Yes, they can)

205 KCS token which are equal to about 2k usd. Yay.

Copied the contract address to bscscan and saw that there are like 10M kcs tokens total supply and 33000 holders. Most of them got the same 205 quantity. ALL OF THEM WERE DISTRIBUTED YESTERDAY.

The wallet is branded with  MEXC.COM 3 name. So I go the wallet and see that it leads to external site of mexc.com exchange site.

I dropped my inquiry about the wtf airdrop to support but they were like:
-must have been some promo.

I never even had an user on this site.

Wtf?

What could happen to my wallet if I go to pancakeswap, import the token and swap it to bnb? Could the contract creator somehow get access to my wallet and send all the funds to himself and leave my with zeroes? Please, explain someone."|0.61|8|0|8

Since they funded the lawsuit challenging Tornado sanctions, they took credit for that but one of their employees took the celebrations way too far. 

Coinbase' Head of Engineering Peter Kim posted a thread where he claimed Coinbase is the only exchange that ""does not trade against you, front-run you, and give you the short end of the stick""

[Hmmm...](https://preview.redd.it/2mv4pk6fftm91.jpg?width=1174&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97d97410ee39eda00e5499bcd12678d4e2402d33)

Thats pretty rich coming from an exchange that just last month had its employees arrested for insider trading...

The shit show doesn't stop here. Someone of course pointed out the insider trading claims to this fella, to which he said ""never generalize based on the actions of a few bad apples"" and then questioned who paid Cobie to expose the insider trading.

Now some background: FTX sponsors one of Cobie's popular podcasts. Around March, Cobie noticed a wallet buying a bunch of coins that Coinbase was about to add. At that time, Coinbase promised to investigate the incident. It ended with DOJ busting couple of Coinbase employees for insider trading, who have since been fired from Coinbase. 

In response to the Coinbase employee above, Cobie shared a screenshot where he was in a call with the CEO of Coinbase, right around the time these insider trading activities were reported by Cobie. 

[Evidently, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong spoke with Cobie to discuss the serious insider trading charges.](https://preview.redd.it/3m7unbsmgtm91.jpg?width=708&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac0374dbb12c4cd8dbcc7c8588cfe3147cc9a133)

This Coinbase employee's behaviour has drawn stern rebuttals, including from Ari Paul. Cobie later said Coinbase even offered Cobie a job to expose insider trading and other such issues, to which Cobie said he would report them for free."|0.93|556|0|556

&amp;#x200B;

Time to recap: I went through the data provided by the links in this sub to give you some plots and numbers to discuss with your friends, loved ones and enemies.

&amp;#x200B;

# Karma to moons ratio

But how much moons will you get for your hard earned karma? This is determined by the karma to moons ratio and the plot you searched so long for shows how this ratio changed over time:

&amp;#x200B;

[Round 1 to 30: karma to moons ratio](https://preview.redd.it/mjw1cyohysm91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11f9e209b529e97c3ca7f019a1015123068aa971)

Lucky you if you were a contributor in the early days!

&amp;#x200B;

# Karma cap

Unlimited karma - unlimited moons, right? Wrong! There is a karma cap and every karma above it will not reward you with precious moons. Here is the plot how the karma cap changed over time:

&amp;#x200B;

[Round 1 to 30: karma cap \(or at least the maximum karma present in the data\)](https://preview.redd.it/tjuzcvk7zsm91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8205bd3761809c1505cc90584b4be0f852390753)

&amp;#x200B;

# Contributors

But how many contributors are out there looking for moons? Here is the plot you are looking for:

&amp;#x200B;

[Round 1 to 30: contributors](https://preview.redd.it/55sjp26rysm91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d27dc031f35a0d99588a104ced32d8fce2ac07f5)

I'm not saying this looks like the BTC price curve, but...

&amp;#x200B;

# Moons Top 10%

Everybody is happy with their moons - right? But what if you put even more effort in posting and commenting? How much moons do you need to be in the top 10%? Here is the plot that gives you the answer:

&amp;#x200B;

[Round 1 to 30: moons needed to be in top 10&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/6glxy3cpzsm91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3a5fdf0ef8739183e944f41c5337f9d1d7dd3b4)

Yes, the early days karma to moons ration shot rewarded moons to the moon (badumm tss) and thats why you needed a lot of moons during this period to be top of the hill.

&amp;#x200B;

# Round 30 moons distribution

What does the actual moons distribution looks like? How many contributors got how much moons? Here is the distribution for round 30 (and because the majority only gets a few moons this plot is followed by a log-scale plot to better see the actual distribution):

&amp;#x200B;

If the price action would be similar to last bear market, the price would be bottoming around $250 judging by the relative prices. I myself have a more bullish sentiment and think we might have hit the bottom but comparing the cycles does look a bit bearish in my opinion.

When calculating your average buy price, It would seem intuitive to simply divide the buy prices by the number of buys and get and simple average.

Lets use this screenshot for example:

https://imgur.com/LVEeIOm

This would calculate to 
(1646+1948+1543+1891)/4=1757


Now if we want an average that accounts for the different quantity we got at each price, we want to do whats called a weighted average where we multiply each buy in price by the amount of money that bought it and we divide by the total money invested. 

((1646*635)+(1948*563)+(1543*985)+(1891*853))/((635+563+985+853))=1737.42160738

Too great, I thought, so I looked into it more on here and some other sites and they explained that you actually lose a % because they aren't 1:1. I thought how can that be? If I sell eth for ALGO they aren't 1:1 but without fees you end up with roughly the same fiat value. 

So I converted ¬£100 just to test them. On the preview screen of the trade it even says you are wrapping ¬£100 of eth 2 and right under that it says fee:0 total ¬£100 cbeth. Then you hit ""accept and wrap now"". And all of a sudden you have about ¬£92 of cbeth.

I disagree that the price of crypto is driven by the cost of mining hardware.

Think about it like this. These students will soon become the working class responsible for running our society and taking all the major decisions.

If these students have been already predisposed to blockchain and Web3 technology then the chances of them integrating crypto and Web3 as a whole into the society will dramatically increase.

After BitDAO‚Äôs announcement yesterday regarding the launch of EduDAO, I really started thinking about this. It‚Äôs really not that far fetched of an idea to see students integrating Web3 into the real world half a decade from now especially that a lot of high tech universities will be working with EduDAO.

- Blockchain at Berkeley
- Harvard Blockchain
- Blockchain at Michigan
- MIT Sloan Blockchain
- Berkley RDI
- Oxford Blockchain Society

These are all classes and initiatives that EduDAO will be working with to help students learn professionally about blockchain and eventually become professional Web3 builders.

What‚Äôs important is that we start seeing more mainstream and affordable universities following suit which honestly I don‚Äôt see as something far from happening.

What EduDAO will be doing soon is a kickstart to a domino effect that might trickle blockchain into our everyday lives a decade or less from now.

There are plenty of things that will definitely help with boosting adoption, but my personal opinion is that nothing will be as significant as this."|0.85|185|0|185

# At first we got gluttony.

""Don't lay all your eggs in the same basket"", only because one project gave you great results, you shouldnt invest 100% of your portfolio into it, trust your other investments and diversify your portfolio.

&amp;#x200B;

# Lust

Don't try to chase big wins with leverage trading, it might be a nice ""high"" to get such huge wins, but you are going to regret it as soon as you get liquidated.

&amp;#x200B;

# Anger

Don't ever lose your mental or physical health for a loss. Its only a real loss if you sell, and even then you have learned something important.

&amp;#x200B;

# Sloth

A 5 minute youtube video or newsletter by an influencer isnt enough information, and most of the time they aren't trustworthy. Always do your own research.

&amp;#x200B;

# Greed

Ah good old greed, our worst enemy. Don't FOMO because market turned green, just stick to your investment plan and you are good to go.

&amp;#x200B;

# Pride

Don't share your investments with your close ones and always stay humble, especially in this volatile market you can get fucked quick.

&amp;#x200B;

# Envy

Don't envy others if they are able to afford more crypto, had a better entry price, or had 1-2 lucky moonshots. Be happy for each other and remember, we are all in this together."|0.68|14|0|14
t3_x9csop|1662673588|CryptoCurrency|"I'm tired of asking ""how"", we should be asking ""why"". Vitalik said it best."|"Many of you have read the [TIME interview with Vitalik](https://time.com/6158182/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-profile/) (creator of Ethereum), speaking eloquently about an identity crisis in crypto that has grown over the past few few yearss. What is crypto even about any more? A lot of very talented developers are asking ""how"" questions. Like ""how can we solve the trilemma?"" or ""how can we get more transactions per second?"" pr ""how can we make the best L2?"". Those are all important questions. But Vitalik is one of the few visionaries who asks ""why?"". Without a vision, you can ask ""how?"" all you want but won't be able to pick the correct answer between various options. **We must consider that we all are still early adopters: what we invest in actually matters**, it might actually change the trajectory of the future. Most people still do not hold or interact with crypto even though there's superbowl ads for it.

As an example, I often here Monero fans talk about how Monero is everything Bitcoin claims to be. They say it brings privacy and autonomy like Bitcoin used to claim, it brings decentralization like Bitcoin claims to, and that it better fits the ethos behind Bitcoin. And it's hard to ignore those points, they have some validity, only a true die-hard ""maxi"" would say they are irrelevant. I say this as somebody who holds both, making room for nuance is important. Yet **we have so much tribal infighting and gains-chasing that we fail to see, focus, and collaborate on all the real, tangible good that crypto and web3 could bring to the world**. There are many coins which are awesome and bring unique things to the table, but simply don't get the coverage because they lack the hype or the VC backing or the promise of quick short-term gains.

As another example, there are some remarkable things happening in the DeSci space. There are blockchains that threaten to upend the way that scientific research is funded, published, shared, and capitalized on, to ""decentralize"" the production of science much in the same way that open source did to software development, to produce a **patent-free warchest of drugs and treatments for humanity**. This literally is *already happening*, a few months back a volunteer computing project Folding@home [discovered and published](https://np.reddit.com/r/cryptoforscience/comments/sl1ory/covid_moonshot_project_discovers_new_antiviral/) new patent-free antiviral for covid which it set to enter human trials in a year. Many of you are familiar with Banano which incentivizes participation in folding@home and is in fact the top team there. Yet the DeSci topic rarely makes the front page here even though there's a half-dozen coins in it, some of which like Gridcoin have been around since 2013, long before 90% of the coins mentioned on the front page. Or the coin backed by the CEO of Coinbase (Brian Armstrong) called Research Coin which is used to incentivize participation in an online science journal of sorts called [ResearchHub](http://researchhub.com).

And none of this even touches on the ways that blockchain technology is going to be used to change the way that democracies and governments function. Liquid voting, participatory budgeting, transparent legislative processes, oh my!

**I am excited about crypto for the same reasons I always have been: because it is a technology that can fundamentally change the world for the better, and I am proud to be here as an early adopter with all of you.** But as Vitalik and Edward Snowden point out, they also contain the mechanisms for turnkey fascism. If we always chase gains as our ""why"", that is likely where we will end up.

So I guess I am just encouraging you to ask yourself why crypto is exciting, because I think for a lot of you it is more than the ""how"" and more than the candle charts. What we invest in now will determine the future, so it's an important question to ask. We can chase gains, of course, but let's also encourage each other to ask questions, learn from each other, and ask why."|0.52|1|0|1

I'm not an expert, and what I've written isn't comprehensive. My suggestions aren't the only answers to these issues. There's no discussion in here about cryptos themselves, and regular users may not find much of anything new. I don't know shit about fuck, but I enjoy writing about this stuff. I hope it can help people. Please share your conventional wisdom with new users.  

I have several chapters to this that I'm going to release one at a time since they're so damn long.  

tdlr: Security is no longer free. Strong security takes effort, and hardware.  

# Email Security is First &amp; Foremost

It's vital that your email is as secure as possible. If your email is compromised, you can't reliably secure anything else. Lose your email security in today's very advanced threat environment and it might take you years to recover. There are endless stories of this happening. Identity theft, email scams and tojan-links, phone scammers with perfectly copied email templates of corporate crypto exchanges, and URLs that are super close to the real thing. Physical security for your email won't stop you from clicking links, but it will definitely halt any further damage and allow you to reset your passwords and rebuild your OS if your comprimised. 

Any company or government agency etc is going to use your email address as the primary means of confirming many things. The only other means of legit correspondence with anyone is via snail-mail, USPS. You don't want to do a snail mail reset of your assets if you can possibly avoid it. Seriously, you just have no idea how hard it gets to recover information and identity. And virtually nobody is going to help you.

### Security Keys are The Way

The fastest and easiest way to secure email is to use a hardware security key. You will need to purchase one from a reliable vendor. The two most commonly used are;

* [Google Titan](https://store.google.com/us/product/titan_security_key)
* [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com/products/)

The Google Titan keys are reportedly made by Yubico, but there's little or no difference in pricing, but compare for your own reference and DYOR. 

Don't use the excuse that $30-50 is too much money to spend, especially if you have more than $30-50 worth of assets. Also, there are some Yubicos that are cheaper so you choose what works for you. For the pedantically minded among you, this plan obviously requires 2 keys. A primary and a backup key is the best approach. It's a simple and effective type of insurance. Using a hardware key stops virtually all types of malicious access to your email. Once you have one and set it up, nobody can get into your email. A sim swap attack, mobile device loss, computer malware, key logger, or even a compromised password are useless if you are using a hardware key! No hardware key, no entry, it's as simple as that. You cannot access the email without the key, and this includes mobile devices. 

Modern mobile phones have security keys built into them for convenience, but you don't have to use them that way, you can enable an external security key that you place close to the back of the mobile phone for secured access rather than relying on the built-in key.

As you may be aware, the convenience of simple, reused, old passwords absolutely fucked up a lot of people. There are no simple passwords any longer! Get over it. It takes effort to secure your shit from the massive industry of thievery that ***is*** the modern Internet. Check out this chart. 

https://preview.redd.it/a1g5lzxlqom91.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac072f468c6df955cdea7738d587974640eaa539

### MfA &gt; 2fA

Many banks, and financial institutions, as well as business websites, will let you secure your login with a hardware key, but unfortunately, it seems like the most common big corporations don't allow it. My giant American bank still doesn't have a good MfA option. Those that don't have that option, will usually allow you to use a 2 Factor Authentication(2fA) app. 2fA is an awesome powerful tool when used to form a Multi-factor Authentication (MfA) security chain for online activities. This is only good as long as you can back up your 2FA app. The two most useful are;

* Google Authenticator
* [Twilio Authy](https://authy.com/)

I started with Goole authenticator but realized after a couple of years that without a way to back up the app, I would be fucked if I lost my mobile or broke it. So I switched to Authy. Authy works exactly the same way, and it has encrypted backups. I've noticed sites will use the terms ""Google Authenticator"" and make the setup look like it only works for Google. Authy does work. Try it. If you decide to use Authy and a website makes it look like Google, just use the Authy app exactly the same way. Either app works fine when the 2FA widget is a six-digit OTC.

Don't be like me start with the Authy app and stick to it. It took me several caffeine-fueled, hair-pulling days to make the switch from G to A, but it was worth the peace of mind. [There are other 2fA OTC apps](https://geekflare.com/two-factor-authentication-apps/), so DYOR or just use Authy ffs.

### Multi-factor Authentication (MfA)

Multi-factor Authentication is the absolute best way to manage your bank accounts, trading accounts, and digital assets, including crypto wallets. Most Central Exchanges(CEX) allow you and/or possibly require you to use MfA in the process of changing the state of your account. This process can be somewhat customized to use a combination of the 2FA app, and your email to create strong MfA practices. I wish more exchanges would implement security keys but we're not quite there yet. 

Nonetheless, taking the MfA approach to crypto wallets, not just 2fA, will stop 99% of all malicious attempts to manipulate your shit. Yes, it can be a pain in the ass. But losing your asset is a much more painful experience! I'll touch on this in more detail in the Whitelisting explanation in another post. The basic premise here is to use the options for MfA everywhere you can. Scamming, trojans and sophisticated phishing attacks aren't going to stop or get easier to stop. In fact I feel it's the opposite, and it's just going to get worse. Develop the MfA process for yourself. Buy a couple of cheap Yubico keys. Secure your email and all the other security methods becomes less of a burden. Nonetheless, take everything with a grain of salt and stay wary of anything that seems free.

t3_x99yhd|1662666855|CryptoCurrency|More optimistic case for PoS chains now with all the mayhem on climate. May not be a great road ahead for Bitcoin.|"Every part of this world is struggling right now with the climate change and governments will need to take very drastic steps soon. They do when they have to (especially when electoral chances are at risk) - a good proof is Fed rate hikes in US - it‚Äôs still going strong and beyond anyone ever expected.

This could be a horrible situation for Bitcoin but a massive opportunity for Ethereum with its upcoming PoS migration. If Governments do take drastic actions and ERGs get more strict, we may witness an Ethereum Bitcoin flip and ETH becoming the most valued chain. Of course, other blockchains on PoS consensus will do well especially - Solana.

This may not be a bad thing. If Bitcoin is not good for environment, the foundation needs to do something about it. So glad ETH is just on time for the PoS migration.

Every  now and then, I see a lot of people getting scammed by scammers (may  the rot in hell). Just thought of jotting down some tips to keep your  funds safu.

We have an influx of new members here in this sub, and thought this would be helpful for them.

1. NEVER EVER share your seed phrase OR password with anyone.
2. NEVER indulge in chat with people who slide into your DMs to help you. These are 99.99% of times the scammers we need to be wary of.
3. If you are facing any issues with wallet, contact the team through official channels. Post on the coin's sub and do not accept any chat invites from people who say they are from support. If they want to help you, let them help you out in the public forum.
4. DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT please for the love of God DO NOT click random links given by users.
5. DO NOT put all your eggs in one basket, meaning do not have all your coins in one wallet. Even if one wallet is compromised, you still wont lose everything.
6. If your coins are on an exchange, please turn on 2FA. Google authenticator OR Authy is more safe compared to SMS authentication.
7. Never tell anyone how much you have invested in crypto. (Or any other  investment. No good will come out by divulging that information out  there)
8. Whenever you‚Äôre copying your wallet address or memo, double triple check your address after you paste it. There are some viruses that change the  address when you paste it.

t3_x995rm|1662665062|CryptoCurrency|Is doomsday coming for many alts? The SEC will likely rule almost every alt as a security|"Anyone who has been in this space for a while knows of the difficult relationship between crypto and the SEC, which stands for the Securities and Exchange Comission. The SEC is an independent government body government regulatory agency responsible for protecting investors, maintaining fair and orderly functioning of the securities markets,¬†and facilitating capital formation. For clarity, a security is ""a fungible, negotiable financial instrument that represents some type of financial value, usually in the form of a stock, bond, or option.""

A lot of the discussion has been concerned with which crypto tokens are securities and which are not, because the SEC is the federal regulator of the securities market. Quite some time ago, the SEC claimed that XRP is a security on 22 December 2020. That case is still ongoing and the SEC has been delaying it heavily. What happened to XRP? Well, after it was deemed a security, it went about -70% within a week and never really recovered (back then it was #3 in market cap):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lw0hjypdoom91.png?width=382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a1b6acdc62d73935b0c93b6c7326050322a6a77

There have been other instances of the SEC highlighting projects as securities. Recently, for instance, the SEC said that 9 projects were securities, namely: AMP, RLY, DDX, XYO, RGT, LCX, POWR, DFX and KROM. These tokens have not done very well relative to the rest of the market (e.g. AMP is bleeding out).

Now, it is entirely unclear what the SEC views as a security in the crypto space, because clear guidelines are missing. However, they are creating these guidelines, and the SEC will ""soon"" rule which token is a security and which is not. Gary Gensler said: ""that the CFTC will regulate spot + futures for non-security tokens, and the SEC will regulate spot + issuance of tokens that are securities"". This is consistent with the incoming bill of several senators. What does this mean? Sam Bankman-Fried from FTX writes:

https://preview.redd.it/0xydsff5pom91.png?width=590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b036ffa4b69a51a0ac1f09773407c33a14982d21

So BTC and its forks (e.g. Bitcoin Cash) and ETH and its forks are likely safe. But many other coins are on the chopping block. Many tokens will likely be ruled as securities and it is possible that this could have the same effect as it did on XRP, in essence shifting money away from those projects ruled as securities to those projects ruled as not being securities.

What do *you* expect to be ruled as a security and what not? How big wil the effect be on this space?"|0.79|137|0|137

Leveraging the immutable, transparent and auditable nature of blockchain technology, CABA (Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires) is looking to take welfare and social security to the digital age (Something they have been pushing for decades now, but that given the shitty nature of our public services was always hit or miss **despite them sinking millions of pesos into the inititative**).  


**It was also proposed to utilize Blockchain for the public tender process** behind public works, a process that has also historically been riddled with favoritism, insider manipulation and nepotism (Despite what any goverment official could say to deny it). This proposition was passed and signed by Dario Nieto from the Vamos Juntos political party.   


This is the same legislator that proposed blockchain be used for social security and pension system, alegating that within our national social security system there's **140 distinct welfare initiatives** (such as the **Alimentar card** where you get monthly deposits for groceries, or **Potenciar Trabajo** where they deduct tax on employers for hiring low income workers), **costing a yearly budget of 700.000.000 pesos**.  


Personally, as an Argentinian, I feel this is just *bread &amp; circus*. This would strip political parties from having the final say in all things welfare, something that has been historically abused to launder money and outright steal from public treasuries. Am I supposed to believe for a second they're willing to shoot themselves in the foot for the good of the masses? Nah, smh.   


To give you a clear cut picture of how our welfare is abused, i'll use the Potenciar Trabajo initiative as an example: Basically, employers get a tax cut for every low income employer they hire, and these low income workers get paid a bonus by the goverment as to complement their salaries. In practice, **a minuscule part of the target demographic signed into the initiative since they can make just as much money by not working at all, receiving welfare and then having an informal job on the side**. Basically, they behave as parasites, draining public funds while providing absolutely nothing back to society. Now imagine this happens on a massive scale. Yes, we're **that fucked**.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you guys think? IMO it's a good idea on paper, it could be used to excert Orwellian control over citizens, if it works at all, probably on an actually serious country where corrupt goverment officials get shunned instead of glorified and cult bound.

What are some arguments for and against?|"With the Ethereum merge coming up soon, I began pondering about the future of crypto as a whole. The most substantial obstacle that I can see the market facing is energy usage and environmental impact as adoption continues to grow. As ETH began to scale, and more transactions took place on the blockchain, it became abundantly clear that Proof of Stake is superior to Proof of Work.  
  
Going forward, I‚Äôm slightly worried about Bitcoin adoption given the blockchain‚Äôs inability to move to PoS. However, I‚Äôm relatively new to the space so maybe there is a crucial argument for Bitcoin even though its energy consumption will continue to grow. Since environmentalism is part of the foundation of any political platform, it seems evident that any politician would be much more inclined to support PoS chains in order to reduce the carbon footprint of crypto as a whole, giving people more reason to move out of Bitcoin into PoS assets.

t3_x982ia|1662661522|CryptoCurrency|Moons as native currency on own blockchain|As I'm sure most of you know, RCPs, including Moons, switched to the mainnet last month. This change has meant that you can no longer, without having Ethereum in your Vault, use Moons as a tipping currency. In addition, Moons have hardly any applications in which you can use them so far. Probably applications will eventually come where you can use your Moons, in my eyes. However, my question is why arbitrum nova was chosen as the blockchain for the RCP and the Moons were not given their own blockchain. This own blockchain could have been built on top of cosmos sdk for example, so no blockchain would have had to be developed from scratch. Furthermore, this blockchain could have been linked to other blockchains in a timely manner through the cosmos sdk (I don't want to advertise cosmos or the cosmos sdk here, they only serve as an example) to attract other usecases besides just sending the native currency. On a separate blockchain, the moons could have been used as a native currency to pay transaction fees. Do any of you know the reasons that drove the team behind RCPs to create the coins on arb nova and not create a separate blockchain for it? Transaction fees on a new blockchain with moons as the native currency should also be relatively low in the early days without large applications, shouldn't they? Maybe a native Moons blockchain can still be implemented?|0.71|11|0|11

The way the merge will start is actually really interesting and ***best explanation I can find is on a stackoverflow*** question, source here: [https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/133429/what-exactly-will-trigger-the-merge](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/133429/what-exactly-will-trigger-the-merge) 

Basically the block that is mined with a total difficulty exceeding what they call as the terminal total difficulty TTD ( as it stands it is 58750000000000000000000 ) will trigger the Proof of Stake consensus to take over block production, this is the beacon chain.

Lots of info already but to sum it up.

The merge will NOT reduce gas fees nor will it increase transaction time however it most likely increase staking APR and No there will not be a a complete breakdown due to withdrawal since this function is not set to kick in until later and I guess staggered.

**Note: I did not do any of these calculations and al the hard work was from the authors** \- I just aggregated and took the average. Even the idea of the taking the average was inspired by a question here where someone ask if there was an average of all the estimates- can't link since it triggers a auto removal.

 *Tl;dr: Coinbase is funding a lawsuit brought by six people challenging the U.S. Treasury Department‚Äôs sanctions of the Tornado Cash smart contracts and asking the Court to remove them from the U.S. sanctions list. The sanctions exceed Treasury‚Äôs authority, harm innocent people, remove privacy and security options for crypto users, and stifle innovation.* 

&amp;#x200B;

***By Brian Armstrong, CEO and Cofounder***

Today we‚Äôre announcing that Coinbase is funding a lawsuit brought by six people challenging the United States Treasury Department‚Äôs sanctions of the Tornado Cash smart contracts and asking the Court to remove them from the U.S. sanctions list.

Tornado Cash is an open source piece of software running on the Ethereum blockchain that preserves privacy by allowing users to deposit assets from one crypto address and withdraw them using a different crypto address.

Last month, Treasury sanctioned the Tornado Cash software because it was being used by criminals ‚Äî including North Korean hackers. We have no issue with the Treasury sanctioning bad actors and we take a hard stance against unlawful behavior. But in this case, Treasury went much further and took the unprecedented step of sanctioning an entire technology instead of specific individuals. The problem here is twofold: (1) there are legitimate applications for this type of technology and as a result of these sanctions, many innocent users now have their funds trapped and have lost access to a critical privacy tool, and (2) we believe the Treasury exceeded its authority, given by Congress, by sanctioning a technology.

At Coinbase, we‚Äôve been fighting illicit activity since the very beginning, and while we share Treasury‚Äôs commitment to fighting crime, we believe this action harms innocent people and threatens the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) and web3 specifically.

## Treasury used a hammer instead of a scalpel

The nature of the blockchain ‚Äî where every transaction is public ‚Äî makes crypto more secure. But it can also create privacy concerns. If you receive your salary in crypto, for example, you might not want the world to know how much money you make, or how you choose to spend it.

That‚Äôs why the individuals we‚Äôre supporting in this case used Tornado Cash in the first place:

* One person used Tornado Cash to anonymously donate money to Ukraine. Afterwards, his wallet received potentially malicious air drops. But because he anonymized his crypto before donating, he avoided attacks against his personal accounts. He has funds trapped in Tornado Cash.
* Another person is an early crypto adopter with a large online presence and a public ENS name linked to his Twitter profile. He used Tornado Cash to protect his personal security while transacting. Now he also has funds trapped in Tornado Cash.
* A third person operates an Etherum staking business. At one point, a stranger working near where he engages in staking asked how much money he was earning. He started using Tornado Cash to protect his assets and his personal safety.

Sanctioning open source software is like permanently shutting down a highway because robbers used it to flee a crime scene. It‚Äôs not the best way to solve a problem. It ends up punishing people who did nothing wrong and results in people having less privacy and security.

We believe law abiding citizens have a right to privacy, especially with some of their most sensitive data: their finances.

## Treasury acted outside its authority

The second problem is that, while Treasury is allowed to sanction people (along with their property), Congress never gave it the power to sanction open source software. That‚Äôs why these plaintiffs are going to court to ask that this software be removed from the U.S. sanctions list. You can read more about our legal argument [here](https://blog.coinbase.com/sanctions-should-target-bad-actors-not-technology-cb541ac6839a).

## This will stifle innovation

Finally, sanctioning open-source code has a chilling effect on innovation.

Right now, developers are worried that they could be held responsible for something they had nothing to do with, and no ability to control. At a time when we should be encouraging innovation, this kind of fear and uncertainty will do the opposite ‚Äî making developers wonder if, by pushing the industry forward, they could be putting themselves at risk.

As one of the largest companies in crypto, we have a responsibility to defend the crypto industry against actions that go too far, and treat crypto on an uneven playing field. It‚Äôs not enough to just say we disagree and sit on the sidelines. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre funding and supporting this lawsuit.

We will fully comply with the law while we await the court‚Äôs decision. But we‚Äôre hopeful that these sanctions will be reversed, allowing innocent crypto users to regain access to their funds and making it possible for anyone to use privacy tools to protect themselves.

I came back into the space in spring 2020 and have been deep into it ever since. I remember seeing ETH reach 2K, 3K, then 4K and was of course FOMOing in. I dreamed of prices below 2K, and BTC prices below 50K. I thought I had missed my opportunity of a lifetime. 

Fast forward to today - BTC is sub 20K and ETH is sub 2K, below 1.5K at times and even hitting triple digits. The crypto fear &amp; greed index is at 20 again - extreme fear. These are prices I thought I would never see again. The opportunity of a lifetime is back. 

All of us here are holding in the likely bear market and weathering the storm. And it couldn't be a better time. Societal wide adoption is still extremely low. With 21 mil BTC that could ever exist, mass adoption over the next few years would create a demand could be unfathomable. Ethereum is about to merge from PoW to PoS, and will do wonders for further adoption and development for crypto as a whole. The future demand could be outrageous compared to today. 

Yet as the prices today remain well below ATH, there is so much promise for growth and adoption, and so much to be bullish for. This presents another ""opportunity of a lifetime"". Sure this is not like the opportunities before, but it's gonna be one hell of a ride. And I'm glad all of us who have remained in this space with that deep-seeded optimism get to be here for it this time around."|0.73|38|0|38

It was just like ""yesterday"" when my dreams of growing big with LUNA (or should I say LUNC) crumbled with the May 2022 crash. I had about $4,000 worth of LUNA at that time, cutting across Binance and MEXCGlobal. It happened like the fall of a ""pack of cards"" . I felt like my whole world had crumbled around me. Very desolate, I was but stayed true to the cause of LUNA (now LUNC). There was nothing to savour at the time - I mean from $120 to $0.00000099 was like falling  from ""grace to grass"". 
I braced myself up and bought $100 worth of LUNC.
Then MEXC came with the first round of buyback and burn initiative. I immediately made some huge bucks overnight and I was like ""this crash could be a blessing in disguise"" courtesy of the exchange and the undying loyalty to the project by who we now call the ""LUNATICs"".

Now, down the road, here they come again with another lifeline yet again from MEXC. And it has yielded a lot of gains with a total of 119 million LUNC burnt already and an attendant rise of more than 200% in the last couple of days. This singular and undying support by a CEX needs to be celebrated without which we could probably be contemplating worst case financial and psychological impacts but here we are, smiling again.
And to add to that, I learnt this MEXC burn could be extended if the 1.2% tax on-chain burn proposal finally got approved by the community. I just can't imagine the scale of ROI at that time!!!"|0.45|0|0|0

I am not a total beginner but definitely a newbie and hoping someone can answer a couple of beginner's questions for me. I have a basic trading app on my phone called Luno, which contains a little crypto. I'd like to transfer the balances to a different app, with more features (Coinbase). I see that it is possible to transfer crypto from Luno to different wallet addresses, but that's where things start to get confusing. In oder to transfer the crypto from Luno to Coinbase, do I:

a) Send the crypto from its existing wallets in the Luno app to newly created wallets in the Coinbase app? Or:

b) Just give Coinbase access to the existing wallets?

Two bonus questions if I may :D

c) Am I right in thinking you cannot store different types of crypto in the same wallets? You couldn't, for example, store Bitcoin and Ethereum in the same wallet - or am I totally off base there?

d) A different wallet app I looked at (Zerion) offers users a free (basic) NFT, but when I tried to claim that, it stated that a crypto balance was required to pay gas fees. I understand what gas fees are, but the app very confusingly didn't specify how much would be needed to claim the NFT - why be unhelpfully mysterious about that? Am I missing something?

Any input gratefully received !"|0.6|1|0|1

I also previously made posts about this topic and you can check previous posts for further info. Most of the sources are also included. Other sources are on previous posts.

As a general reiteration, virtually all countries around the world are struggling to fight inflation as well as being hit hard by the effects of climate change. There is high single to double-digit inflation in almost every country you look at. There are massive floods, droughts and high temperatures that are crushing economies, by drying up some of the most key waterways in the world such as the Rhine in Germany, the Yangtze in China, the Danube in Western Europe and the Colarado River in the US. Entire sections of these rivers have dried up that are causing companies to decrease or outright halt operations.

Russia has stopped pipeline flows of natural gas to Europe, having provided 40% of Europe's energy pre-war. They say flows will not resume until Europe lifts sanctions meaning that they have lost almost half of their energy from a cheap and convenient energy source. Neither of the sides are likely to bend to the either, meaning that Europe is about to face winter while having their main source of heating and energy cut off. It is to the point that classrooms in Normandy, France have begun arrangements to heat their classroom with *wood.* French companies have to submit plans to reduce their energy usage by 10%. German energy bills are set to increase by around 500 euros a year while Germany is expected to lose 225 billion over the next two years if gas flows stay halted. OFGEM, the UK energy regulator, has already increased energy price caps by 80%, with room for further raises if necessary as UK energy bills a projected to cost twice the monthly wage in 2023. Similar stories continue across Europe. EU states have agreed to cut energy usage by 15%, a measure that will suffocate the economies across Europe.

China, **the worlds largest exporter,** is going through a Lehman Crisis moment as youth employment is almost 20%. There was a theft of 6 billion from customers through the banking system and there are now widespread protests and customers are refusing to pay mortgages and effectively defaulting as real estate companies are themselves heavily overleveraged and out of cash. Two real estate companies have begun what is expected to be a wave of defaults. Meanwhile, China continues its mass lockdowns at any hint of COVID. There have now recently been arrests of dozens of individuals related to the banking theft. There are now reports of banks restricting withdrawals to only a few hundred yuan(few dozens USD). In the crypto space, we all know what withdrawal restrictions mean.

A recent industry-wide issue has now just occurred that European energy companies face 1.5 **trillion** euros(same amount in USD) in margin calls. How this occurs is that companies generally hedge their business operations in case of some systemic risk like floods for an agricultural company. This means that even if there are floods you have bought some sort of insurance so you don't lose everything if your business is heavily affected. Basically, all your eggs are not in one basket. However, since Russia has cut off gas flows the companies that provide this insurance have in effect raised the premium and energy companies have to pay more for the insurance. In a time of massive inflation and high rates by banks these energy companies have to find even more funds. And as usual, all these costs get passed right back onto the consumer, the little guy. So the already terrible energy bills are going to go even higher. This can be mitigated if the governments decide to spend millions to subsidise citizens, but then we know that game. All the money governments spend to help citizens come right back to bite them through inflation, at a time of *already* super high inflation rates. There is no way out of this.

All of this meanwhile countries continue to struggle to feed themselves as grains, that account for 45% of the world's diet, and around 25% of which comes from Russia and Ukraine. Food supplies are further reduced by the aforementioned climate and environmental issues where temperatures are either too high or too low as well as the effects of drought causing crop failures. This is sure to affect developing countries.

Another factor for developing countries is a lack of foreign exchange. Fed is continuing interest rate increases and the dollar is still skyrocketing in value and so further reducing supply. Developing economies need forex to survive which is precisely why they are called developing. The manufacturing and production are weak and most economies work by simply buying goods from foreign markets and selling them locally. But forex is needed to buy the foreign goods initially, forex that is very low in supply.

The US has already shown weakness and signs of recession from asset prices, to lay-offs to the unemployment rate and the rise of multiple job-holders and continued Federal Reserve rate increases, massively increasing consumer debt levels and loan default by prime borrowers. I dove into these already on previous posts. I called the crash from around \~$25,000 in these earlier posts as well.

Open interest in top tokens has also surged in anticipation of the merge. Exchanges are seeing record short interest in top tokens.

I am not calling anybody out. I am not insulting anybody. I am just saying that while yes markets might be a casino, at this point this ain't a game anymore. At this point, if you know you can't afford to lose what you have in, take out what you must from the market. Where we are right now, things look bad and have much room to get worse. If you are into shorting tokens you may have a good time, but otherwise, the signs look downright catastrophic.

The article basically said that wealthy Westerners could use cheap labor coming from third world countries to populate their metaverse worlds. 

I think that would be a fabulous idea for a few reasons. 

1.) It creates new jobs. Jobs that are hopefully not exploited by their Bosses by paying them very little. The NPCs in their metaverse world will come from NFTs played and loaned to them by their bosses. 

2.) It opens up a whole new world of gaming. 

-You can just hang out in a plaza in that world and talk to ""NPCs"". 

-There could also be bartenders, stripper NFTs, etc which are played by real life human NPCs. 


Most humans love to interact and adding these in games will give players new incentives to play NFT games.

t3_x8xnwv|1662635481|CryptoCurrency|Now that we're in a bear market, is anyone actually still using your blockchain?|"I love metrics. So I am constantly analysing data to compare and validate my theories on which blockchains and projects will survive and demonstrate the most upside potential. One metric, I look at often is the daily active users. It's a great metric to tell whether the chain is being used.

**What are Daily Active Users?**

This is simply the number of addresses on the blockchain that perform at least one transaction on a particular day. If there are 1000 addresses sending transaction, then that implies 1000 people used the blockchain.

**Why is it important?**

A blockchain will be successful if people are using it. That is an obvious assertion. If lots of people are making transactions, then the project has inherent utility. If its being effectively used during a bear market, then *there is potential for great upside during a bull run*.

**Why compare to the November highs?**

During the peak of the bullrun, we saw enormous take up and investment in crypto. Millions of new users creating their accounts, interacting with the blockchain, experimenting with dApps etc. It was sometimes difficult to find the data for the exact date, so all results were taken on or close to 10 November 2021, as this was the date of Bitcoin's all time high.

By comparing the current daily users to that date, we can ascertain a decent perspective on which users decided to stick around, or perhaps even which projects are still attracting new users, despite the bear market.

**What data could be missing?**

An obvious hole is that this shows the blockchain data only. Any transactions made on exchanges will not be counted towards the daily active users.

Another possible gap in the data comes from the impact of bots. Many blockchains have bots performing automated tasks, and these appear the same as any other user.

The date I chose was base don the Bitcoin price, and likely doesn't perfectly coincide with the all time highest daily active users on any particular chain - that could of course occur any day.

**Examples:**

The following is an examples are for Polkadot and Avalanche. I checked the published statistics on the [Polkadot](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=account) and [Avalanche](https://stats.avax.network/dashboard/overview/) websites, and then compared them to data on Messari and/or Glassnode. This is the same thing I did to complete the table below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I will reserve judgement for now as to which projects show more or less potential for value increase based on their daily active users only. Suffice it to say, obviously for a project to become successful, adoption is key.

How does your project choice measure up? If you are concerned about your investments, check the numbers against several other sources. Messari would be another good place to start.

Which means, the KYC tokens cannot be moved to another wallet. Binance calls it Binance Account Bound (BAB) token. Binance claims this will be the proof of identification for a user's wallet, will help in preventing bots, verifying users for governance voting etc.

This serves no real purpose other than an attempt to comply with government over reach. Governments want every crypto transaction to be tracked to user's real world identity. The whole concept is antithetical to crypto's principles of pseudo-anonymity. 

Such schemes are open to all kinds of misuse. Binance itself had a KYC breach few years ago, which they then denied and claimed was not true. 

[https://www.theblock.co/post/8040/a-darknet-vendor-is-allegedly-selling-images-and-data-associated-with-crypto-exchange-identity-verification-processes](https://www.theblock.co/post/8040/a-darknet-vendor-is-allegedly-selling-images-and-data-associated-with-crypto-exchange-identity-verification-processes)

Now Binance claims independent DeFi projects can verify users KYC by using the BAB token. There is no need for any DeFi project to verify user's onchain KYC. If there is, whats the difference between defi vs regular banking? None of the top Defi dapps even require any kind of KYC verification. Many top DAOs including Maker, Compound, Aave have pseudonymous DAO members in governance too. 

Such moves coming from the largest exchanges are pretty sad. They are just submitting to the whims of government. Looking at this, now every other government will also impose such requirements. As of now, Binance claims BAB token are just optional, but its not far fetched to think they will be made mandatory. 

Binance is just giving governments another tool to mount a new surveillance state against crypto users. Pretty pathetic from Binance. 

When governments start demanding other exchanges also do this, remember this nonsense was kick started by Binance.

Edit: Reply guy calling this ""Smart Move"" is beyond dumb. By what logic is this a ""smart move""? Thanks to this precedent by Binance, soon government will mandate DEX to allow only addresses that have a soulbound NFT, so that they can track your every move.

t3_x8v23b|1662626754|CryptoCurrency|Miners can't just move somewhere else: They are price takers|"I've seen a lot of people repeating the idea that Ethereum miners will simply move to some other PoW chain to mine on when the merge completes. However, this represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the way that mining rewards work.

## The key takeaway: It is the _developers of a PoW chain_ that decide _how much to pay_ for security. It is **NOT** the miners who decide _how much to **charge**_, they are simply **price takers**, who harvest whatever fixed rewards the developers have decided to set.

Specifically, effectively every PoW chain has a mostly fixed issuance model (ignoring transaction fees which are still a very small portion of rewards), where a predictable number of tokens are issued as part of each block mined: Whether a **hundred** or a _hundred thousand_ people are mining Bitcoin, it makes no difference, blocks are mined at the same rate and pay out the same amount of Bitcoin either way. That is, _the amount_ that the Bitcoin blockchain is paying for security is **exactly the same** no matter how many miners choose to join or leave the network. The same is true for other PoW chains.

The further implication is that when the merge completes, there are simply going to be **less total mining rewards available** in the crypto space as a whole. The existing Ethereum mining rewards don't ""move somewhere else"", they _straight up cease to exist_. The **only** three ways for more mining rewards to become available are:

1. Additional PoW chains are created

2. Existing PoW chains change their issuance model

3. The value of the tokens on existing PoW chains goes up

----

&gt; _What about a (new) PoW fork of Ethereum popping up, doesn't that fall under number 2?_

Yes, however it doesn't appreciably change the amount of rewards available. 

Or at least it would be unprecedented for that to happen, as historically every fork has very quickly resolved to one side being worth &gt;90% and the other being worth &lt;10%, which would still remove most of the existing rewards available unless the PoW fork wins over PoS Ethereum (which is almost impossible for a number of reasons such as stablecoin mechanics that I won't go into here).

----

&gt; _What about number 3, wouldn't miners moving to other chains change the sell pressure on those chains?_

This is another thing I think people have missed the key point on: People are **already mining on those other chains**. There's little reason to believe that the migrating Ethereum miners would make substantially different hold / sell choices with the tokens they mine than the existing miners do.

That's because the vast majority of mining is done at scale by people who effectively treat it as a business. If you're treating it as a business then you likely don't have any particular attachment to the tokens you're mining, you just mine wherever the profits are.

And if the hold / sell choices of the miners remain the same on those other chains... way more miners joining won't change the amount of sell pressure whatsoever: The same amount of tokens are being rewarded per block and the same percentage of them are being sold regardless of the number of miners / hashrate.

----

**TL;DR**: There's gonna be a whole lot of cheap graphics cards out there in a couple weeks. Like... even cheaper than they already are."|0.76|27|0|27

\- Transition from a POW¬†consensus is likely to flood the crypto industry with out-of-work ETH miners, causing severe disruption to all PoW token (Hoping for a positive disruption).

\- PoW miners will be forced to look for greener pastures, such as other PoW blockchains, and thus ""swamp‚Äù other coins ‚Äî increasing mining difficulty and reducing profitability (I wouldn‚Äôt want this).

\- Hash rate will flow to alternative GPU PoW coins, and many miners will simply give up and try to sell off their farms of cards.

\- If it‚Äôs super successful ETH will chip away some of BTC‚Äôs dominance.

One scenario has started to play out as GPU prices and demand¬†have already been declining as a result of falling BTC price, leading to some cards¬†selling¬†for below the list price and sellers struggling to offload their mining rigs and cards for inflated prices.

**How to avoid it:** Don't trust anyone who offers you free stuff. Don't share your seed phrase or personal info with anyone.

**Fake versions of popular apps, browser extensions and exchange websites.**

**How it  works:** You click a link that installs/visits a replica version of the real thing, which will send your passwords and personal info to scammers and/or sneak in scammer wallet addresses when you're transferring crypto.

**How to avoid it:** Only install apps, wallets and extensions from the official website; triple check any website addresses for anything crypto related. If you use google don't click on the ""ad"" version of websites, as   scammers sometimes pay for their scam version to show up there.

**Pump and Dump Groups**

**How it works:** You join a group that claims they will pump a coin to dump on the general public for a profit, however the organisers have already filled their bags and dump on the group instead when they release the name of the coin.

**How to avoid it**: Now you know what it looks like you can avoid it.

**SIM swap**

**How it works:** Scammers use personal info to trick your phone company into transferring your number to their SIM, then use your phone + personal info to gain access to emails, crypto exchanges and more.

**How to avoid it:** Always use an Authenticator based 2FA instead of phone, and don't link email addresses to your phone. Never reveal the phone number / email address attached to your crypto accounts.

**Gas trap**

**How it works:** Someone posts the seed to a wallet full of tokens; in order to take the tokens you need to transfer crypto to the wallet to pay for gas; they have a bot that takes your crypto straight away.

**How to avoid it:** Don't trust anyone giving you free stuff.

**Fake Givaways**

**How it works:** Someone advertises through the web or social media that they are giving away crypto ‚Äì you just have to give them your crypto or personal information first. In reality there is no givaway.

**How to avoid it:** Research who is running the contest. Generally people don‚Äôt give things out for free. If in doubt, it‚Äôs fine to miss out.

# Malware

**Clipboard Hacks**

**How it works:** Malware takes the crypto address you copied to the clipboard and replaces it with the scammer's address, so your crypto gets sent to the scammer.

**How to avoid it:** Triple check the address you're sending crypto to, if you find you've been compromised, a full reformat + factory reset is the best option. Change all crypto passwords, email passwords, new authenticator on separate device. Move coins to a new wallet.

**Fake ledger**

**How it works:** Someone sells you a fake ledger or trezor which is loaded with Malware. As soon as you load it up with crypto they steal it. 

**How to avoid it:** Never buy cold storage second hand; order directly from Ledger or Trezor and triple check that your package has not been tampered with.    

# Coin scams

**Rug Pull / Exit scam**

**How it works:** Developers of a shitcoin spend months shilling their coin &amp; paying influencers to shill their coin. Eventually they dump their bags or drain liquidity pools taking everyone's money and the coin's value goes to zero.

**How to avoid it:** Thoroughly research every coin you invest in, make sure the developer team are doxxed and are trustoworthy. Don't buy any coins shilled by influencers. 

**Ponzi/Pyramid coins**

**How it works:** These coins promise high returns or high gains, usually they involve deflationary tokenomics or other tricks to get people interested, all the price gain however is through other investors, there's no actual product or service associated with the coin and the price will eventually collapse.

**How to avoid it:** Thoroughly research coins before investing - check out some of the DYOR guides that have been posted on Reddit.

**Fake coins**

**How it works:** Scammers create a coin with a similar name or ticker code to another popular coin, or the same name on a different chain, and you end up buying the fake coin instead of the real one.

**How to avoid it:** Check the coin you want is offered on the exchange you're using, triple check the name of the coin your buying and the chain you're buying it on.

**Honeypot coin**

**How it works:** A hot new token is pumping and up 100% already. As soon as you buy some you'll see paper gains but you'll never be able to sell, only a select few people are given permission to sell the coin in the smart contract and you're not one of them.

**How to avoid it:** Thoroughly research any product before you invest. 

# Other

**Dusting attack**

**How it works:** Someone sends you trace amounts of crypto in the hope that you‚Äôll   transfer it, revealing the address of other wallets that belong to you.

**How to avoid it:** If you get dusted, leave the dust there ‚Äì it may be an indication that the duster already has some of your personal information and is trying to find what exchange you‚Äôre on so they can use what they have to get access to your account.

**Five dollar wrench attack**

**How it works:** The $5 wrench attack generally refers to any use physical violence or threats of violence to intimidate you into giving up your crypto or access to your accounts.

**How to avoid it:** Never disclose how much crypto you own to anyone, especially if   you live in a country or district with high crime. Never reveal your address,   phone number or email address.

&amp;#x200B;

#  General tips for keeping your crypto safe

¬∑ Never, ever, reveal your passwords or seed phrase to anyone.

¬∑ Never reveal any personal information to anyone online, other than the bare minimum that is needed for KYC purposes.

¬∑ Never tell anyone how much crypto you have, or that you‚Äôre into crypto.

¬∑ Use authenticator 2FA and whitelist for all exchanges. Keep your authenticator on a separate device.

¬∑ Split up seed phrases and store both halves in separate, secure locations; back them up and do the same with the backups.

¬∑ Google yourself and any handles you use online, make sure no personal information can be attained this way.

¬∑ Assume every person, app, website and browser extension is a scammer until proven otherwise.

¬∑ Always triple check crypto addresses and send a small test amount before sending a large amount.

¬∑ Research everything thoroughly."|0.89|40|0|40

I'd like to invite you all to CoinTracker's Crypto Tax AMA session: [tomorrow, 9/8 at 1 PM EDT/10 AM PDT.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cointracker/comments/x3aufq/crypto_tax_ama_featuring_shehan_cointrackers_head/)

Some of you may be asking ""Why now? The market sucks. The last thing I want to think about is taxes.""

**Exactly.** It's the last thing you want to think about when you're down on your initial investment.

But you *should*, because it's the perfect time to cut your tax bill and save big. It's called [tax-loss harvesting](https://www.cointracker.io/blog/the-2020-tax-loss-harvesting-guide), and the TL;DR is that selling coins at a loss = capital losses = counted directly against your capital gains, and counted against income if you only have net losses. Considering this, the final stretch of this calendar year may be the *ideal* time to think about taxes.

[Crypto Tax AMA](https://preview.redd.it/4w3yqffe8jm91.png?width=1201&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e478ec3fe5da924ff8f1aa5bbfa5cc9ff9a5f5e3)

Want to find out how this works and how to identify harvestable losses? Or perhaps you have questions about the [ETH merge](https://www.cointracker.io/blog/ethereum-2-tax-guide) and how the conversion of assets will impact taxes. From mining to staking rewards to anything else, feel free to ask!

While this session will be US-focused, CoinTracker also has support for the UK, Australia, India, and Canada. See you there!"|0.65|5|0|5

The idea being that this would emphasize the social aspects of trading, and people would have an incentive to put real effort into their art. 

You could use the site to promote your NFTs on other sites if you wanted to. The NFT Dollar Store would function more as a social site than an exchange. It gives you a way to communicate through art by haggling and trading in a low stakes way.

I work in US for government so I have a pension (eligible for retirement at 20 years, get 2% added towards pension for every year after service past 20 years-max of 72.5%) I also have a 457B plan (kind of like a 401K except we can take it out without penalty when we retire due to being public safety). We also have a DROP program (deferred retirement where we work 3 years past our actual retirement day and get our retirement out in an interest bearing account that yields 7.25% interest for the first 3 years and guaranteed 4% a year after that (must be withdrawn at age 70)

But while yes, opinions on this sub change with the wind, I find it hard to understand how everyone simply turned tail on Coinbase. Everyone used to say that CB were the thing. Everyone used CB and everyone was fine with CB. Maybe their services were a bit entry-level and simplified but everyone seemed satisfied with the service.

Now all of a sudden sentiment has changed. I can't even really point to a specific situation like card rewards slashing for CDC. But there is still decent support for CDC, like they are incompetent but they are still tolerable. But with CB it seemed like there was just a sudden turning of the tide, and everyone who felt so safe with CB now hated it. There was even some minor dissent against Kraken at that time and now everyone seems to love Kraken. Binance has also fallen slightly.

t3_x8k9kn|1662594058|CryptoCurrency|Giving up a bit of your humanity along with crypto?|"When Satoshi Nakamoto conceptualised Bitcoin, he had grandiose ideals: serve the marginalised and unbanked, level the playing field, empower the commoner so that we don‚Äôt get screwed by callous traditional financial institutions.

Not even two decades have lapsed since Bitcoin‚Äôs founding - and I‚Äôm sure you will agree with me that the crypto space must have evolved beyond Satoshi‚Äôs wildest dreams. It seems that developers apply laser focus on one aspect of the human experience and make profits out of it by monetising it with crypto. Axie Infinity, a play-to-earn app, is on the decline but it did take the world by storm as it legitimately provided people in developing countries a more lucrative source of income than their day jobs. With other play-to-earn apps like Splinterlands and and Gods Unchained continuing the momentum, it seems that play-to-earn apps are here to stay.

And that‚Äôs not all. Mention exercise and StepN comes to mind, enticing people to buy NFT sneakers at inflated prices because the potential payouts are even higher. SleeFi is a sleep-to-earn app built on Avalanche blockchain that is slated to be released this month. And of course, who can forget the pioneer of chat-to-earn apps, our beloved r/cryptocurrency? Incentivising us to post our comments with moons that have migrated to the mainnet. 

Almost everything can be monetised with crypto these days. You name it, there is a crypto earning opportunity for it. But in the midst of being glued to these apps and giving up our personal data and privacy in the process, are we losing ourselves bit by bit? Turning into mercenary money-making machines keen to optimise all our waking moments? Thinking ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about the money‚Äù and neglecting to just *be*.

Remain calm by remembering the most common advice in investing ‚Äúonly invest what you can afford to lose‚Äù let‚Äôs dig into what that means. If you lost your wallet would you be okay losing a mere $5-$10? What about $20-40 or even $100+ ? This is the number you want to figure out and use to invest. 

Let‚Äôs say you are comfortable losing $100 per week, that would be $400 per month. With this number you are comfortable losing; whenever a red day hits the stress won‚Äôt be as heavy. I like to think of red days as days i can buy more at a lowered price and get a better average.

If your goal is to make money within a week or two you‚Äôre just gambling and you should reevaluate your goals before investing more of your money. If your goal is to make money after 2+ years then be consistent with what you are comfortable losing and you‚Äôre most likely to be in profit depending on what you are investing in. 

I‚Äôm no professional so this is not financial advice but a way to help cope on red days going forward.

TL:DR ‚ÄúTo stay calm on red days figure out what you are okay with losing and don‚Äôt over invest. It is all numbers at the end of the day but the longer you are consistent with it the more likely you are to profit. Think of red days as days to accumulate at at a discount‚Äù"|0.57|5|0|5

t3_x8hj21|1662587178|CryptoCurrency|After the merge, where will the miners go?|"Once the merge completes, miners won't simply disappear. They will move to the next profitable coin.

What is the next profitable coin? It's anyone's guess but here are two of the main contenders that I could find:

1) Ravencoin (RVN)

Currently rank 89 on coinmarketcap, Ravencoin is a hot contender for post merge mining. Ravencoin is a peer-to-peer blockchain habdling transfer of assets from one party to another. It is very NFT focused. It has its own blockchain. 

In terms of mining, Ravencoin uses a new algorithm known as KAWPOW. It‚Äôs designed to be Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) resistant and is designed to be efficient on consumer GPU hardware.

Raven is easy to mine but one could argue that this could make ravencoin less valuable in future. Also we don't know how useful NFTs will be in the future.

2) Ergo

Ergo is rank 222 on coinmarketcap and is currently quite profitable to mine. It's currently less accessible than ravencoin, but it presents a solid choice for miners post merge.

Unlike Ravencoin, Ergo is more smart contract focused. As per their website ""Ergo is a next-generation smart contract platform that ensures the economic freedom of ordinary people through secure, accessible, and decentralized financial tools.""

Also like ravencoin, in terms if mining Ergo uses what it calls Autolkyos¬†which is a memory-hard ASIC-resistant Proof of Work algorithm oriented towards GPUs.

Also like ravencoin it is fairly easy to mine.

One could argue Ergo is less accessible and less user friendly than say Ravencoin, but it represents a solid choice.

While Ethereum NFTs have slowly been shrinking, Solana NFTs have seen massive growth during the Bear market. There has been a massive shift of Ethereum NFT users moving over to Solana this year. Many projects have blown up and seen massive ATHs. 



The top dog on Solana is Degods. An NFT project started towards the end of last year minting at 3 Sol. The floor price reached an ATH of just under 600 Sol recently with some NFTs selling for over $200,000. They've been building their own platform and expanding their brand constantly over the year to build to where they are at today. This surge in volume and price on Magic Eden is attributed to Degods new NFT launch called y00ts. a larger collection meant to expand their brand to a larger audience and more accessible. As it is working in gaining more holders, it is failing in the accessible part as currently the floor price for a y00t mint is at 150 Sol. 

Solana thrives on twitter and social media. No other chain of NFTs has the same activity as Solana does. It truly has a gigantic following that is spreading to tens of thousands of people during an extremely slow bear market. Just imagine how big it's going to get during the next bull."|0.35|0|0|0

Looking apart the good/bad debate, this is a milestone for Crypto.|"September 2021 was a very special month for Bitcoin and for all of Crypto.

If your hardware wallet is lost or damaged you can still recover your assets using your secret recovery phrase. You will need a new hardware wallet to access your assets. Unfortunately, if you lose your recovery phrase, there‚Äôs no way to recover your assets even with a new wallet.

t3_x8d4tt|1662576688|CryptoCurrency|Is the bottom in or not: An analysis of 9 bottom indicators|"**Intro**

One of the amazing parts of crypto is how much data we have that can inform our decisions. There are a lot of bottom indicators and many of these indicators have been shown to work rather well in the past. With the assumption that these indicators can offer some valuable information, what can we learn from them now?

**Importantly, we could debate whether or not these bottom indicators are useful or not, but that is not the goal of this post, so dont do that thanks.** This is just an attempt of creating an overview of what the bottom indicators say right now. Hence, if your idea is to say something along the lines of: *""I am going to post that technical analysis is useless and that the current macro economic environment means that technical analysis is out of the window and win those sweet, sweet moons!""* then please stay away. 

&amp;#x200B;

**(1) The rainbow chart - YES** 

Let's start with the goofy one. The rainbowchart uses a simple logarithmic growth curve to forecast the potential future price direction of Bitcoin. Currently, it is at the lowest level of ""Basically a Fire Sale"" and about to dip below. The only time this happened in the past was during the COVID Crash and that was an amazing buying opportunity. The fire sale level has always been a great opportunity too. 

So based on past experiences, there is a good chance the bottom is in. A critical caveat is that the top did not reach the red upper band this time, which is a sign of worry. The ""rainbow"" might be misaligned and need finetuning.

[Bitcoin Rainbow Chart](https://preview.redd.it/2j53rge28hm91.png?width=1123&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf41144edc707695938e65183e2e49096c218926)

&amp;#x200B;

**2.  Bitcoin 200 weekly moving average - MAYBE?**

The Bitcoin 200 weekly moving average is a moving average over, well, the past 200 weeks. It has been an amazing level of support and a clear bear market bottom indicator. We never spent long under this moving average. However, we have gone under it in June and failed to reclaim it, rejection off it even. So that is not a good look. 

Based on this indicator, one would expect this to be a good moment to buy, but the rejection is worrisome.

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC 200 weekly moving average](https://preview.redd.it/0qlqwsdt8hm91.png?width=1455&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3bc7dfb14122d9488188990120c0e916731111a)

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Total market cap 200 weekly moving average - YES** 

This is actually my favorite chart, because it is is often more predictive than looking at just Bitcoin. And given how big alts have become (more than 60% market cap), this makes sense. The downside is that this also has stablecoins in there, I believe. Again, we always held this 200 weekly MA level, and we are actually currently holding it still, retesting it for the second time. I would be worried if we dip below this one over a longer period, though. So far so good.

[Total market cap 200 weekly moving average](https://preview.redd.it/bz73po0e9hm91.png?width=1441&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a680e1cadb91d979474fb7628a5f35ba9acdd8e1)

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Pi cycle indicator - YES**

The Pi cycle indicator forecasts tops and bottoms for Bitcoin. It is based on two long-term moving averages: 471-day simple moving average and 150-day exponential moving average. The signal lights up when the latter falls below the former. Historically, it has been very effective in picking out cycle lows as you can see on the (blurry) chart, doing so successfully in 2015 and 2018. It flashed again this summer, suggesting the low is already in.

[Pi cycle bottom indicator](https://preview.redd.it/59iy1xw0bhm91.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc50610025ef271536059d8c3221d0b14284df9e)

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Hash ribbons indicator - YES**

The Bitcoin Hash Ribbon indicator tries to identify periods where Bitcoin miners are in distress and may be capitulating. The assumption is that such periods can occur when the price of $BTC is at major lows, and may therefore present a good opportunity to buy the dip. Two weeks ago, the bitcoin miner capitulation officially ended after 71 days. This capitulation zone was longer than 2021, and two days shorter than 2018's capitulation at $3.1k. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Hash ribbons indicator](https://preview.redd.it/k0o2uxogbhm91.png?width=1607&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a34b7696e56f1017dc47aa7b09a50b8c42c6b45)

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Puell Multiple indicator - YES**

The Puell Multiple is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of bitcoins (in USD) by the 365-day moving average of daily issuance value. This is rather technical, but importantly, the Puell Multiple uses the upper red band on the chart to show when miner revenues in USD terms are significantly higher than historical norms (in this case the 365-day moving average). So the Puell Multiple can be a useful Bitcoin forecasting tool to identify based on this metric whether price is too high and needs to drop (when the indicator is in the red zone), or whether it is too low and may need to bounce (indicator is in the green zone). Almost every time the red line reaches the green zone and leaves again, the bottom was in and we are due for a significant bounce. 

[Puell multiple indicator](https://preview.redd.it/b9eecgfobhm91.png?width=1171&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60d016bd61bc3cc5fe17788c63b2a021db1c60f5)

&amp;#x200B;

**7. MRV Z-score indicator - NO OR MAYBE?**

MVRV Z-Score is a bitcoin chart that uses blockchain analysis to identify periods where Bitcoin is extremely over or undervalued relative to its 'fair value'. It uses the market value (blue line), realised value (orange line) and z-score (red line). Specifically, The MVRV Z-score is a function of the difference between total market cap and realized market cap, divided by the standard deviation of the market cap. This shows by how many standards deviations the market value differs from the realized value. It evaluates if Bitcoin is over or under-evaluated compared to its ""normal"" value. 

Again, the green parts are always amazing buy opportunities but the price could still go down a bit from here based on previous data. We have not touched the lower band yet. 

[MRV Z-score indicator](https://preview.redd.it/7uefn5p7chm91.png?width=1141&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=263573d3657b6a5ffe826ad53336aabc58ecb250)

&amp;#x200B;

**8. 85% drawdown from all time high - NO**

A key aspect of every bear market so far is that we go down at least 85% from the all time high. In 2015, we dropped about 87% and in 2018 we dropped about 85%. Currently, we are down about 75%. Based on this indicator, we have some way to go, and this is why many people expect $10k. That said, we also did not rise as much from the bottom as in previous cycles, so it is unclear whether the drop should be as steep as before. Note, however, that *everytime* before during the bear when we dropped 70-70%, a 100% rally happened before further drawdown. So even based on previous bears, we should expect a bounce. 

&amp;#x200B;

**9. Weekly RSI - YES**

The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price of that security. Based on the weekly RSI, we are at very undervalued conditions. Weekly RSI was even the lowest it has ever been, and this is also true for the monthly RSI. Everytime we hit the oversold values (under the purple highlighted area), bitcoin bottomed. We just went there again.

[BTC weekly RSI](https://preview.redd.it/pso0od61fhm91.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd278e1b3422b8e392ba05c6eda4347f375a2db7)

**Conclusion**

All-in-all, the 9 indicators do not agree on whether the bottom is in or whether more pain might follow, but definitely suggest that this is an awesome level to buy, for what that is worth, because the macro economy is terrifying and this might be the first recession crypto experiences. That bottom indicators are flashing should not be a surprise to anyone given how hard and fast we dropped. Personally, this is where I am DCAing as these are the prices I had hoped for a long time ago. I might be wrong and that is when I will buy more. 

I likely missed some bottom indicators though. What else is out there and what do these indicators say?"|0.9|412|0|412

A recent **Trail of Bits** research report examines the unintended centralities in blockchains.

Some of the Key Findings and Takeaways mentioned in the reports are - 

 ‚óè Every blockchain has a privileged set of entities that can **modify the semantics** of the blockchain to potentially change past transactions. 

‚óè The number of entities sufficient to **disrupt a blockchain** is relatively low: **four** for Bitcoin, **two** for Ethereum, and less than **a dozen** for most PoS networks. 

‚óè The **vast majority of Bitcoin nodes appear to not participate in mining** and node operators face no explicit penalty for dishonesty. 

‚óè For a blockchain to be optimally distributed, there must be a so-called **Sybil cost.** There is currently no known way to implement Sybil costs in a permissionless blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum without employing a centralized trusted third party (TTP). Until a mechanism for enforcing Sybil costs without a TTP is discovered, it will be almost impossible for permissionless blockchains to achieve satisfactory decentralization.

‚óè **Bitcoin traffic is unencrypted**‚Äîany third party on the network route between nodes (e.g., ISPs, Wi-Fi access point operators, or governments) can observe and choose to drop any messages they wish. 

‚óè Of all Bitcoin traffic, **60% traverses just three** **ISPs.** 

‚óè **Tor is now the largest network provider in Bitcoin**, routing traffic for about half of Bitcoin‚Äôs nodes. **Half** of these nodes are routed through the Tor network, and the other half are reachable through .onion addresses. The next largest autonomous system (AS)‚Äîor network provider‚Äîis **AS24940** from Germany, constituting only **10% of nodes**. A malicious Tor exit node can modify or drop traffic similarly to an ISP. 

‚óè Of Bitcoin‚Äôs nodes, 21% were running an **old version** of the Bitcoin Core client that is known to be **vulnerable** in June of 2021. 

‚óè The **Ethereum** ecosystem has a **significant amount of code reuse**: 90% of recently deployed Ethereum smart contracts are at least 56% similar to each other.

It also a period of time where there are lots of innovations either being released or being build, but they usually stay under the radar and don‚Äôt go mainstream (like in bull market times). For example: Ethereum merge (during a bull market this event would be hyped to the max in main stream media).

How to survive?
As a long term crypto investor I‚Äôve been through multiple bear and bull markets already.

Last crypto winter was brutal and long. Crypto prices took years to recover or even show signs of improvement.
The community was kinda dead and barely alive. 

Most of my friends sold their crypto practically at bottom prices cause they wanted to ‚Äòget some money back‚Äô.

What did I do?

1. I stopped checking prices, maybe once a month i remembered I had some crypto and checked to see how bad it was.

If you forget about it for a while it doesn‚Äôt hurt and you will not be so negatively influenced all the time.

2. I have always considered my crypto invested money as gone. That made it so much easier to survive winter. I always pretend in my head that I will loose it all and prices will eventually go to 0.
That way I‚Äôm not tempted to sell.

3. Read about innovations, tech stuff, blockchain stuff. Real world adoption etc. 
It‚Äôs more fundamental, you‚Äôll get a better understanding of the ideas and possibilities of the underlying technology.
Do Not read about prices, predictions and specific currencies/tokens. It‚Äôs all bs, no one can tell the future.

4. Have some faith. Just trust that these cycles are normal. We are only at the beginning of the potential crypto has in our world.

Last but not least: 
Don‚Äôt ever think you or someone knows when we have reached market bottom. It can always get worse.
So if you think we‚Äôve reached bottom in this current market, start reading this piece of text againüòâ

And the sun will always start shining again when you least expect it‚òÄÔ∏è

Happy winter guys!

Edit: I see a lot of comments that I forget ‚Äòbuying more‚Äô. But that‚Äôs not what I did because it contradicts with ‚Äòforgetting about crypto‚Äô. You‚Äôll only stress yourself more, especially when prices fall deeper you‚Äôll be tempted to sell to reduce your loss."|0.81|83|0|83

t3_x86xan|1662561752|CryptoCurrency|People need to accept the harsh reality that crypto isn‚Äôt likely to be pumping anytime soon, and it‚Äôs because of interest rate hikes across the world.|"The world isn‚Äôt exactly in great shape. Inflation has been soaring across the globe, and to combat it governments have increased interest rates. Over 45 countries are doing it, to be precise. 

In environments where rates are low and money flows, it‚Äôs often called *loose monetary policy*. And in economic climates where rates are raised, we call in *tightening*. 

When we are loosey goosey with rates, investments tend to do well because capital flows more freely as loans and collateral are easier to afford. 

When rates get tight and start to bite, it‚Äôs harder to spend as freely and borrowing becomes harder. Basically, there‚Äôs less money and less volume in markets. 

Right now, countries across the world are furiously raising interest rates to combat inflation. It‚Äôs one of the swiftest money tightening cycles ever, and throw in some war and post pandemic recovery, and things look dicey to say the least. 

Crypto is awesome, I love it, we all do! But it‚Äôs not exactly a blue chip stock, it‚Äôs a speculative asset, and the risk of that makes it a *no no* in a world where we are **tightening** our belts and being wary of rate rises. 

Eventually, we will get things under control and rates will be eased and lowered. When this happens, governments, businesses, and people who tightened their purses during rate rises find opportunities and optimism to spend their money again - much of that money finds its way into the market, and to crypto. 

I have no doubt the next bull run will be epic. However, I think you are very optimistic to think it will happen in the midst of such a historic monetary tightening environment. 

Naturally, I could be very wrong. But the obscure technical analysis appearing lately to provide hopium hasn‚Äôt convinced me otherwise yet. 

TL:DR - Interest rates are climbing across the world, which is bad for investments and will inhibit the potential for a new crypto bull run. When looser monetary policy begins the bulls will rise once more, but not a moment before."|0.71|66|0|66
t3_x86vq4|1662561643|CryptoCurrency|State of Vermont alleges Celsius is a fraudulent ponzi operation, and Celsius was in losses in 2021 itself. 40 states are investigating Celsius|"The latest joinder just entered in the Celsius bankruptcy filing by Vermont state's Department of Financial Regulation alleges severe irregularities and fraud at Celsius. 

Apparently, 40 states are investigating Celsius for fraud and illegal securities offerings. They accuse Mashinsky of lying to investors in AMAs. 

Celsius bankruptcy started in 2020 and 2021, and not in 2022 Summer, as Celsius have been claiming. 


&gt; During the course of the multistate investigation, it has become clear that Celsius, through its CEO Alex Mashinsky and otherwise, made false and misleading claims to investors about, inter alia, the company‚Äôs financial health and its compliance with securities laws, both of which likely induced retail investors to invest in Celsius or to leave their investments in Celsius despite concerns about the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. 

&gt; In fact, preliminary analysis of financial records provided to the multistate regulators group indicates that Celsius experienced massive losses in the first seven months of 2021. It also experienced two material adverse events in June and July of 2021

&gt; During the 341 meeting, **Celsius admitted, through its CFO Chris Ferraro, that the
company‚Äôs insolvency started with financial losses in 2020 and through 2021**, belying the claims in Celsius‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst Day‚Äù declarations that the company‚Äôs insolvency stemmed from the fall of the crypto market during Spring 2022 and the related ‚Äúrun on the bank,‚Äù and further demonstrating the falsity of Celsius‚Äôs representations to investors



Apparently Celsius itself admitted its earnings were not enough to cover the yields being paid out, thus old investors were being paid with funds funnelled from new investors i.e. a ponzi scheme

&gt; Celsius also admitted at the 341 meeting that the company had never earned enough revenue to support the yields being paid to investors. This shows a high level of financial mismanagement and **also suggests that at least at some points in time, yields to existing investors were probably being paid with the assets of new investors.**

State regulators say there are credible claims that Celsius manipuolated the price of CEL token:

&gt; Credible claims have been asserted publicly, through letters to this Court and otherwise, that Celsius and its management engaged in the improper manipulation of the price of the CEL token

And coincidentally it‚Äôs the exact same date that releases CPI numbers, an indicator that is the reason for recent sell offs. Pretty much all investors and institutions are interested in that number.

Looking at the past performance CPI date releases ALWAYS shakes up the stock and crypto markets. 

[last CPI release BTC pumped +3.72% &amp; ETH +6.82%](https://imgur.com/a/EOuYmn9) **within a hour**

The month before that release [BTC dropped -3.43%](https://imgur.com/a/htQuFJD) within a hour just to recover and actually pump way higher hours after. 

So for those of you who think ‚Äúthe merge won‚Äôt do anything to the price‚Äù it‚Äôs almost guaranteed that these days will have high volatility. I‚Äôm personally really hyped to trade but also hope to catch some really cheap ETH in case it dumps heavily.

If CPI numbers turn out better then expected there is a chance we‚Äôll see a crazy pump. FOMO will kick in and institutions will throw a lot of money into crypto when stock markets are recovering similar to the July rally.

On the other hand if CPI numbers turn out worse then expected you can almost guaranteed expect a dump in the stock market. Crypto usually does crypto things and might depeg and go it‚Äôs own way but most likely it‚Äôll dump as well.

I trade myself every day and I highly recommend to stay away from high leverage if not any leverage at all. Yesterday was proof how quickly crypto can move. -2% in a single minute combined with leverage can easily trigger a lot of stop losses.

TL;DR: Get ready for a rollercoaster. Only a week left.

t3_x84ndd|1662555917|CryptoCurrency|ENS domain name sales SPIKE ahead of the Merge|"# In preparation for the upcoming Merge, ENS related trading is going on a 7-day peak by volume on OpenSea!

In case you didn't know, Ethereum Name Service (**ENS**) domains are a distributed, open, and expandable naming system on the Ethereum blockchain that basically let's you syphon in several wallet adresses into a single ENS name, such as *vitalik.eth* (I'm pretty sure you recognice that name from crypto scams on twitter lmao).

Since users only need to share their domain name, very much like with any other regular address, it is a hell of a lot simpler than copy/pasting and double-checking a 42 character long adress. Since they're minted as NFTs, these domain names can be purchased, sold, and exchanged between users.

OpenSea numbers reveal that an ENS domain typically costs 0.3207 ETH, or $533.71. Recently, the weekly volume of Ethereum domain NFTs has exceeded 2,249 ETH, surpassing that of *RTFKT Clone X* (1,992 ETH) and *Bored Ape Yacht Club* (1,777 ETH), the two top NFT collections.

The average price of ENS pamped 167% to 0.3895 ETH, or $641 USD as a byproduct of the surge in trading activity; meanwhile their daily trading volume went up from 120.7 ETH up to 1044.6 ETH.

This all happens about a week before the prophezised Ethereum Merge, which is pretty much gonna go down between the 13th and 15th.

More than 508,000 users currently possess more than 2 million ENS products on OpenSea, with 2,682 ENS domains having been sold overall.

# The Most Expensive Ethereum Domain Names

The most expensive ENS domain names are **000.eth**, purchased for 300 ETH, currently being sold for 5,000 ETH, followed by **opensea.eth**, **crypto.eth**, **google.eth**, and **nike.eth**.

September‚Äôs promising start comes after an exceptional month of sales for ENS in August, which saw more than 300,000 new ‚Äú*.eth*‚Äù registrations, and a monthly revenue of around 2,744 ETH, **pretty much the third-highest month since ENS‚Äôs founding in 2018**.

On the Flipside, NFT Trading Volume Drops to yearly lows on OpenSea.

**OpenSea also commented it will fully support PoS after the merge, but not PoW forks if any.**

&amp;#x200B;

So what's it gonna be boys? Do you have an ENS domain like the madlad vitalik? Would ya'll be interested in copping one? IMO out of all the """"""""""""usecases"""""""""" NFT have nowadays this is the most compelling and useful one."|0.36|0|0|0
t3_x84vu6|1662556553|CryptoCurrency|Will there be another BTC or ETH?|"So Bitcoin has created in 2009. Ethereum development and premine began in 2014 and was released the following year in 2015. It's been 7 years and there's no sign of a third major cryptocurrency. Which got me thinking, will there ever be one?

A lot of coins claiming to be superior to Bitcoin have died out and currently, we have Binance Smart Chain, Cardano and Solana claiming to be superior to Ethereum. They are likely to stay relevant whilst Ethereum gas fees remain high (although they're low during this bear market) but I struggle to think if that'll continue after the sharding upgrade (which is admittedly over 12 months away).

Bitcoin and Ethereum prioritise security, and a lot of their value comes from their age. It's very difficult to be truly decentralized which is partly why Ethereum used Proof of Work for 7 years before transitioning to Proof of Stake. How likely is it for a new decentralized cryptocurrency to arise when it needs years of blockchain history to become established? And what niche will it fill?

Bitcoin is like digital gold and Ethereum is like 'monetized code.' This means that useful applications of blockchain are likely to be written on Ethereum, and thus be smaller in market cap. My question is whether there's space for something else as conceptually large as Bitcoin and Ethereum as they seem to be covering almost all use cases of a decentralized blockchain.

The closest I can think of is Monero, since it has a long history and is decentralized. There is a market for default privacy but as seen from their market cap rank, it's not as 'profound' as the top 2."|0.4|0|0|0
t3_x84tha|1662556373|CryptoCurrency|Time for some hopium|"
I‚Äôve seen a lot of people talk lately how things look bad and the anti crypto wave is hitting this sub again calling for 15k or 10k BTC.
 
So let me offer you a nice dose of hopium!

First of all **Fundamentals have not changed**

In fact nothing big has changed in crypto lately that would cause a bigger dip. No new laws banning it &amp; no regulation causing trouble.

**Analysis**

I‚Äôve made a post before [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/x4slwi/btc_weak_at_20000_what_are_your_thoughts_analysis/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) analyzing the most important recent indicators. Since the stock market hasn‚Äôt done well so far this week BTC again rejected the EMA-9 as you can see [here](https://imgur.com/a/HW2nl3x)

But what caused the dump? What horrible news could‚Äôve lead to the current situation? 

If you paid attention to the price movement and check the biggest exchange binance you can see the majority actually happened **in a single minute** [1m dump](https://imgur.com/a/DkEAUmE)

Usually such dump happens with sudden news like CPI numbers but it happened quite randomly. Tons of long positions got rekt, panic selling starts, short positions open causing this to dump further.

On the bright side it‚Äôs nothing like the June dip. If you compare both sell offs this one was very sudden ( as mentioned above in a single minute ) while the June dip towards 17600$ was a couple days long bleeding and dumping. BTC is holding the 18500$ range very well so far and started crabbing again.

It wouldn‚Äôt even surprise me if there will be a recovery to **19k TODAY** when stock markets don‚Äôt dump and people realize it was just one big panic sell off. I would even bet on 20-21k if futures and markets are green !

 Additionally we have the merge incoming. No matter the price movement on the day or after if everything goes well this is one of the most important events in crypto and could be a great fundamental for the next bullrun."|0.48|0|0|0

Anyway, posting a couple of questions seems to have gotten me shadowbanned from the sub.  Stay Classy r/Terraluna!

After reviewing the Discord and Github I have questions....

So I've been reviewing the Terra Rebels Discord and the [Github](https://github.com/terra-money) and from what I can see there is no certainty that TFL will conduct the merge from the Pull Request (PR) - (I.e. make the parameter changes to increase the tax rate). So is this all just hype? Or is there actual confirmation that TFL will perform the merge?

Evidence - Terra Rebels Discord Server - read through the dev channels, while there seems to be some communication between DK and Vegas, and possibly communication between other developers and developers at TFL (based on second hand comments within the channel, so hard to actually confirm) there isn't direct confirmation that as of a specific date the PR for the parameter changes associated with [Proposal 46319](https://classic-agora.terra.money/t/proposal-for-the-1-2-tax-parameter-change/46319) will be merged.

Looking at github itself for the PR while there is a comment from simcheolhwan, who appears to be with TFL, for[PR#101](https://github.com/terra-money/station/pull/101) there isn't any indication that the PR would be merged. Additionally looking at [PR#102](https://github.com/terra-money/classic-mainnet/pull/102) jamesbsbs asks octalmage, who also appears to be with TFL, if PR for working code to change the tax rate is submitted if it would be merged, and never got confirmation that it would.

On a positive note, I do see commits that Terra Rebels have submitted to fix a bug being recently merged, namely [PR#98](https://github.com/terra-money/station/pull/98) which was committed by edk208 and commented on by vegasmorph and GODoal who have been active on Terra Rebels, and the merge request was committed by simcheolhwan.

So my question - is the LUNC community pinning their hope that [the proposal](https://medium.com/@edwardkim.ek/a-path-to-recovery-for-luna-classic-e7ff076b28ab) put forward by edk208 will be merged based entirely upon the hype that a single bug fix was successfully merged? Don't get me wrong, I love the proposal, and am hopeful that the LUNC community can pull the ecosystem back to relevance, but I'm looking for solid evidence that this will happen and I'm not seeing it. So is this all just speculation?

Market is crashing, You are bleeding heavy losses and in the middle of all that people are shouting ""hodl"". And yes, Sometimes ""HODL crowd"" are the most annoying thing about crypto winter. 






















But annoying or not, there is a believe that hodling is the best thing you can do during a crypto winter or market crash. After all your other choice is to sell at a loss. And selling at loss is a bad thing right? Wrong! It might be the smartest thing to do!




















Let me explain the logic behind ""HODL"" mentality.
Where the hold logic is coming from?
It is the direct result of presumption that every dive will eventually end.
Meaning that if you keep an asset long enough it will go up again at some point in the future. 






















Sadly this presumption is false. A nosediving asset can do three thing: Go up, down or experience a period of relative price stability. And this is always true. An asset can keep going down more and more until it is practically worthless. 
You can speculate using fundamental or historical data about where an asset might move next. But you can't be certain. For all we know a nosedive might be followed by a bigger one. 





















This means that holding an asset is not necessarily a wise choice. It is only a smart choice if said asset is ""much more likely"" to regain its value. Like a very big and well known company dealing with a short period of uncertainty. For example a car manufacturer having to deal with a technical malfunction in one of its models. Usually the said model would be recalled and fixed and nosediving shares would go up again. 































The difference here is:


1.crypto projects are mostly new and with much less backbone than big corporations.

2.their main source for generating value is usually through investments and not production. 

3. Their price is more speculative.

And finally

4. They don't have the support of government. 


So a nosediving coin/token might go into doom spiral much more easily. 





























Now what I am not saying you should sell with the first sign of crash. But to consider it as a completely reasonable choice. Holding your coin is also a totally valid option. But should not be treated as the default best!




















If your asset/coin keeps going down your hold strategy will just make your losses worst. Don't judge people for trying to stop-loss. We don't know where is the bottom. We don't know if crypto ever gonna see its ATH. 
And frankly calling other people paper-hand for trying to do something that might end up smarter than our own choice is just plain stupid."|0.48|0|0|0

If I say ‚Äúincluded on ITAD‚Äù it means the site was listed on the IsThereAnyDeals site which means it's most likely 100% legit and safe (Though some not on ITAD still are legit). I also found sites from general research and from digging through the AllKeyShop site, which is similar to ITAD, but includes most key sites, legit or not.

**Here's the list (in no particular order) (Links at the bottom):** 

&amp;#x200B;

* **2Game** : accepts BTC, ETH, DOGE, LTC, BCH, through Coinbase Commerce. Not the best prices, but definitely has some discounted ones. Legit key reseller, and is included on ITAD. Doesn't seem to have all games, but has a good amount. Registration / Log-in required for purchases.

&amp;#x200B;

* **GameBillet** : accepts BTC, ETH, USDC, DOGE, BCH, through Coinbase Commerce. Not the best prices, but does have discounts, and I have successfully bought a DLC from them before. Legit reseller and is included on ITAD. Seems to have a good collection of games, surely not all, though. Registration / Log-in required for purchases.

&amp;#x200B;

* **IndieGala** : accepts BTC, ETH, DOGE, LTC, BCH, through Coinbase Commerce. Normal prices, but has a lot of free extra items to earn and a lot of giveaways to enter, And other activities no other key site has. And you probably could still find a bunch of good deals occasionally. I have bought 3 games from here before, and have gotten a gift game key. Legit reseller, which is included on ITAD. Seems to have a lot of games, probably not all though. No Registration / Log-in required for purchases.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Kinguin** : Accepts ETH, LTC, XRP, transactions happen on their site via BitBay. Kinguin is a site where multiple sellers can list their keys, so when you choose a game, you may find that you'll be able to choose from different sellers. Problem is, some of these sellers may be selling gray market keys, which are keys not legitimately acquired from the original seller. So use at your own risk, maybe do some research about the seller you pick for a key. I bought two games with it a while ago, and it worked with no issues. The site itself is a little fishy, sometimes I have seen listings like ‚ÄúGTA 6‚Äù, but as I said it has worked for me, there's a very low chance it won‚Äôt for you. The sellers on this site usually offer really competitive prices (for example, the same game going for \~$50 on other sites was going for \~$4 on this site, although this also goes for most of the sites listed next). And they seem to have nearly all games. This site is not included on ITAD. If I recall correctly, Registration / Log-in is required for purchases.

&amp;#x200B;

* **G2A** : Accepts BTC, Transaction happens on their site via BitBay. G2A is similar to Kinguin in the way games are sold. I have used it to buy a few games and a steam wallet code a while ago, and it worked well with no issues. Same as Kinguin, sellers here provide very competitive prices too. The site also offers a subscription that will let you buy games cheaper. They also seem to have pretty much nearly every game. Don‚Äôt use their G2A Wallet feature, I think they take money back from it after inactivity for a while. This site is also not included on ITAD. Log-in / Registration is required for purchases.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Keys4Coins** : Accepts BTC, DOGE, LTC, XMR, DASH, VTC, BCH, ETH. Transactions happen on their site, not sure through what method. This is one of the sites that are crypto payment exclusive. I have used it once, and it worked fine, they deliver the key to your email. I have sometimes seen two results of the same game, so I'm not sure if they sell the keys themselves or rely on sellers the same way Kinguin and G2A do. They say they bought the keys from major distributors. The site seems to have a good collection of games. You enter your email as you check out, so the key is delivered there. It is not included on ITAD. Every time I try to log in, it gives me an ‚Äúaccess denied‚Äù error, but Registration / Log-in is optional anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

* **JoltFun** : Accepts BTC, BTC Lightning. Transactions happen on their site on ‚ÄúBitPay Servers‚Äù. Another crypto payment exclusive site. This site has good, competitive prices most of the time. They say their keys are from legit sellers and developers, and that they do not condone gray market fraudulent keys. Though sometimes I see the same game listed twice, I'm not sure why that is. They seem to have a good collection of games, too. Keys are delivered to your email. The site is not included on ITAD. No option to Register / Log-in, Purchases sent directly to your email.

&amp;#x200B;

* **CDKeys** : Accepts BTC for small payments, Also accepts AAVE, ADA, BCH, BNB, BSV, DOT, ETC, ETH, LINK, LTC, MATIC, NANO, OMG, PAX, QTUM, SOL, TRX, TUSD, USDC, USDT, VGX, XLM. Transactions happen via Coinify. This site too offers some good prices and has a big collection of games. Not sure if they sell any gray market keys, but I do not think so. I bought a game with it and it worked. This site is not included on ITAD. Registration / Log-in is required for purchases.

&amp;#x200B;

* **HRKGame** : Accepts BTC, BCH, DOGE, ETH, LTC, USDC, DAI, through Coinbase Commerce, or using the ZEN payment method which uses BitBay. Has some of the best prices out of the sites listed here, I've already used it to buy 5 keys. When I did, I did not receive my keys, but support solved my issue in a few minutes, not sure if that was related to the crypto payment method or just a site wide bug I got. They say they are an authorized game reseller, and they get the keys from publishers, game devs, and licensed distributors. They have a collection of games that grows and shrinks (saw that some games available before no longer are at the time of writing this) which might be just because the games go out and in of stock. This site is not included on ITAD. Registration / Log-in required.

&amp;#x200B;

*  **Gamivo** : Accepts BTC, BCH, ETH, through Zonda Pay. Seems to have some fairly competitive prices. It uses the same method of relying on sellers as seen on G2A, and Kinguin. They have a subscription service for cheaper purchases. One time I did not see the Zonda payment method, but re-adding the item to the cart fixed it, not sure what that was about. It's not included on ITAD. Account registration / Log-in is required.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Gamers-Outlet** : Accepts BTC through Triple-A method. Fairly good prices. They claim their keys are from legit EU distributors and scanned from the original game boxes. They seem to have a good collection of games with multiple platforms included. Not included on ITAD, and required Registration / Log-in.

&amp;#x200B;

*  **MMOGA** : Accepts BTC, ETH, USDC, DOGE, LTC, DAI, BCH. Happens through Coinbase Commerce. They seem to have nice prices. It seems like they rely on sellers the same way G2A and the likes of that do, though it doesn't seem you can pick the seller yourself. The site seems to have a good amount of games. Again, this too is not Included on ITAD. Pretty sure Registration / Log-in was needed.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Play-Asia** : Accepts BTC, BCH, ETH, XRP, Through Bitpay, which on this site allows you to choose from any wallet or crypto transaction sites. And seem to have averagely good prices. It seems like they don't only sell games, but other products as well. Despite the name, Digital goods should still work outside of Asia. Not sure how they obtain their keys, as they do not mention it. Not included on ITAD. And requires Registration / Log-in.

&amp;#x200B;

*  **CJS-CDKeys** : Accepts BTC Through Bitpay. You can select another transaction type called CoinPayments which apparently supports a bunch more coins, but it didn't work in my region. They seem to have normal prices from what I've seen. They say their keys are ‚Äúgenuine‚Äù with not much more info provided. It seems like they rely on some third party key stock called AutoKey for most of their products, which I'm not sure if it is the stock provider itself, or just some key storage service they use. It's not included on ITAD. You can check out as a guest without Registration / Log-in, but Bitpay itself asks you for Registration on their site before you pay.

This is the updated list of all the game key seller sites that accept crypto payment. If I missed any site or detail, please tell me, and I'll edit the post to add / fix it. 

I think I found all the sites now, but there always could be more that I still yet to know of.

Thank you for reading.

Turns out that it was a misconception and that I was living in a self-imposed bubble. Earlier today, I responded to Kraken personnel‚Äôs message here and asked when Kraken would be coming to my home country. To my amazement, my message was responded to within 10 minutes. Turns out that Singaporeans could access to most of Kraken‚Äôs services! Clients living in Singapore cannot use off-chain staking. Also, futures trading is restricted. 

This got me all excited and led me to DYOD about Kraken. Here‚Äôs what I found out:

Pros 

1. Prompt customer service. Representatives swiftly respond to Redditors‚Äô comments on this sub, which makes perfect sense because you should be where your customers are.

2. Transparent and audited proof of reserves. They have evidence that they have all user deposits for various coins like BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, XRP, ADA and DOT in their custody.

3. Monthly holding reports they distribute to customers with staked assets offer additional peace of mind.

4. Reliable exchange. www.withdrawalfees.com show that the withdrawal fees are pretty competitive compared to other exchanges.

5. Supports Monero, if you want to live by the principles of crypto and use it anonymously. Transferring Monero requires you to obtain a private TXID, something that Kraken personnel provide promptly.

6. Live price feeds available on their trading platform UI, which helps you to make the best informed decision.

7. Has a social conscience. Reportedly gave every Ukrainian citizen who opened an account with it before March 9, 2022 $1000 worth of Bitcoin.

8. CEO of Kraken has gained kudos from netizens by advising people to keep their coins off centralised exchanges because a day may come where the police demands Kraken to freeze all its users‚Äô assets without judicial consent.

Cons

1. Recurring buys are not automated as yet. You have to create an API-Key within your account and incorporate python script in order to set up recurring buys yourself.

2. Trading platform can be made more comprehensive. Features like ‚Äúorder triggers order‚Äù and ‚Äúorder cancels order‚Äù could make trading more intuitive for inexperienced traders.

3. No instant free ACH deposits.

4. Depositing fiat incurs more fees compared to doing so for other exchanges because you can currently onboard fiat through wire transfers.

5. Do not support the Binance Chain (BNB) or the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) (BEP20/BEP2 Tokens), which may limit opportunities for some investors."|0.59|3|0|3

It uses a simple logarithmic growth curve to forecast the potential future price direction of Bitcoin. It was made in 2014. The chart looks like this:

https://preview.redd.it/9zvx42dpdem91.png?width=2107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c67ead44cc6f8bac06b0c15afa5144cda28d7c27

Although it is clearly stated that this chart is just for educational and entertainment purposes and does not provide any financial advice -which I would wholeheartedly agree with- it is interesting that this chart has been rather accurate at identifying good moments to sell and good moments to buy. One time in 2014 we went above the chart. Now we are about to dip below it:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ejwc6jiqdem91.png?width=306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3ae5e346af4c8a3458e499011a24c3df826ea2e

Dipping below the ""basically a fire sale"" level has only happened once before, during the March 2020 Covid crash. It was the most amazing buy opportunity and anyone who bought BTC back then is still up a lot.

**Questions:**

* **Should we attribute any meaning to this chart?** It is definitely recommending us to buy, which aligns with almost all the bottom indicators flashing (e.g. Pi cycle indicator, Puell Multiple, MRV-Z score, RSI and MACD lowest ever). That said, there is no doubt that crypto has not seen a macro environment like this one before.
* **What shall we name the level under the ""this is a fire sale"" level?** Perhaps ""Sell your family, friends, and kidney"" level? Or might it be the ""Crypto is dead"" level?"|0.87|449|0|449
t3_x7zmbb|1662539203|CryptoCurrency|Lady of Crypto starting her own trading firm - Don't fall for this scam (Part 2)|"2 days ago I opened this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/x5xz8o/lady\_of\_crypto\_starting\_her\_own\_trading\_firm\_dont/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/x5xz8o/lady_of_crypto_starting_her_own_trading_firm_dont/)

That day also marked one of the rare days where I was really proud of CT. Lady of Crypto got so much well deserved backlash, she decided to postpone the announcement about her prop trading firm so she can ""implement some changes"". This thread I linked above was posted as a screenshot in her comments by few people so I like to believe we deserve some of the credit as well.

She should be dropping an announcement today, so ahead of that, I did a little bit of research so I can help even more people to understand why online prop trading firms like hers are essentially a scam, especially in the crypto space.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, how does Lady of Crypto's online prop trading firm work?**

She promises to give you her own capital to trade with. What you have to do is pay for an entrance fee and pass the test. It may sound good on paper, but, in reality, this is far from a fair deal. She's also claiming that she's using these entrance fees only for customer support and backend development. This is very misleading because these entrance fees are her entire business model. To understand this better let's compare it to an example of one of the biggest online prop trading services in TradeFi. In the screenshot below you can see how their evaluation phase looks like.

[https://paste.pics/360e1e19cc4434f0daf7057cbc82d9aa](https://paste.pics/360e1e19cc4434f0daf7057cbc82d9aa)

When compared to the example above, Lady of Crypto's evaluation phase is much harder, because you need to hit 10% profit targets in both phases and you have 10% overall drawdown.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, let's pull some stats from this online prop trading service for October and November 2021:**

October:

New live accounts: 3544

Passed phase one: 18%

Passed phase two: 31% of traders who passed phase one

Reached first profit split: 4% of traders who passed phase two.

**So 2/1000 of new live accounts reached first profit split (0.2%).**

&amp;#x200B;

November:

New live accounts: 5718

Passed phase one: 10%

Passed phase two: 24% of traders who passed phase one

Reached first profit split: 3% of traders who passed phase two

**So 7/1000 of new live accounts reached first profit split (0.7%).**

&amp;#x200B;

The statistics look pretty interesting. We can say that relatively decent amount of people passed the evaluation phase (remember that Lady's evaluation is harder than theirs). But, once traders started trading with live funds, only few of them ended up being profitable. Why did this happen? The most logical explanation is that traders, once they get capital to trade with, tend to risk big in hopes they'll catch a big break. Of course, in the big majority of cases this strategy backfires.

So, is Lady of Crypto aware of these things? Absolutely. That's why her claims that she's giving her own funds to traders are absolutely false. It would just be too risky. That's why the traders that successfully pass the evaluation phase will keep on trading on demo accounts while being under the impression that they are trading with live funds. This way her risk is reduced to almost nothing. Also, there's no way for traders to check if they are actually trading with live funds.

I'd like to add that people who think there's nothing wrong with business models like these tend to say that nobody forces people to get involved with them. Personally, I don't think this kind of argument is valid. Nobody forces people to get involved in any of the scams that happen in  the crypto space on daily basis, yet it doesn't mean we should pretend that they are not happening. Crypto should be about the community, and it's up to us to educate others and help them realize what's truly happening.

One last thing: once Lady of Crypto drops her announcement today, I'd really appreciate if all of you could comment on it so we can spread awareness and hopefully help some gullible people to avoid losing money.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Online prop trading firms are nothing but legal scams that are marketed towards new and unsuccessful traders. Their business model relies on entrance fees and an extremely low success rate.  Lady of Crypto is dishonest about the way her business model works and she tries to convince people that she's using entrance fees only to cover customer support and backend development costs but that is far from the truth."|0.87|49|0|49

t3_x7yeqz|1662534638|CryptoCurrency|Bitcoin became legal tender a year ago in El Salvador, and this didn't go well|"In September 2021 El Salvador become the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. President Nayib Bukele also spent over $420 million dollars of public money to buy Bitcoin as an investment, and build the necessary infrastructure for the Chivo Wallet, a state custodial wallet. Since then, Bitcoin adoption has been negligible, their sovereign Bitcoin holdings have declined in value by over 58%. Salvadoran bonds are trading for pennies on the dollar, and the economy is on the brink of an economic catastrophe. In addition to that, crypto remittances represent only a 2% of all remittances, which is a failure because Nayib Bukele expected to be 20% by September 2022.

What happened to El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment and why was it such a failure? What happened to the Volcano Bonds? What about Bitcoin City?¬†

Even though 90% of businesses across the country accept Bitcoin, almost no one uses it. The government of El Salvador tried to increase adoption by offering a $30 dollars airdrop and Chivo Wallet discounts at gas stations. However, none of that worked since salvadorans prefer using FIAT for their daily economic activities. Nayib Bukele promised to install over 1,000 Bitcoin ATMs, however due to legal ongoing issues with Athena only 200 ATMs were installed. Early this year, AlphaPoint fixed the majority of Chivo Wallet issues but it was too little too late. People were losing thousands of dollars because of missing transactions on the Chivo Wallet, and sometimes the Bitcoin ATMs were low on cash which represented a problem for people who were trying to withdrawn remittances sent from abroad.

Back in November 2021, Bukele promised to release the Volcano Bonds, which were supposed to be a game changer for countries that needed to get funds. He also promised to build Bitcoin City and to purchase $500 million dollars worth of Bitcoin. None of that happened because the Volcano Bonds are dead-on-arrival. BlockStream is no longer involved, a crypto securities law was not approved by Salvadoran Congress, and the Bitcoin price crashed.¬†The excuse was that the government was fighting a war against gangs, which would be wonderful if it weren't for the fact that the Bukele Administration is arresting people without a warrant and imprisoning people without the right to a fair trial.

While salvadorans were being arrested without warrants, Bukele kept ""buying the dip"", using taxpayers' money of course. El Salvador is down over $58 million dollars, which it is a huge amount of money for a poor country.

People are no longer protesting about the Bitcoin Law, instead are demanding information about how much money was used to fund this experiment. Nayib Bukele has been classifying any information regarding the implementation of Bitcoin as legal tender until 2029. As of right now, no one knows who holds the keys of the wallet that holds the Bitcoins purchased by Bukele. In fact, no one knows if any Bitcoin was purchased at all! We have to blindly trust Bukele tweets.

Look, I've been accused of being funded by George Soros, being a NoCoiner, a ButtCoiner, and even of being paid by one of El Salvador's opposition parties. None of that is true, heck I even bought Solana, Algo, Voyager, ETH, BTC, VET at the ATH and considering selling some of my bag low. You can't ignore all the red flags around the implementation of Bitcoin in El Salvador. You can't ignore all the corruption and shady things that surround President Nayib Bukele. As much as I want Bitcoin to be adopted by regular folks, this is not the way. Supporting a undemocratic regime just because it hypes Bitcoin is not ok.

Why is there negative yield? Well because these strategies borrow ETH to leverage more stETH recursively. And the borrow rate of ETH has shot up over the last week or so. This means these yield strategies which were borrowing at 0.5% APY have suddenly seen their borrow rates shoot up to 8-10%. So the strategies are massively unprofitable right now. 

All these pools are earning negative yield, so users in them will look to exit.

However there is just 155k worth ETH in the Curve ETH/stETH pools, which has 530k stETH. So majority of that stETH cannot be exited given these circumstances.

Most crypto projects‚Äô tokens drop 90%+ within two years of launching. Why? It‚Äôs the supply and demand! Isn‚Äôt that why prices drop everywhere? Too much supply, not enough demand?

True, but in this article we‚Äôre going to dive deeper into how tokens allocated to insiders consistently prove to be the bane for web3 projects‚Äô token prices.

Like clockwork, when the vesting period for insiders ends, supply floods the market, demand doesn‚Äôt catch up and token prices slump.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ngmahab239m91.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ebaab2af20a4c1812195c9b675f2503f8758a2

## Vesting and the supply/demand imbalance

Treating token vesting like startup equity vesting has become common practice among web3 projects and DAOs. Unfortunately, [treating tokens like startup equity is a mistake](https://designingtokenomics.com/the-complete-tokenomics-primer/articles/tokens-startup-equity). They are very different mechanisms, with different liquidity profiles and ‚Äò[jobs to be done](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done)‚Äô.

The contradiction is simple: startup equity works because it‚Äôs locked up and aligns incentives for the long term. Tokens are liquid and therefore don‚Äôt align incentives for the long term. They can be sold, traded, or staked years before the project or DAO has reached maturity. Let‚Äôs see how you can analyze a project to avoid a 90% drop in a token.

## Token distribution: to whom, when and how¬†much

The first step is analyzing whom is owed how much of a token, and when they‚Äôll vest. Essentially you need to understand the distribution. Here is an example one of the better DeFi projects out there: [Liquity Protocol](https://docs.liquity.org/).

&gt;Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw interest-free loans against Ether used as collateral.

Liquity launched with a hard cap of 100 million $LQTY tokens. Here's the initial distribution:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yw57jaq439m91.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7002597f800eb80c17c27ec62f9bfcaf6f43bb6d

57.6% of tokens are allocated to insiders including the team and investors. 41.4% is allocated to the community, 1% to service providers. The top line sounds decent, with 41.4% going to the community. While some DeFi projects assign more to their community and less. to the insiders, that‚Äôs better than most startups for sure.

But you need to dive deeper to get the tokenomics understood properly. The community block is divided into two. 8.1% of tokens are allocated to the community reserve and endowment. These allocations are under the control of the Liquity team‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe don‚Äôt know when or for what they‚Äôll be spent. They could be spent all at once on a big marketing initiative or held in escrow for years. That‚Äôs a large supply overhang we have to deal with.

33.3% of $LQTY is allocated to the community on an algorithmic basis, using the same algorithm that Bitcoin uses, where issuance is halved. In the case of LQTY, halving events occur every six months instead of four years. This also sounds good‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääinflation will drop much faster than in the case of Bitcoin, which means that LQTY holders will be diluted less. But there‚Äôs a catch.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nh0t2sh839m91.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2222bda7d2eae611141f674f9160d18447d8bff2

While 33.3% sounds like a lot of the supply that we can forecast properly, it pales in comparison to the 57.6% of tokens that insiders control. To get a full picture of the supply coming online, we have to look at the insider vesting schedule.

## Insider vesting schedules

Liquity is a transparent protocol, so fortunately, we can find all the details for the vesting in their documentation.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7drcgxmb39m91.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41e4c2970973fb399db0c387c6e73ab06503c9e9

The 57.6% allocated to insiders have two very different lockup schedules. The team receives a quarter of its 23.7% after 12 months, and thereafter 1/36 each month. The investors on the other hand receive ***all their tokens*** after 12 months.

Unlike in startups, both parties can immediately sell or stake their tokens after 12 months. This is completely different than the classic use of ‚Äòvesting‚Äô in startups, where the equity is *earned* during the vesting period but never *liquid*.

Indeed, this dramatic difference in meaning and usage between web3 and startup equity leads to a huge increase exactly one year after the LQTY launch when a quarter of the teams ownership is unlocked and the entire investor stake is unlocked. With devastating repercussions for the price and retail holders of $LQTY.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Calculating token supply and¬†demand

Let‚Äôs analyze the supply and demand dynamics for $LQTY from launch through the first year and a half of the protocol.

## Analyzing the first¬†year

Let‚Äôs start with analyzing supply. During the first 12 months of Liquity‚Äôs existence. $LQTY is supplied and circulated on the market through three distribution mechanisms:

1. LQTY community rewards for the stability pool: This is 32% of the total token supply, which is distributed to people who provide a core function of the protocol. The distribution follows a six month halving schedule, so during the first 12 months 12 million LQTY are distributed
2. 1.3 million LQTY is distributed during the first six weeks to liquidity providers on DEXs
3. 2 million LQTY is earmarked for the community reserve and can be distributed.

This brings us to a to a maximum circulating supply of 15.5 million LQTY during the first year of the protocol.

What‚Äôs behind the demand for LQTY? As I laid out [here](https://designingtokenomics.com/the-complete-tokenomics-primer/articles/tokenomics-101-demand-part-2), demand comes from four things:

1. Token Utility
2. Memes
3. ROI
4. Governance

Liquity protocol is immutable, with no governance, so let‚Äôs scratch that off the list. Memes and a strong narrative haven‚Äôt quite coalesced around $LUSD, the core functionality of the protocol (although it‚Äôs starting to as $LUSD is arguably the only truly decentralized stable coin left). Which leaves us with token utility and ROI.

The utility LQTY grants is a revenue share of the Liquity Protocol. That‚Äôs the only utility it gives, and so in this case ROI and utility are one and the same. So what ROI was it granting during the first 12 months?

[üì∑Dune analytics by u\/dani](https://preview.redd.it/utju8xvh39m91.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=655411f72a00c8c277110ed3120b95e34c936e65)

During the first 12 months, protocol revenue was \~$24 million. Since that revenue is distributed to LQTY stakers, there‚Äôs a clear connection between how many stakers are out there and the ROI. With 15.5 LQTY in circulation, assuming everyone stakes, that‚Äôs an annual distribution of $1.5. That yield served as a demand floor for the token.

And while LQTY traded together with all of DeFi and crypto and took a large tumble, throughout most of 2021, it found a decent floor around the \~$5 mark. But what happened when month 13 came around and supply hit the market?

&amp;#x200B;

[üì∑LQTY price: May 2021 - April 2022](https://preview.redd.it/tq32l7jk39m91.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48980e342e80cfb3de0fe45546e55e76429ba900)

## 

# The supply-demand imbalance

When May 2022 hits, a lot of supply comes into the market. All of investors, advisors and the community endowment funds are now unlocked, as well as a quarter of the teams‚Äô $LQTY. Together that‚Äôs: 5,916,158 + 33,902,679 + 6,063,988 + 1,035,367 = 46,918,192 million tokens that hit the market all at once during month 13.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/omy74kdn39m91.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d569d4467a5667f8cfe829dbd9bf1db4a4703a99

On day 365 of the project we had 15.5 million tokens in circulation. On day 366 we‚Äôve 3x that. ***Tokens in circulation have grown 300% in one day.*** On the other side of the equation, demand hasn‚Äôt grown nearly at that pace. Protocol revenue has barely budged from \~$24m. This causes a huge mismatch between supply and demand.

&amp;#x200B;

[üì∑Dune analytics by u\/dani](https://preview.redd.it/hx2hf77p39m91.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=089f58f4446cd01a70c9d5288960b5b161245e97)

What DeFi has going for it which shouldn‚Äôt be taken for granted, is its transparency. Due to the Liquity team being completely transparent, it‚Äôs possible for retail token holders to see the supply dump coming, and indeed selling of $LQTY started early in 2022 and picked up steam during April, right before the supply unlock.

&amp;#x200B;

[üì∑Liquity price January 2022 - August 2022](https://preview.redd.it/wgetnaks39m91.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc3d55389e11128f46c93dfe1a39e465517980ec)

If you‚Äôre thinking, ‚Äúgreat! all the tokens are unlocked, the market has priced it in‚Äù, it‚Äôs not so simple. Most of the tokens that got unlocked didn‚Äôt get sold on the market‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääinvestors aren‚Äôt that stupid‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand preferred to wait for better prices. So where did those tokens go? Into the LQTY staking pool. The LQTY staking pool grew 3x from May through August‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin line with the growth of circulating tokens.

&amp;#x200B;

[üì∑Dune analytics by u\/dani](https://preview.redd.it/na6wcs3v39m91.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7afb05e317aaae8e8e82d80c64554397797cd84d)

Unfortunately, this has a huge, dampening affect on the price of $LQTY as the same amount of protocol revenue is now being distributed to 45 million tokens, instead of 15 million ones. This means that the yield and ROI has been reduced dramatically. Giving buyers less of a reason to buy the LQTY token.

## Why token prices drop¬†90%

While all crypto tokens trade with a very high correlation, as time goes by, the wheat will separate from the chaff and good tokenomics will be critical for project success.

The tokenomics of the Liquity protocol never accounted properly for the supply and demand imbalance that would occur exactly one year after the the token launched, and the results are easily foreseen. A 300% increase in token supply can never be covered by the growth in the protocol use. Only the best of the best startups achieve that kind of year over year growth. The mismatch in supply and demand floods the market with liquidity and inevitably, the token price drops. Worse, the supply overhang will take years to be worked out of the market.

While Liquity Protocol is a fantastic protocol and product, the tokenomics doomed the price and adoption of $LQTY from day 1, and it will take a long time for the protocol to shake off the repercussions.

They are performers indulging our worst nature ‚Äî our fear, our greed, our indulgence. But to have someone act like they ‚Äúactually‚Äù have the answers is completely asinine to me. They‚Äôre the worst kind of crypto YouTuber imo, and Ben Cowen stands out.

He is a shill, in sheeps clothing. He tries to play the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the answers‚Äù card, but please check out my premium list with access to all kinds of charts and data dashboards based on prior data that, in actuality, is no better at predicting what will happen then flipping a coin.

I have taken some time to look at some predictions Ben has made, of course always with the caveat, of ‚Äúbut don‚Äôt take my word for it‚Äù ‚Äúor don‚Äôt take this to the bank,‚Äù or, ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt financial advise‚Äù etc etc and he has made some huge miscalculations using his data dashboard, premium list croc ‚Äòo crap. The biggest swing and a miss is of course, his claim at lengthening cycles. He built his channel on this proposition, of course based on all kinds ‚Äúprior data‚Äù and cycle trends, blah blah, but as we know now, was wayyy off. Then he claimed to have developed a risk metric to identify areas of high and low risk in the market, which did roughly identified the April peak, but totally missed the November top. And most recently, he was going hog wild on his YouTube channel that BTC dominance would rise ‚Äúin virtually all scenarios‚Äù this bear cycle, and to trade alts and ETH to BTC. This proposition was of course made by drawing very‚Äù dubious‚Äù conclusions from prior cycle data. And holy shit was he wrong about that.

All of this is to say, be careful whose opinion you trust. Don‚Äôt be fooled. BC and everyone else is merely taking a blind shot in the dark, and trying to make a quick buck by building a platform where enough people buy into the charade. But save your time and money. DYOR, and Pick projects YOU trust and make investments that you think have staying power, and that‚Äôs it. 

No one sure as shit has a crystal ball, not on YouTube, nor on some premium list. It‚Äôs just some guy, or gal, capitalizing off your self-doubt, and fear. Don‚Äôt drink the kool-aid, especially, especially when they tell you it‚Äôs ‚Äújust dubious speculation, after all.‚Äù"|0.91|815|0|815

Ya know, the typical ‚Äúwho the hell would pay that kind of money for a JPEG‚Äù type stuff, but I‚Äôve always been really interested to see what they‚Äôll become and how they'll catch on. When Reddit‚Äôs NFTs came, and I saw some actual good art, I figured what the hell and bought one. At the very least I'll have an interesting profile picture and maybe something will become of them and I can make a buck.

It wasn‚Äôt until I actually started looking into the creators that I started realizing how cool these are. These are not people trying to get rich quick with some copycat NFT series. These are artists with big followings even outside of Reddit, who are active on Reddit which is why Reddit chose them, and who Reddit actually commissioned to create these unique collectible avatar sets. 

The main thing that impressed me is how the artists are compensated. On the initial sale Reddit gives 100% of the profits to the artists! Reddit takes out 5% to cover the minting and blockchain fees, along with some to fund the program, but ALL of the profit goes to the artist. If the avatar is resold, no matter how many times, Reddit takes a 5% fee and gives HALF of that fee back to the artist!

At first I didn‚Äôt see my avatar as an art piece I purchased. I just thought it would be a cool avatar. If you‚Äôre not familiar with art, artists will create a limited number of reproductions of one of their works, each reproduction with a serial number such as #22 out of 100, and they will never create more than that, which give the limited editions value. Lower numbers are more desirable, as are numbers with patterns or known combinations, and also the very last one in the set, but in a set with only a small limited amount they are all quite rare. To summarize, these collectible avatars are actual limited edition art pieces made by actual professional artists, released on a platform that generously gives back to the creators. That sold me.

Obviously these avatars are tied to Reddit (maybe in the future they could be synced to other platforms such as Twitter?) but what many people don‚Äôt realize is that Reddit is currently the 18th most visited website in the world and the 13th most visited in the USA. Reddit is now quite possibly the largest digital art gallery in the world. Reddit also has plans to launch their own marketplace where you can buy and sell the avatars.

Look at Aggregated CVD Futs. (futures) Stablecoin-margined (eg. ETH-USD) and Aggregated CVD Futs. Coin-margined (eg. ETH-BTC) charts. They had more upward movement with price than spot CVD. I think the whole move up was fuelled by futures contracts, both longing, short stops and liquidations. 
During 2021, often we would see all three charts move up together on the strong uptrends, but not now and not for a long time.

It‚Äôs only one small piece of the picture but I‚Äôm guessing the hype surrounding the merge has been played out and market is a lot more reserved/cautious about jumping onto the hype train because of the various factors we see today."|0.57|3|0|3

 The reason for the Market Dip is clear and simple.

The Stoachstic indicator failed to build a head and shoulders pattern, because the Difficulty Ribbon Compression was above the MACD but closed just barely under the Bollinger Bands. This resulted in a Death Cross built by the RSI. So as soon as the Alpha-Beta Trand channel crosses this line once again, we are free to move either up or down in the Klinger Oscillator, resulting in markets to stop dopping.

1. It works like a charm. Buy, mint, lands on profile in seconds and a few clicks. Soon can be send directly to another vault, alt account or third party wallet.

2. A lot of variations possible. It feels like DnD vs Pokemon. The craziest combinations you see fly by, and they all seem to fit perfectly although creators use way different styles. 

3. Reddit is one of the few social platforms that keeps dirt out of the house. The system of upvoting and sharp minds that correct and act on bullshit works very well. Whilst platforms like FB, IG and Twitter struggling to keep garbage out. 

Reddit will grow even more and will reach new audiences soon.

4. I never would buy an NFT from Opensea and such platforms. Since I got the free one and saw how nifty it‚Äôs being rolled out, I bought one from the store. Reddit feels different and trustworthy.

5. Ne pas pump et dump. Ofcourse there will be some manipulation from cheeky traders, but Reddit as a whole is based and will exist for a while. The rarity of first gen avatars (which are still available!) will be interesting. Free ones a bit less ofcourse, since less rare.

6. This is the best and easiest way to start with NFT‚Äôs. Make sure to open your vault first.

7. You wanted to be first right? Well you still early, early enough to catch a first gen. Some 10 dollar avatars already sold for mid high xxx prices. And this all happening in a bear market.

8. At this pace, first gen will be sold out end of the year, but my balls are tinkelin‚Äô and telling me it‚Äôs probably earlier.

9. No crazy prices, available from 9,99 up to 50, and the most expensive ones are sold out already. It‚Äôs fair launched and cheap.

Happy hunting and don‚Äôt spend too much, thats my only advice.

Brian Armstrong of Coinbase (which holds a lot of ETH involved on behalf of customers) replied B.

How can the entire Bitcoin global network have one mining pool that represents 10% of all hash rate?

This has to give people pause on what was supposed to be a decentralized system (yes, I also have BTC, who wouldn't?) 

If China actually did crack down completely on Bitcoin mining others would eventually pick up the slack, but look at the charts since the announcement. Maybe it's a good buying opportunity, but it's also a quick kick to the head that maybe this whole king crypto idea has some flaws. 

No matter what potential Bitcoin has as a store of value, a single mining pool at 10% of total hash rate isn't good for anybody except that pool, and even they appear to be a question mark right now.

t3_x7j0qf|1662491527|CryptoCurrency|This is why crypto has dumped so hard while stock is holding well.|"At least one part of the problem is this:

[BTC price \(above\) and Bitcoin Shorts on Bitfinex \(below\). The number you see down right is the number of BTC. ](https://preview.redd.it/a6xt9ww2cam91.png?width=788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1286cf6a362965c87cefc0a10c7f87a75cfbbde)

# What am I looking at?

It's the BTC price chart above BTC Shorts on an exchange called Bitfinex. People bet on falling prices and this is moving prices on its own - sounds crazy, but this is what happens.

When you open a leveraged short position, you borrow Bitcoin from the Exchange (a little simplified). Right after borrowing you are **selling these BTC** for USDT. Price is dumping, if you're lucky - or if you have opened such big short positions, that this alone will dump the price (as it happend today). After other people jump off the boat, price will dump even more. To close the short position, **you will have to buy BTC back** so you can give back the BTC you got from the exchange. You will have to pay a lot less for these BTC, since the price is so low. The difference will mostly be your profit!

In this case, on Bitfinex alone, over 1000 BTC have been put in short positions. To avoid arbitrage trades, this probably has happened on other exchanges, too.

# Is this the only cause?

No. Overall market situation doesn't really look funky right now. But leverage trading is accelerating other moves. We had this in 2021, too - but almost nobody on this sub could complain: millions of dollars in short positions have been liquidated (it's called a short squeeze) because of a pump in July. Since people have to buy back BTC to close short positions, price pumped even more.

# What will happen now?

If you look at long positions, it doesn't look good. The opposite of short is long, and these might get liquidated if prices drop further, leading to a long squeeze and even more dropping in price.

t3_x7it26|1662491028|CryptoCurrency|Why don't people ignore influencers|"Seriously though, all those scams, lies, bullshit around Web3 is because of nothing but *influence*. While people do have their own fault for falling into them because of greed and lack of knowledge, they still don't learn their lessons. About 90% of people who are into crypto have no actual idea of how it works, what is the blockchain and what does Web3 mean.

For most of the cases, influence is a terrible thing, and no one shouldn't have it especially in a world like Web3. People think they'll obtain knowledge from influencers... **no**. Learning about Web3 and crypto is like a baby learning how to speak (through it's own observation of language) it should be done by the person. DYOR means ""do your own research"", and a person who **doesn't say that** after talking about a project is a scumbag.

First learn how a computer works, then learn how code works, then look into blockchain tech and history, read about Satoshi Nakamoto's vision. And use proper sources for these which include facts, such as code documentation.
Use a site like honeypot.is or read a token's contract yourself to make sure it's not a scam. Cause tell you what, you can know that way and an attacker has no way to hide it. That's literally half of the reason why blockchains are ""open-source"".

For gods sake don't act on the opinion of that random guy on Twitter, people. These days the term ""influencer"" is mostly another word for ""puppet master"". They belong to the Web2 territory, and if by any means they pass the border, they should face consequences.

Edit: The reason why you should know how the system works is because you'd definitely want to know where your money goes.
Posts below have mentioned ""people want a leader that they can follow"". But believe me, you want to be the sole leader of your financial life.

t3_x7iqa0|1662490855|CryptoCurrency|GUIDE: How to access your MOON(s) and Reddit NFT(s) (with screenshots)|"I've seen more and more separate questions about how to do anything with your Moons or NFTs from Reddit. So I thought of making a how to GUIDE!

In this guide, step by step you learn to backup your reddit vault, setup your Metamask, access your reddit NFT, access your moons and hopefully you will get more interesting insights.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goal:** Access your moons and Reddit NFT.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step A: BACKUP your Reddit vault PROPERLY**

**Step A1:** Open the Reddit app

**Step A2:** Tap your profile icon

**Step A3:** Select Vault in the menu

**Step A4:** Tap the 3 dots

**Step A5:** Tap ‚Äòrecovery phrase‚Äô

**Step A6:** Write it down on paper, put the paper later in a safe when we finish everything.

**Step A7:** Manual backup the phrase in Vault in Reddit app ‚Äì You need to give the 12 words in the right order, which is easy cause you wrote them down. After this you have succesfully backedup your secret phrase.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step B: Download &amp; Install METAMASK**

I prefer Google Chrome for this wallet. In general a lot of people have safety concerns about Metamask. This is because people connect their wallets to everything, and you only need 1 wrong smart contract to connect to. So please connect your metamask as little as possible! (there are ways to revoke access etc, but this is a different guide for a different day).

&amp;#x200B;

**Step B1:**

[ Add Metamask to Chrome ](https://preview.redd.it/clg2ye0fa8m91.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbf966dde239f7a85079f9fbe4236835afa154b3)

‚ÄúAdd to chrome‚Äù button

&amp;#x200B;

**Step B2:**

[ Improve, or to not improve? ](https://preview.redd.it/4pulwi2ha8m91.png?width=303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e377f44ef52d865f16d177a51a1615672c4e141)

Your own choice ;)

&amp;#x200B;

**Step B3:**

[ We already have the Secret Recovery Phrase](https://preview.redd.it/6uow241ka8m91.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7b741368847c57bd187f1f4e7bc7cece33a8ab2)

Select ‚ÄòNo, I already have a Secret Recovery Phrase‚Äô

**Step B4:**

[ 12-word phrase we do have!](https://preview.redd.it/npx96sila8m91.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42927786ab310b6a71d47498fcb67225594fbe39)

By default it is on ‚ÄòI have a 12-word phrase‚Äô, which is the one we need. Fill out your 12 words in the correct order in these  fields.

**Step B5:**

[Password time](https://preview.redd.it/ghezu5oqa8m91.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fe38f923289ee2691e5ce1c976528bea5c8262c)

Below the 12 words (for me it shows in dutch) you have a new password field. Make a strong password (preferably with a password manager) and fill it out here in these fields. Tap the ‚ÄòI have read and agree‚Äô box and your wallet will be imported. You will get this confirmation screen:

[Congrats! You now have your reddit wallet imported to metamask.](https://preview.redd.it/vo9rc3lsa8m91.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f1379a568c03c26a12f56c3054b0d1b35060d47)

**Step B6:**

https://preview.redd.it/gnz90xwta8m91.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9de912bc16232ca368932a8fc9fe38b1795f2060

This is your wallet on the Ethereum network. In the next step, step C, we will add the polygon network.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step C: Add the ‚Äòpolygon‚Äô network to your metamask (for Reddit NFTs)**

**Step C1:**

[Add Network](https://preview.redd.it/x1rtlsu6b8m91.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=120ec065d60e621461fbae097888deb457876a4e)

Click on ‚ÄòMainnetwork‚Äô on top and then select ‚Äòadd network‚Äô

**Step C2:**

[Add the details below in the corresponding fields](https://preview.redd.it/i7mx0zt8b8m91.png?width=275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00e800571b38e1a36a0631ac161b645f9cb660f6)

Add these details, for copying purposes I‚Äôve pasted them here. If you don‚Äôt trust me, feel free to google ‚ÄòAdd polygon network to metamask‚Äô to verify the correct addresses for yourself.

* **Network Name:** Polygon
* **New RPC URL (Choose one of the following):** [https://polygon-rpc.com](https://polygon-rpc.com)
* **ChainID:** 137
* **Symbol:** MATIC
* **Block Explorer URL:** [https://polygonscan.com](https://polygonscan.com/)

Then click ‚ÄòSave‚Äô (for me ‚Äòopslaan‚Äô)

**Step C3:**

[Polygon network in Metamask!](https://preview.redd.it/awnlbxydb8m91.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1230ea6b3912aabcd5e5b367c3ecb34935b21d52)

The polygon network has now been added to your Metamask, in the top right corner you see ‚Äòpolygon‚Äô instead of ‚Äòmain network‚Äô and the native token on polygon is MATIC. The polygon network is needed for Reddit NFT trade.

**IMPORTANT:** Polygon is a different network. Sending ERC20 ETH from the main network to Polygon ETH will result in a loss of funds. This would need to be ‚Äòbridged‚Äô since it is another network. Another guide for another time ;)

**Step C4:**

Open [https://opensea.io/](https://opensea.io/) to see if you can find your NFT. You have to connect your wallet (I know I said before connect to little as possible, OS is relatively safe). Then click through and go to your 'profile'.

Mine was hidden, which happens with ‚Äòairdropped‚Äô NFTs automatically, cause often they are scam. But not our drip squad! Click on ‚Äòmore‚Äô, and select ‚ÄòHidden‚Äô (which has a 1 behind it, standing for my 1 NFT):

[Drip Squad](https://preview.redd.it/tv9e065hb8m91.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56961b084537bd499b59dd62de86def1655a5364)

**Step C5:** Unhiding your NFT. Click the 3 dots and select ‚Äòunhide‚Äô:

[Unhide NFT](https://preview.redd.it/i5klh8ikb8m91.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e210d6b011a592d4d93fcc0286ba81c8f6bf790)

**Step C6:** To trade this NFT you will need to pay a fee one time to ‚Äòactivate‚Äô your wallet, and per contract (nft collection) you will have to approve the collection for sales. Since it is on polygon, these fees are extremely low.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step D: Add the ‚ÄòArbitrum Nova‚Äô network to your metamask (for MOONS)**

This network contains the moons you have earned with the wallet we have imported earlier.

**Step D1:** Go to ‚Äò[https://chainlist.xyz/‚Äô](https://chainlist.xyz/‚Äô)

[Chainlist](https://preview.redd.it/pqzeffrmb8m91.png?width=339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=212dcfcac654c93bb22eef6339c31950ceb72291)

Please note this way we use chainlist and you need to connect your wallet. If you don‚Äôt want to connect, then find here the manual details:

¬∑ Network Name: arb-nova

¬∑ RPC: [https://nova.arbitrum.io/rpc](https://nova.arbitrum.io/rpc)

**AGAIN IMPORTANT:** arb-nova is a different network. Sending ERC20 ETH from the main network to arb-nova ETH may result in a loss of funds.

Otherwise if you are fine with connecting, feel free to continue with step D2.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step D2:** Search for 'Arbitrum Nova'

[Search Arbitrum Nova](https://preview.redd.it/evw25bznb8m91.png?width=335&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4cf8f1a25f326678130acf54e56f7e4183a1287)

**Step D3: Approve**

[Click on Approve](https://preview.redd.it/g5xq258sb8m91.png?width=332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae5b02d3e5ed9252f965735f47924e5e0b9f7ac3)

**Step D4:** Add the actual moon token, click import token

[Check the correct network is selected and then select 'import tokens'](https://preview.redd.it/jyo8na0ub8m91.png?width=233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3294620e708fb81a28b5979d6a7ec1841553b2a)

**Step D5:** Fill out the fields with the below info.

Again, this is sensitive **contract** info, so don't take my word up on it but verify the address. Below worked for me to see my moons.

In the prompt, fill out:

* **Token Contract Address:** 0x0057Ac2d777797d31CD3f8f13bF5e927571D6Ad0

Below info should fill automatically based on contract address, just give metamask 1 second to load:

* ¬∑ **Token Symbol:** MOON
* ¬∑ **Token Decimal:** 18

&amp;#x200B;

Now I see my amazing amount of moons back:

[MOON!](https://preview.redd.it/we2u12q1c8m91.png?width=351&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c07c02c10113a7e45f6f1e49285b9114559ba9ef)

Players who did so didn‚Äôt just lose the ‚ÄúEternal Orbs‚Äù they were put in debt; one individual received a -2,491,025 Orb debt which would cost over $35,000 USD to clear. This same person then discovered they couldn‚Äôt even play PVP matchmaking, even after spending $100,000 restoring the account because the ‚Äúmatchmaker couldn‚Äôt find an equal-level opponent.‚Äù

**In the current Web 2.0 gaming landscape gamers are essentially given 2 options:** 

&amp;#x200B;

*A. Rent items from the game developers.* 

*B. Or zero ownership / participation.*

&amp;#x200B;

**So how do NFTs fix this...?  Well, they can‚Äôt, not quite yet that is.** 

If we want gamers to view NFT integration advantageously some fundamentals need to be already established. First and foremost, games need to be GOOD, to change one‚Äôs opinion the gaming experience‚Äôs need to be either on par with or ideally exceed currently available experiences on Web 2.0. NFT games shouldn‚Äôt feel like NFT games if that makes any sense, a player should be able to hop into a game that has NFTs integrated and literally not know unless they are to make a in game purchase, trade, upgrade, etc. *(Obviously you would know prior to playing the game it is NFT based, but the more seamless the process the better.)*

All it takes is one great game to onboard tens of millions of players into NFT gaming, but that will not happen until the focus shifts from raving about the tech, to building undeniable experiences that trump the preconceived notions so many gamers have. In the past decade we‚Äôve seen many great titles rewrite the gaming industry‚Äôs status quo, and whether gaming studios realize it yet or not they have paved the way for the need of digital ownership through creating an authoritative monopoly over microtransactions / in-game purchases."|0.48|0|0|0
